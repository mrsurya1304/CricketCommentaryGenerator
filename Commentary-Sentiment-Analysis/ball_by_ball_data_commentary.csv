1,AFG,2,2.3,6,"Pathirana to Rahmanullah, SIX runs",picked up the short ball and helped it over fine leg for six. Got a top edge but he only needed to use the bowler's pace

1,AFG,2,2.6,0,"Pathirana to Rahmanullah, no run",slower ball to finish with a dot. And here's Sreshth to take you through to the end
1,AFG,2,3.1,1,"Hasaranga de Silva to Hazratullah Zazai, 1 run",full on off and the googly is drilled to long on with some power
1,AFG,2,3.2,1,"Hasaranga de Silva to Rahmanullah, 1 run",good length ball on off and turning into middle. Falls over slightly but gets a flick off his pads out of the way. To the man at deep square leg
1,AFG,2,3.3,2lb,"Hasaranga de Silva to Hazratullah Zazai, 2 leg byes","full ball, just outside leg. Zazai plays a paddle sweep, or atleast attempts one. Ball rolls past the keeper's right, and he comes back for two. Umpire confirms what I suspected: off the pads"

1,AFG,2,3.5,0,"Hasaranga de Silva to Hazratullah Zazai, no run","fullish on off. Zazai backs away, ends up being a tad too far to cut it well. Mistimed to the off side"
1,AFG,2,3.6,6,"Hasaranga de Silva to Hazratullah Zazai, SIX runs",there it is! The short-arm jab over deep midwicket. Tossed up on off. Zazai clears the front leg and then almost checks his slog after connecting with the ball.
1,AFG,2,4.1,6,"Theekshana to Rahmanullah, SIX runs",same treatment from the other end! Gurbaz moves across to the leg side and Theekshana follows him. Gurbaz gets low and plays a whippy sweep off his pads. Over deep backward square leg
1,AFG,2,4.2,6,"Theekshana to Rahmanullah, SIX runs",swatted over the bowler! Goes into the first few rols. Full and slightly wide. Gurbaz throws his hands at it with mid off inside the circle. Bit of a toe-end but there's enough power in those arms to clear long off

1,AFG,2,5.1,6,"C Karunaratne to Rahmanullah, SIX runs","welcome to the attack, says Gurbaz. Bit of a pace-off delivery just outside off stuff. Gurbaz doesn't commit early, lets the ball come under his eyeline, and then lofts it high into the night sky. Soars over wide long off"

1,AFG,2,5.6,4,"C Karunaratne to Hazratullah Zazai, FOUR runs",ends the powerplay in style! Even though this didn't go where expected. Full outside leg. Zazai makes room exposing all three stumps. Tries to smack it behind square on the leg side off his pads but it takes a thick edge and flies over the vacant slip cordon
1,AFG,2,6.1,W,"Hasaranga de Silva to Rahmanullah, OUT","much needed for Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankans can afford to smile. Hasaranga bowls it slow, length delivery on off and a googly as well. Gurbaz charges down the track to slog over the leg side but the ball falls well before him, turns past the edge, and crashes into middle and leg stump."
1,AFG,2,6.2,0,"Hasaranga de Silva to Ibrahim Zadran, no run",fullish on off. Punched off the back foot to cover

1,AFG,2,9.2,W,"Theekshana to Hazratullah Zazai, OUT","is he run out at the non-striker's? Oh dear, one of the worst ways to be out. Length all on leg stump. Zazai backs away and ends up flat-batting a shot straight back. Theekshana dives to his left, can't grab the ball completely, but gets a touch that takes the ball onto his stumps.

1,SL,1,0.1,1,"Fazalhaq Farooqi to Nissanka, 1 run","full on leg stump, and clipped off his pads. To the sweeper fielder behind square on the leg side"
1,SL,1,0.2,2,"Fazalhaq Farooqi to Mendis, 2 runs",overpitched ball on off stump. Bit of swing into him and he drives uppishly straight. Just over the bowler's grasp and Nabi has to run back from mid on to stop the boundary
1,SL,1,0.3,0,"Fazalhaq Farooqi to Mendis, no run",fullish on off stump. Angling across slightly. And left alone
1,SL,1,0.4,0,"Fazalhaq Farooqi to Mendis, no run",good length ball on middle stump. Angling away slightly. Poked to point

1,SL,1,0.6,W,"Fazalhaq Farooqi to Asalanka, OUT","is he one? Looks like! Gets this length ball landing outside off stump and zipping in, surprising the left-hander. He tried to shuffle forward to fend at it, but the ball whizzes past the inside edge and hits him in front of off stump. Asalanka considers reviewing but eventually doesn't, replays confirm that would hit top of middle"

1,SL,1,1.5,2,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Nissanka, 2 runs","slower ball. Length delivery wide outside off and the cutter jags in sharply. He comes down the track, swings across the line and mistimes a shot to the right of mid on"
1,SL,1,1.6,W,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Nissanka, OUT","full ball just outside off. Rolls his fingers over this delivery, and the ball ends up being a legcutter of sorts, holding its line instead of angling in with the arm. Nissanka tries to swing across the line, with an attempt to mow a shot over mid on, but the ball goes past the outside edge instead. Was there an edge? Umpire thinks so! But again there's a review: Sri Lanka ask for the TV umpire. Nervous Sri Lanka fans in the crowd as we wait for the ultraedge. And even though UltraEdge shows almost no deviation, the umpire says out! The Sri Lankan camp is stunned. Nissanka has to go while the Sri Lanka players still have their jaw on the floor."
1,SL,1,2.1,0,"Fazalhaq Farooqi to Gunathilaka, no run",full ball on off. Skidding into his pads as he presses forward to drive. Inside edged onto his pad.
1,SL,1,2.2,0,"Fazalhaq Farooqi to Gunathilaka, no run",full on middle and off stump. An on drive to mid on this time.

1,SL,1,3.3,6,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Rajapaksa, SIX runs","lovely pick-up, and Sri Lanka are off and away. Saw the slower delivery coming well in time, adjusted his position, and what a clean shot through the line that was! Carries all the way for a sizeable six."
1,SL,1,3.4,0,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Rajapaksa, no run","hard length this time, and it's defended back to the bowler"
1,SL,1,3.5,1,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Rajapaksa, 1 run","opens the face and runs it down to short third, who's sharp with his fielding"
1,SL,1,3.6,4,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Gunathilaka, FOUR runs","gorgeous. That's is sigh inducing. Majestic from Rajapaksa, who spots the width and the half-volley length, gets down on one knee and times it through extra cover."
1,SL,1,4.1,0,"Mujeeb to Rajapaksa, no run","that's brave, charging Mujeeb off his first ball. Doesn't time it, though"

1,SL,1,4.5,0,"Mujeeb to Rajapaksa, no run",this one's a touch too wide
1,SL,1,4.6,1,"Mujeeb to Rajapaksa, 1 run","clipped into the onside and he keeps the strike. Raced through that over, did Mujeeb"
1,SL,1,5.1,1w,"Azmatullah to Rajapaksa, 1 wide",dragged down legside
1,SL,1,5.1,1,"Azmatullah to Rajapaksa, 1 run","slashed away through the offside and gets the treatment it deserves. Short and wide, and an easy putaway"
1,SL,1,5.2,4,"Azmatullah to Gunathilaka, FOUR runs",scoops it over fine leg and it goes all the way! Picked up very cleanly and just used Omarzai's pace to carry it over the fence
1,SL,1,5.3,1w,,
1,SL,1,5.3,4,"Azmatullah to Gunathilaka, FOUR runs","makes room and thrashes it through the covers, and it's four more. Now the runs are flowing relatively freely."
1,SL,1,5.4,1,"Azmatullah to Gunathilaka, 1 run","and he's dropped a dolly! Afghanistan have suddenly lost their heads. That was a really ordinary over of bowling, and it's compoundedby a simple chance shelled at cover-point"
1,SL,1,5.5,4,"Azmatullah to Rajapaksa, FOUR runs","the carnage continues, I can barely keep this up. A classy little leg glance sees the ball race away for another boundary"
1,SL,1,5.6,4,"Azmatullah to Rajapaksa, FOUR runs","you guessed it, it's four more! Short, sat up for Rajapaksa and he pulls it away for another boundary. That's 20 in the over, or something like it, and Sri Lanka are wresting back control of this game."
1,SL,1,6.1,1,"M Nabi to Gunathilaka, 1 run",eased down to mid-off for a single. That's more the pace I can keep up with

1,SL,1,6.6,0,"M Nabi to Rajapaksa, no run","Tried to sweep it but misses. The keeper's convinced it's caught bat, but the umpire's not fooled, and declares it a wide. Afghanistan review Nothing on UltraEdge and this time the umpire decides to reprieve the Sri Lankan batter"
1,SL,1,7.1,0,"Mujeeb to Gunathilaka, no run",defended
1,SL,1,7.2,W,"Mujeeb to Gunathilaka, OUT","brought out the reverse sweep and while he connected well, he sends it straight down Janat's throat at deep point. Mujeeb strikes, and a colourful Sri Lankan partnership draws to a close"

1,SL,1,9.2,W,"Mujeeb to Hasaranga de Silva, OUT","Hasaranga heaves once more, and this time there's no salvation for him. Poor batting, this. This particular shot always looked low percentage, and he skied this to mid-off, where Mohammad Nabi made no mistake"

1,SL,1,9.4,4,"Mujeeb to Rajapaksa, FOUR runs",crunches this one past point. Rajapaksa's batting on a different surface. So quick to pick up the short length and dispatch it to the boundary

1,SL,1,12.3,W,"M Nabi to C Karunaratne, OUT","Whoa, I think this is another run-out, and so do Afghanistan! Another unbelievably unnecessary bit of running. he was never going to make it. The keeper has time to collect and whip off the bails, and Theekshana's on his way"

Anamul bends his back leg as he looks to pull-sweep it. Misses. The ball-tracking shows it hit him in front of middle and leg and would have gone on to hit the leg stump.

4,INDIA,1,13.3,4,"Yasim Murtaza to Yadav, FOUR runs","sweeps from way outside off and hits it behind square, past the fielder at deep square leg. Full, quite wide outside off, but that's no problem for SKY. Big stride forward, and nice low centre of gravity while playing the shot."
4,INDIA,1,13.4,4,"Yasim Murtaza to Yadav, FOUR runs","two in two! Another sweep, this one much finer, past short fine leg, and deep square leg can't cut it off either. Got into position early, and a simple choice for him given how slow the bowler is delivering 'em in."
4,INDIA,1,13.5,2,"Yasim Murtaza to Yadav, 2 runs","good length on off. Punched off the back foot to deep midwicket. Fielder is on the line, so these guys come back for the second run"
4,INDIA,1,13.6,0,"Yasim Murtaza to Yadav, no run","fullish, on off. Yadav stays on the back foot and gently taps it to the bowler's right. Murtaza finishes his four overs for 27"
4,INDIA,1,14.1,0,"Shukla to Kohli, no run","fullish on off, and a cover drive finds the infielder. Nice sound off the bat though"
4,INDIA,1,14.2,1,"Shukla to Kohli, 1 run","keeper standing up, by the way. Good length just outside off, and he flat-bats a shot to long on's right"

4,INDIA,1,14.4,1,"Shukla to Kohli, 1 run",good length ball angling into leg stump. Clipped off his pads to deep square leg once more
4,INDIA,1,14.5,4,"Shukla to Yadav, FOUR runs","his third boundary in six balls And once again behind square on the leg side. Full toss around leg, and Yadav swept it quite hard to fine leg. Fielder was there for the shot, but..... the ball bursts through his hands! Ehsan a bit lazy in his attempt, not getting low enough, nor getting his legs behind the ball by bending down"
4,INDIA,1,14.6,0,"Shukla to Yadav, no run","full ball just outside off. Yadav tries his well-tested sweep, but misses on this occasion. Smart grab by the gloveman"
4,INDIA,1,15.1,6,"Aizaz Khan to Kohli, SIX runs","full on middle. Kohli skips down the ground and gets to the pitch of the ball before lofting a six over deep midwicket. Sets the tone for the over, right from the first ball. Seems like Aizaz bowled a pace-off delivery, but no problem for VK"
4,INDIA,1,15.2,1,"Aizaz Khan to Kohli, 1 run",good length ball just outside off. Opens the bat's face and gets it to short third. A few metres on either side of the fielder and that was four
4,INDIA,1,15.3,4,"Aizaz Khan to Yadav, FOUR runs","strike rate of 237.50 with his fourth boundary in eight deliveries. Length ball, a bit wide outside off. Yadav backs away slightly and slashes hard, getting a thick edge on purpose over short third for four"
4,INDIA,1,15.4,6,"Aizaz Khan to Yadav, SIX runs","that's outta here! Full ball on middle. Suryakumar gets low, moves to the off side, falls over slightly, but in that process also ends up scooping a six over the keeper's left for six"
4,INDIA,1,15.5,1,"Aizaz Khan to Yadav, 1 run","offcutter, length ball outside off. Cut square, in the air for a bit, but lands well in front of deep point"

4,INDIA,1,15.6,1,"Aizaz Khan to Kohli, 1 run","he'll keep strike, and the over ends on 20 runs. Back of a length outside off, and he mistimes a pull to deep midwicket's left"
4,INDIA,1,16.1,0,"Ehsan Khan to Kohli, no run","the offie is back. Full just outside off, darting it in. Kohli tried a reverse paddle, but misses. Keeper gets low and collects."

4,INDIA,1,16.6,1b,"Ehsan Khan to Yadav, 1 bye","keeper can't collect, allowing India an extra run and bringing SKY on strike for the next over. Full and wide outside off, but inside the tram-lines. Suryakumar offered no shot, but the keeper can't take it on the half volley. Hits his glove and rolls away to short third"
4,INDIA,1,17.1,4,"Shukla to Yadav, FOUR runs",slapped over cover! Fullish just outside off. Suryakumar stands tall and hits it over the infield. Backed away oh-so-slightly before caressing it for the boundary
4,INDIA,1,17.2,4,"Shukla to Yadav, FOUR runs","make that a double, good sir! Short-ish ball just outside off. Suryakumar slashes hard at it, and gets an edge past the keeper, and it's raced past the short third fielder for four. Fifty partnership in 4.2 overs"
4,INDIA,1,17.3,1w,"Shukla to Yadav, 1 wide","full on leg stump and he tries the sweep. Misses, and very nearly clips leg stump. They also appeal for an lbw but the umpire puts his arms wide to give the extra. Replays suggest that hit his heel in front of leg - probably would've been out had they reviewed"
4,INDIA,1,17.3,0,"Shukla to Yadav, no run","is he stumped? Umpire is going up. Suryakumar attempts the ramp over the keeper off this short ball but misses. McKechnie collects in front of his eyeline and brings the hands down quickly to dislodge the stumps. Was his back leg outside the crease? Before we check the stumping, the TV umpire Asif Yaqoob wants to check if there was an edge off the bat. Nope, no edge, so we check for the stumping now. And Suryakumar is very safe, his back leg is grounded a feet or so inside the popping crease."
4,INDIA,1,17.4,6,"Shukla to Yadav, SIX runs","will that non-review hurt Hong Kong? Suryakumar joins Kohli in the forties with an outrageous flick off his toes over deep square leg! Full ball, and Suryakumar shows off how good his wristwork is."
4,INDIA,1,17.5,0,"Shukla to Yadav, no run","back of a length outside off. Tries the cut, perhaps got an edge, but the keeper can't grab it. Hits his glove and rolls away to short third. We need a replay to see if there was an edge or not..."

4,INDIA,1,18.1,2,"Ehsan Khan to Kohli, 2 runs","fullish on middle. Clipped to deep midwicket's right and skips back for the second run! Fifty - his 31st in T20Is, equalling Rohit's tally. A sedate celebration from him, but the pavillion is on its feet."
4,INDIA,1,18.2,1,"Ehsan Khan to Kohli, 1 run","full on off, and drilled to long on for a walking single"
4,INDIA,1,18.3,1,"Ehsan Khan to Yadav, 1 run","full on middle, almost a yorker. Suryakumar tries to play an inside out drive but hits the bat's inside half. Rolls away to midwicket"
4,INDIA,1,18.4,6,"Ehsan Khan to Kohli, SIX runs","class personified! Ehsan goes full and flat on middle. But Kohli clears the front leg, gets down on one knee, and picks it up beautifully to deposit a six over deep midwicket. A 91-metre six."
4,INDIA,1,18.5,2,"Ehsan Khan to Kohli, 2 runs",full toss on leg stump with Kohli backing away exposing all three stumps. Mistimed drive to deep extra cover's right for two more
4,INDIA,1,18.6,1w,"Ehsan Khan to Kohli, 1 wide","full ball, darted just outside leg stump, and to the keeper. Props to him for grabbing it low with Ehsan bowling it quick"
4,INDIA,1,18.6,0,"Ehsan Khan to Kohli, no run",finishes on 0 for 26 despite an expensive final over. Full ball on middle. Kohli tries to go over deep midwicket again but the shot hits his body
4,INDIA,1,19.1,6,"Haroon Arshad to Yadav, SIX runs","moves to 48 with that maximum! Full toss, wide outside off, and he slashes it rather beautifully over deep backward point! Wrists to the fore again, they need to be strong for a shot like that to go for six."
4,INDIA,1,19.2,6,"Haroon Arshad to Yadav, SIX runs","full and wide outside off. Suryakumar moves to the off side and slices a drive on purpose, and this has flown over deep point! A 22-ball fifty at a strike-rate of just under 250. A nice 69-metre six that gets Hardik clapping from near the dugout."
4,INDIA,1,19.3,6,"Haroon Arshad to Yadav, SIX runs",eighteen off the first three balls! Slower ball on off. Yadav keeps a still head and offers the full face of the bat as he lofts it over the bowler's head.
4,INDIA,1,19.4,0,"Haroon Arshad to Yadav, no run","short and wide, pace off this time. Tries to cut it behind square, but misses. On the bounce to the keeper"
4,INDIA,1,19.5,6,"Haroon Arshad to Yadav, SIX runs","fourth six of the over as this slow length delivery on his body is pulled behind square. Bit of a top edge as it goes behind the keeper for six more. Crowd catch too, it appears!"
4,INDIA,1,19.6,2,"Haroon Arshad to Yadav, 2 runs","a 26-run over to end the innings and India finish on an imposing 192 for 2. Length ball outside off.

5,SL,2,16.1,2,"Mustafizur to Shanaka, 2 runs","Banged in short outside off, was an on-pace ball. He keeps the pull down to wide long on and they take a couple of runs."
5,SL,2,16.2,4,"Mustafizur to Shanaka, FOUR runs","Edged and goes for a four. Oh, some luck now for Shanaka. Throws the slower length ball wide. Shanaka looks to force it through covers, edges and the ball races past the keeper."
5,SL,2,16.3,1lb,"Mustafizur to Shanaka, 1 leg bye",Angled into Shanaka who is rapped on the pads with the ball sliding down.
5,SL,2,16.4,1,"Mustafizur to C Karunaratne, 1 run","Banged in short on off, he gets well across and pulls to backward square leg"
5,SL,2,16.5,0,"Mustafizur to Shanaka, no run","Short and wide, but he does not find the gap on the cut. Finds point, who collects it on the bounce."
5,SL,2,16.6,1,"Mustafizur to Shanaka, 1 run",Back of a length angled into Shanka who punches to deep cover. There is a bit of a misfield but no harm done.

5,SL,2,17.5,W,"Mahedi Hasan to Shanaka, OUT","Down the ground and Mosaddek takes the catch! Is this the game? Was in the slot on middle, Shanaka gets a good piece of it but not enough and long on takes a simple catch. he was looking to hit it hard but failed to clear the ropes."

They take on the arm and has the dive saved Karunaratne? Yes, it has. He needed to get the dive in and he made it. The throw also wasn't the best, I must add. Wasn't as powerful and bounced before Mushfiqur took it."
5,SL,2,18.2,2,"Ebadot Hossain to C Karunaratne, 2 runs","Length on middle and leg, he gets across and works to deep midwicket. They once again take on the throw and make it much easily this time with the throw too wide."
5,SL,2,18.3,5nb,"Ebadot Hossain to C Karunaratne, (no ball) FOUR runs","He's got it past short fine leg. Uses the crease so well. Length well outside off, he gets inside the line and helps it over short fine leg. Oh, dear it gets worse. Ebadot has over-stepped."
5,SL,2,18.3,2,"Ebadot Hossain to C Karunaratne, 2 runs","Leg-cutter outside off, he gets deep in his crease, and slams it straight down. Shabbir runs across from long on, catches and releases the ball just as he was going over the boundary. Important runs saved"

Short of a length on off, he gets a leading edge to Shakib at short cover. They run, for some reason. Shakib waits for it and hits the stumps to find Karunaratne way short."

Haaaang on a minute, hang on a minute! The siren goes off, it's a no ball. Yes, nothing was behind the crease. Sri Lanka win by 2 wickets and with that they qualify for Super 4."
5,BAN,1,0.1,4lb,"Madushanka to Mehidy Hasan Miraz, 4 leg byes","Strays on the pads, and it's glanced fine for four! Great start for Bangladesh, bit wayward one from Sri Lanka and Madushanka."

5,BAN,1,0.3,0,"Madushanka to Mehidy Hasan Miraz, no run","Shape in from a length, bit of extra bounce. Miraz looks to drop and run but wisely decides against it."
5,BAN,1,0.4,0,"Madushanka to Mehidy Hasan Miraz, no run",beats the outside edge! This one shapes away a touch from a fullish length. Goes for the drive but is beaten for pace.
5,BAN,1,0.5,3,"Madushanka to Mehidy Hasan Miraz, 3 runs",Full outside off and wide. Slashes at this and gets the drive high over point for a couple as third man comes around to sweep up.
5,BAN,1,0.6,4,"Madushanka to Sabbir, FOUR runs","Paddle sweep down to fine leg! Bit of invention here, as Sabbir premeditates and just about gets the connection he wants.

5,BAN,1,1.2,2,"Theekshana to Mehidy Hasan Miraz, 2 runs","Full on off, driven to cover. It should be just a single but there's no one backing up at the non-striker's end and they get overthrows."

Shah is beaten on the slog sweep and hit on the pad. But I don't see any turn back in. The only way he gets the lbw then is with a really full ball that doesn't have time to angle past the off stump.

6,HKG,2,8.1,1,"Shadab to Haroon Arshad, 1 run",taps a full toss back to Shadab. Just over him. Shadab loses his balance. That means he can't jump high enough

Nope, it is certainly pad first, as it flips the flap of the back pad off a good length on off, with the ball skidding on off the surface. There wasn't much of a turn there, as he got his front leg out of the way to try and tried to poke at it but missed. Replays show there is umpire's call on impact, and also umpire's call on clipping the off stump. Hong Kong cleaned up for 38, which is 31 fewer than their previous lowest score in T20Is"

6,PAK,1,14.5,6,"Mohammad Ghazanfar to Zaman, SIX runs","ah, he gets one off the middle of the bat after hours of trying! Sweeps this across the line over deep midwicket, as this ball is full and quicker outside off. Went down on his knee, and sent that flying"
6,PAK,1,14.6,1,"Mohammad Ghazanfar to Zaman, 1 run","this again holds up in the pitch. On a shortish length on middle and off, as he sees Fakhar making room and skipping down. Nudged to long-on in the end"

6,PAK,1,15.4,6,"Yasim Murtaza to Zaman, SIX runs","this lands outside the stadium! Fakhar reaches fifty with a grand six. The left-arm spinner's slower ones and his angle helped there.

6,PAK,1,19.5,6,"Aizaz Khan to Khushdil, SIX runs","another six! Pakistan on their way to 190-plus now. This was full - and not far from the slot - on middle and off, as he hung deep in the crease and got his front leg out of the way before pumping it down the ground"
6,PAK,1,19.6,6,"Aizaz Khan to Khushdil, SIX runs","but it doesn't make a difference! That is 29 off the final over. This was a high full toss on leg, as he swivelled to swing that through the line and over fine leg. Looked like it could be an above-waist full toss, but no.

7,SL,2,1.4,1,"Mujeeb to Mendis, 1 run","fullish outside off and turning in. Mendis plays a late cut to short third and takes off for one. Is Nissanka in trouble? Throw is flat and on top of the stumps, but the side-on umpire is confident that the batter was in."

7,SL,2,2.3,0,"Fazalhaq Farooqi to Nissanka, no run","full on off stump. Pace off. Nissanka taps it back towards Mendis, and the bowler tracks to his left to intercept"

7,SL,2,2.5,4,"Fazalhaq Farooqi to Nissanka, FOUR runs",back of a length on middle. Nissanka not in control while trying to pull. Top edge over the keeper and that that has four written all over it once it landed beyond Gurbaz
7,SL,2,2.6,4,"Fazalhaq Farooqi to Nissanka, FOUR runs",much better from Pathum! Absolutely mows this full ball outside off by swinging across the line and smacking it to the cow corner fence

7,SL,2,3.2,6,"Mujeeb to Mendis, SIX runs","Sri Lanka getting a move on! And this time it is Mendis joining the party. A touch short from Mujeeb, and Mendis gets down on one knee before slog sweeping over deep square leg!"

7,SL,2,4.1,1lb,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Nissanka, 1 leg bye",back of a length ball originating outside off but angling into leg stump. Nissanka raises his front leg and tries to play a hook of sorts behind square. Comes off his body and rolls away to the leg side
7,SL,2,4.2,2,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Mendis, 2 runs","length ball outside off. Guides the cut beautifully, piercing the small gap between point and short third. But top commitment from the fielder who cranks up his speed while chasing the ball and manages to pull it back. Fazalhaq the man"
7,SL,2,4.3,0,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Mendis, no run",good length just outside off. Mendis looks to slog across the line with that incoming angle. But mistimed to midwicket
7,SL,2,4.4,4,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Mendis, FOUR runs","is he the bowler SL will try to take on? Surely looks like the way the strokes are being offered. Full on middle, and he flicks off his toes with the bat's closed face, and uses the angle successfully to get the shot past short fine leg!"
7,SL,2,4.5,1,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Mendis, 1 run","good length ball just outside off. Opens the bat's face and plays a punch off the back foot. Shinwari gets a hand to it at point, and Mujeeb covers him up by cleaning the effort up."

7,SL,2,5.3,1,"Rashid Khan to Mendis, 1 run",fullish on leg stump. The googly is worked off his pads off the back foot to square leg. Early call for one
7,SL,2,5.4,1,"Rashid Khan to Nissanka, 1 run","flatter, releasing this googly more from over his head this time. Lands full on off and turning in. Worked to midwicket"
7,SL,2,5.5,6,"Rashid Khan to Mendis, SIX runs","no you didn't, Mendis! Taking on the opponent's best bowler early. What a way to get to fifty. He has seen enough. Gets low early, centre of gravity quite low thus, and thereafter plays a slog sweep uppishly on purpose. Beyond deep midwicket"
7,SL,2,5.6,6,"Rashid Khan to Mendis, SIX runs","even better from BKG! Fullish on middle, and Mendis uses the googly to his advantage by clearing the front leg, swiveling slightly while getting down on one knee, and finishing it off by hammering a slog sweep over deep square leg."
7,SL,2,6.1,1,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Nissanka, 1 run","full on off. Walks into a gentle push to wide long on, and they are off for one"
7,SL,2,6.2,4,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Mendis, FOUR runs","he is flying! Carrying on from that Bangladesh game. Full and slightly wide outside off. A bit slow too. Mendis gets low and plays the drive over the infield, on purpose, and Afghanistan are lucky that did not go for six!"
7,SL,2,6.3,W,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Mendis, OUT",Massive wicket! Momentum broken. Mendis wants to continue hitting but Naveen has cramped him with a short ball angling into his chest. Attempts the pull but doesn't really have the opportunity to have a full followthrough of the shot. Down deep midwicket's throat.

7,SL,2,8.6,W,"Mujeeb to Nissanka, OUT","wicket off the wide ball! Nissanka gets back to cut off this wide ball outside off, but perhaps the extra bounce does the trick. Big edge, but swiftly into Gurbaz's gloves, so credit to him for grabbing onto it. No turn this time, looks like the carrom ball."
7,SL,2,9.1,1,"M Nabi to Asalanka, 1 run","around the stumps. Full on middle, and pushed to towards midwicket. Nabi gives the ball a chase"

7,SL,2,10.6,1lb,"Rashid Khan to Gunathilaka, 1 leg bye","Huuuge appeal for lbw! But the umpire is having none of it. This was another attempted slog sweep, and Gunathilaka misses again, struck flush on the back pad. It's pitching outside leg though."

7,SL,2,11.6,4,"M Nabi to Gunathilaka, FOUR runs","Dropped!! What a let off for Sri Lanka and Gunathilaka! Is he having a case of the Mendis's today? This was a top edge on another sweep, and it goes over the keeper's head but straight to fine leg coming in. But he gets nowhere near it, as the ball goes straight through his hands on to his chest, and then deflects to the ropes to add salt in the wounds."
7,SL,2,12.1,0,"Rashid Khan to Shanaka, no run","Rashid traps Shanaka in front! But the Sri Lankan skipper has reviewed. His only hope is that this is hitting outside the line. And it indeed is hitting outside, quality review. This was the googly, pitching outside off and striking the batter on the front pad as he looks to flick it."
7,SL,2,12.2,4,"Rashid Khan to Shanaka, FOUR runs",Swept to deep backward square leg for four! Great shot taking this from outside off.

7,SL,2,14.1,W,"Mujeeb to Shanaka, OUT","Brilliance on the boundary from Najeeb! This is a full toss that's absolutely creamed down the ground by Shanaka. It's hit flat and hard, but Najeeb balances himself on the line and takes it, with his back foot agonisingly close to the ropes. He's then about to go over so he pops it up, and takes it once coming back inside. And yes, the third umpire has given the all clear!"

7,SL,2,18.1,4,"Naveen-ul-Haq to Rajapaksa, FOUR runs","Smashed past deep cover! Geez that was timed sweetly! This was full outside off, and Bhanuka just spanks this drive. The fielder only has to move a few yards to his right but he has no chance."

7,AFG,1,0.2,4,"Theekshana to Hazratullah Zazai, FOUR runs","here we go! Width offered, a bit full outside off. Turning away and Zazai leans forward and creams a drive over mid off's right! Not much footwork, but when you time it like that, you don't need to do much."
7,AFG,1,0.3,1,"Theekshana to Hazratullah Zazai, 1 run","length ball, just outside off. Zazai again offers minimal footwork in his cut, and gets it to the left of point. Dive ensures it is just one. Nissanka the fielder"
7,AFG,1,0.4,1,"Theekshana to Rahmanullah, 1 run",off the mark. Over the stumps outside off and caressed to cover for a quick single. Direct hit could've been trouble though!
7,AFG,1,0.5,1,"Theekshana to Hazratullah Zazai, 1 run",fullish ball on off stump. Tapped to long on for a jogging single off the back foot. This one skid into his pads
7,AFG,1,0.6,0,"Theekshana to Rahmanullah, no run",even stevens after the first over. Neither side would be too disappointed. A fullish ball just outside off and turning into off. Punched back to the bowler
7,AFG,1,1.1,4,"Asitha Fernando to Hazratullah Zazai, FOUR runs","outside edge! Keeper dives! But just past him! Short of length on middle, and angling slightly across Zazai. He looks to poke at it, and that would've been gobbled up by first slip, had one been there."

7,AFG,1,2.4,6,"Theekshana to Rahmanullah, SIX runs","the crowd's on its feet! And what a shot to get the Afghan fans roaring. Full just outside off. Gurbaz gets low, down on one knee, and plays the slog sweep over the cow-corner region!"
7,AFG,1,2.5,6,"Theekshana to Rahmanullah, SIX runs","Theekshana has the last laugh! Or does he? Gurbaz tries to repeat it, but he can only get the height. Theekshana bowls a carrom ball just outside off, and Gurbaz tries to loft him over his head. But he's through the shot too early, it has come off the toe-end too, and Gunathilaka runs to his left from long off to take a reverse-cup catch. But wait, drama time! Gurbaz is waiting near the boundary line because it appears like the fielder's foot may be touching the boundary skirting here. Suspense.... And oooooo, Gurbaz gets a massive reprieve! Gunathilaka stepped on the skirting while trying to settle for the catch, and the umpire says that's half a dozen more!"
7,AFG,1,2.6,1,"Theekshana to Rahmanullah, 1 run","full on off. Presses forward, pushes to cover's left and takes off for a single."
7,AFG,1,3.1,6,"Asitha Fernando to Rahmanullah, SIX runs",Gurbaz-ball! Asitha bowls short around off. Gurbaz swivels and deposits a pull over deep square leg! Got inside the line with a swift shuffle that took him across the stumps.
7,AFG,1,3.2,2,"Asitha Fernando to Rahmanullah, 2 runs","full on middle, and clipped smartly off his toes to deep midwicket. Long on has to run to his right and cut it off"
7,AFG,1,3.3,4,"Asitha Fernando to Rahmanullah, FOUR runs","takes pace off, but ends up bowling it quite wide. Gurbaz is seeing these balls like watermelons and ends up scything a cut through cover point after moving towards the ball."
7,AFG,1,3.4,1,"Asitha Fernando to Rahmanullah, 1 run",Fullish just outside off. Forward defense to cover for a single
7,AFG,1,3.5,0,"Asitha Fernando to Hazratullah Zazai, no run",fullish on off stump. Punchy shot to cover's right for a single. Diving effort ensures the ball doesn't clear the infield
7,AFG,1,3.6,1,"Asitha Fernando to Hazratullah Zazai, 1 run",drops just short of the keeper! Length ball on a fourth-stump line and too close to Zazai for the cut.

7,AFG,1,4.1,0,"Madushanka to Hazratullah Zazai, no run","another edge - off the bat's bottom and falls just short of the keeper again! Looks to clip this length ball angling in, but the ball stays a bit low, takes the edge, and the keeper dives to his right to ensure he can stop it"
7,AFG,1,4.2,1lb,"Madushanka to Hazratullah Zazai, 1 leg bye","Zazai quite scratchy. Another length ball on off and Zazai looks to clip it leg-side. Off the bat's face, goes over leg stump, and towards short fine"

7,AFG,1,4.6,0,"Madushanka to Ibrahim Zadran, no run","one slip for the new man. Full outside off, plays the square drive, and wants the single. Hasaranga at cover point collects, has a shy at the batter's end after Zadran is turned down by Gurbaz, and he was gone had it been a direct-hit."
7,AFG,1,5.1,1,"Hasaranga de Silva to Rahmanullah, 1 run",googly to start off. Half-tracker outside off but sharp turn into middle stump. Gurbaz makes room and swipes it to midwicket

7,AFG,1,6.1,4,"Madushanka to Rahmanullah, FOUR runs","Team fifty in style! Off just 6.1 overs. Full ball on off. Gurbaz offers a compact defensive shot but ensured the bat's face is open.

7,AFG,1,6.2,1,"Madushanka to Rahmanullah, 1 run",fullish on off. Guided to deep third for another single by keeping the bat's face open
7,AFG,1,6.3,1,"Madushanka to Ibrahim Zadran, 1 run","full outside off. Driven uppishly, not in control, but over the infield. Protection in the deep."
7,AFG,1,6.4,1,"Madushanka to Rahmanullah, 1 run","good length ball on off stump. Tap-and-run after sending the ball to point. Fielder runs in and tries an underhand throw to attempt a direct hit, but Zadran would've been safe."
7,AFG,1,6.5,4,"Madushanka to Ibrahim Zadran, FOUR runs","deft shot! Madushanka goes short, aimed at his body. Zadran sways away but brings the bat up, and plays a ramp over the keeper's head! Nabi clapping from the pavillion."
7,AFG,1,6.6,1,"Madushanka to Ibrahim Zadran, 1 run",full on middle stump. Driven past the bowler to long on. Madushanka couldn't get low in time to stop it.

7,AFG,1,8.3,1,"C Karunaratne to Rahmanullah, 1 run",full on middle and leg. Clipped to deep square let and just like that.... he's got to fifty! Gets there in 22 balls. Gunathilaka must be hurting with every run that Gurbaz scores.
7,AFG,1,8.4,1,"C Karunaratne to Ibrahim Zadran, 1 run",length ball just outside off. Pulled to deep square leg for a single
7,AFG,1,8.5,1w,"C Karunaratne to Rahmanullah, 1 wide","full ball, just outside leg stump. Gurbaz gets low to try and sweep behind square but misses. No problem, Afghanistan get an extra run and the extra ball anyway."
7,AFG,1,8.5,0,"C Karunaratne to Rahmanullah, no run","back of a length outside off. Ball jags in sharply with Gurbaz attempting the pull. Ball goes under the blade to the keeper. Karunaratne is thinking there may be an under-edge. Shanaka checks with someone, and they review for caught behind after the appeal was turned down. Is this a desperate review because of the batter in question? Or was there some sound? The bottom-edge of the bat is awfully close to the ball, but UltraEdge shows a flat line. Review burned."
7,AFG,1,8.6,2,"C Karunaratne to Rahmanullah, 2 runs","back of a length ball on middle and leg. Looks to pull behind square, hits his arm, and rolls past short fine leg. Fielder Bhanuka gives it a chase, and pulls it back."

7,AFG,1,9.6,1,"Hasaranga de Silva to Ibrahim Zadran, 1 run","flatter ball, full on off. Punchy shot to wide long off. Hasaranga completes his third over and the umpires call for drinks"

7,AFG,1,10.2,1,"Shanaka to Rahmanullah, 1 run","fuller and quite wide of off, square drive into the covers"

7,AFG,1,10.6,2,"Shanaka to Ibrahim Zadran, 2 runs","length on the stumps, nudged softly towards midwicket, but with the men in the deep right on the boundary line the batters are able to scamper two comfortably"

7,AFG,1,11.2,0,"Madushanka to Ibrahim Zadran, no run","beaten on the outside edge! First false shot in a while. This is back of a length, angling away outside off, and he looks to punch this through the covers but is beaten by some subtle movement"

7,AFG,1,12.1,1,"Shanaka to Ibrahim Zadran, 1 run","full ball on middle, and he works it off his pads to deep midwicket. Fielder charges in to ensure that the batters don't consider a second run"
7,AFG,1,12.2,4,"Shanaka to Rahmanullah, FOUR runs","thick edge and teases short third before landing beyond him and running away for four. Full and wide this cutter, and Gurbaz loses his shape trying to loft it over the off side."

7,AFG,1,12.3,0,"Shanaka to Rahmanullah, no run",full ball just outside off. Gurbaz gives Shanaka a charge and tries to hammer a shot over mid on. But toe-ended to the bowler's left
7,AFG,1,12.4,2,"Shanaka to Rahmanullah, 2 runs","lands in no man's land as he swivels to slog this full ball over the square-leg umpire. Nobody at deep backward square, and the square-leg fielder runs near the boundary to pull the ball back"
7,AFG,1,12.5,6,"Shanaka to Rahmanullah, SIX runs","mistimed, but remember, Sharjah is tiny! Full ball, a bit wide outside off. Toe-ends the lofted drive, but he is arms are powerful enough to comfortably clear deep extra cover"
7,AFG,1,12.6,2,"Shanaka to Rahmanullah, 2 runs","short ball, outside off. Drags a pull to midwicket after the ball went high up into the night sky. But with the fielders on the boundary, he is very safe."

7,AFG,1,14.5,1,"Hasaranga de Silva to Ibrahim Zadran, 1 run","slightly fuller, another googly. This keeps low but Zadran negotiates it well. Stays back and punches this through the covers."
7,AFG,1,14.6,2,"Hasaranga de Silva to Rahmanullah, 2 runs","Great running! Pushed through flat on the stumps, this is worked to deep midwicket with soft hands and they steal two as the man in the deep is right on the ropes."
7,AFG,1,15.1,0,"Asitha Fernando to Ibrahim Zadran, no run","Shuffles around in the crease, as Zadran looks to premeditate the scoop. Asitha spots him and bowls this full outside off, and it ends up going through the batter's legs."
7,AFG,1,15.2,1,"Asitha Fernando to Ibrahim Zadran, 1 run","full outside off, gets low and drives this towards sweeper cover"
7,AFG,1,15.3,W,"Asitha Fernando to Rahmanullah, OUT","And Gurbaz's fantastic innings comes to an end! This was full outside off, and Gurbaz looks to heave this across the line.

7,AFG,1,16.2,0,"Theekshana to Ibrahim Zadran, no run","Appeal for a stumping, as Ibrahim goes for a big heave-ho and only ends up getting an inside edge on to his pads, through to the keeper.

7,AFG,1,18.5,W,"Theekshana to Rashid Khan, OUT","And is this another one!? Yes, yes it is! This is driven hard to mid-off and they look to steal a single. But the throw is a good one to the striker's end and Kusal picking up the ball in front of the stumps catches him short."

8,PAK,2,13.1,2,"Hardik to Rizwan, 2 runs","121kph, a slower length ball following the batter who was moving towards the leg side. Rizwan places it towards midwicket and sprints back for the second"
8,PAK,2,13.2,1,"Hardik to Rizwan, 1 run","length ball on the stumps, backs away and pulls it towards deep square leg"
8,PAK,2,13.3,4,"Hardik to Nawaz, FOUR runs",full outside off and Nawaz is hurting India here. Smashes it over covers for four. Moves to 28 off just 12 balls
8,PAK,2,13.4,0,"Hardik to Nawaz, no run","a slower length ball in the channel, Nawaz fails to spot it and ends up playing early. Was looking to smash it over extra cover but doesn't connect"
8,PAK,2,13.5,4,"Hardik to Nawaz, FOUR runs","Pandya goes for the yorker but it's all going Pakistan's way at the moment. Nawaz goes for the pull, is slightly late on it but the top edge sails over Pant for four more"
8,PAK,2,13.6,1,"Hardik to Nawaz, 1 run","a length ball around off, 129kph. Nawaz flat-bats it towards long-off where Hooda fumbles. It doesn't result in an extra run though"
8,PAK,2,14.1,4,"Chahal to Nawaz, FOUR runs","tosses it up on the stumps, Nawaz goes for the slog sweep and hits it to the right of the deep square leg fielder"
8,PAK,2,14.2,4,"Chahal to Nawaz, FOUR runs","another tossed up delivery but this is down the leg side. Nawaz sweeps it fine on this occasions, all along the ground to the fine leg boundary. This one was a googly"
8,PAK,2,14.3,1,"Chahal to Nawaz, 1 run",74kph. A length ball on the stumps. A reverse sweep in almost slow motion to pick up a single to short third
8,PAK,2,14.4,4,"Chahal to Rizwan, FOUR runs","length outside off. Plenty of room. Rizwan rocks back and cuts it to the right of the backward point fielder, who can only watch it go to the boundary"
8,PAK,2,14.5,2,"Chahal to Rizwan, 2 runs","length ball outside off, 75kph. Rizwan pulls it towards wide long-on and sprints back for the second"
8,PAK,2,14.6,1,"Chahal to Rizwan, 1 run","length outside off, Rizwan goes down on one knee and drags it towards deep midwicket"
8,PAK,2,15.1,1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rizwan, 1 run","length, wide outside off. Cuts it towards sweeper cover"
8,PAK,2,15.2,0,"Bhuvneshwar to Nawaz, no run","a slower ball banged into the wicket, and angling across. 121kph. Nawaz was early into the pull and misses"
8,PAK,2,15.3,W,"Bhuvneshwar to Nawaz, OUT","Bhuvi strikes. Short of length around off, rolled his fingers over it. Nawaz looks to go over long-off but it bounces a little extra and Hooda pouches it calmly at the boundary"
8,PAK,2,15.4,1,"Bhuvneshwar to Khushdil, 1 run","length outside off, pushed towards point to get off the mark"
8,PAK,2,15.5,0,"Bhuvneshwar to Rizwan, no run","length ball around off, was looking to work it towards leg side but ends up pushing it back towards the bowler"
8,PAK,2,15.6,2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rizwan, 2 runs","length outside off, a superb short arm jab towards deep midwicket. Hooda runs to his right from long-on, puts in the dive and flicks it back. Axar from deep midwicket tidies it up"
8,PAK,2,16.1,1,"Hardik to Khushdil, 1 run","length ball around off, a slower one. Steered towards cover"
8,PAK,2,16.2,4,"Hardik to Rizwan, FOUR runs","short of length outside off, moves across and smashes it in front of square leg for four"
8,PAK,2,16.3,2,"Hardik to Rizwan, 2 runs","full outside off, moves across but mistimes it towards wide long-on, off the inner half. But that allows him to come back for the second"
8,PAK,2,16.4,0,"Hardik to Rizwan, no run",length ball Rizwan moves across early. Hardik bowls it wide outside off and Rizwan fails to connect the drag-pull
8,PAK,2,16.5,1w,"Hardik to Rizwan, 1 wide",length and Hardik goes even wider this time but Rizwan didn't move across much on this occasion. Leaves it alone and picks up a wide
8,PAK,2,16.5,W,"Hardik to Rizwan, OUT","full, well outside off. Rizwan lofts it towards long-off but Hardik rolled his fingers over it, 129kph. That meant he didn't get the required distance on it despite middling it. Surya gobbles it up"
8,PAK,2,16.6,1,"Hardik to Khushdil, 1 run","length ball around off, pushes it to the right of short midwicket and sets off. Bishnoi charges in and underarms it towards the stumps. He misses; Khushdil was not even in the frame"
8,PAK,2,17.1,1w,"Ravi Bishnoi to Khushdil, 1 wide","dragged short and sliding wide outside off, goes for the cut but misses. It's a wide though"

8,PAK,2,17.2,1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Khushdil, 1 run","length outside off, steered to the right of backward point"
8,PAK,2,17.3,1w,"Ravi Bishnoi to Asif Ali, 1 wide","dragged short but down sliding down the leg side. Misses the pull but misses. It's been called a wide but India want to review this. There's a slight murmur as the ball passes the bat/glove but don't think it's enough to overturn the on-field decision. The third umpire is taking his time, looking at it from all angles. Split screen now. He is checking visuals as well as UltraEdge. And he asks the on-field umpire to stay with his not-out call"
8,PAK,2,17.3,0,"Ravi Bishnoi to Asif Ali, no run","dropped. Full outside off, Asif Ali goes for the slog sweep but ends up top-edging it towards short third. It's a dolly but think Arshdeep took a touch casually and grassed it"
8,PAK,2,17.4,1w,"Ravi Bishnoi to Asif Ali, 1 wide","slider, dragged down. Asif Ali misses the pull but it's another wide"
8,PAK,2,17.4,1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Asif Ali, 1 run","length ball around off, goes back and opens the face of the bat to steer it behind point"
8,PAK,2,17.5,2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Khushdil, 2 runs","full around off, flicked towards midwicket and they come back for the second"
8,PAK,2,17.6,1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Khushdil, 1 run","full on the stumps, clears his front leg and hits it towards deep midwicket, along the ground. Hardik charges in and throws it to the keeper to restrict it to one"
8,PAK,2,18.1,1w,"Bhuvneshwar to Khushdil, 1 wide",starts with a bouncer but it's way down the leg side. Khushdil was moving towards the off side and lets it go
8,PAK,2,18.1,1,"Bhuvneshwar to Khushdil, 1 run","full outside off, in the blockhole. Digs it out towards long-on"
8,PAK,2,18.2,6,"Bhuvneshwar to Asif Ali, SIX runs","Asif Ali! A length ball around off, was a legcutter. Asif Ali goes deep and towards the off side and smashes it 92 metres over long-on"
8,PAK,2,18.3,1w,"Bhuvneshwar to Asif Ali, 1 wide",another slower one. Asif Ali moves across again and looks to smash it through the off side. Misses but this has been called a wide. A touch harsh and Bhuvi isn't happy
8,PAK,2,18.3,1,"Bhuvneshwar to Asif Ali, 1 run","another slower one. A legcutter. Length outside off, Asif Ali looks to hit it towards extra cover but toe-ends it towards short third. Chahal is very fine there and stops it"
8,PAK,2,18.4,4,"Bhuvneshwar to Khushdil, FOUR runs","a bouncer and Khushdil goes for the pull. Gets a top edge and gets it to behind deep square square leg, just to the left of the fielder. One bounce and over the boundary line"
8,PAK,2,18.5,1,"Bhuvneshwar to Khushdil, 1 run","a yorker outside off, digs it out towards long-off"
8,PAK,2,18.6,4,"Bhuvneshwar to Asif Ali, FOUR runs","length outside off, Asif Ali goes over extra cover. And it just dribbles between Surya, the long-off, and Axar, the sweeper cover, for four"
8,PAK,2,19.1,1,"Arshdeep Singh to Khushdil, 1 run",nails the yorker. Khushdil inside edges it onto his toes as he looks to dig it out. The ball rolls towards covers for one
8,PAK,2,19.2,4,"Arshdeep Singh to Asif Ali, FOUR runs","a yorker gone wrong. A low full toss around off, Asif had already moved towards the off side and hits it straight over the bowler's head, bisecting long-off and long-on"
8,PAK,2,19.3,0,"Arshdeep Singh to Asif Ali, no run","full around off, hits it towards extra cover. A dot"
8,PAK,2,19.4,W,"Arshdeep Singh to Asif Ali, OUT","given lbw, Pakistan surely have to review this. And they do. Was a yorker on the middle stump. Asif was moving across and looks to flick. Misses it and is hit on the front shoe. And he is so deep in his crease. No bat involved and the rest is just a formality. Was hitting middle and off"
8,PAK,2,19.5,2,"Arshdeep Singh to Iftikhar, 2 runs",Iftikhar seals it for Pakistan. Arshdeep misses his yorker again and ends up bowling a full toss around off. Iftikhar hits it down the ground. Hooda cuts it off from long-on but slips as he is about to throw it. A weak throw means Khushdil makes it back comfortably
8,INDIA,1,0.1,0,"Naseem Shah to Rahul, no run","length ball just outside off, defended into the offside"
8,INDIA,1,0.2,1,"Naseem Shah to Rahul, 1 run","short and wide, slashed away to third man. No sign of movement yet"
8,INDIA,1,0.3,0,"Naseem Shah to Rohit Sharma, no run","well, there comes the movement. Landed outside off, comes back in. Smart leave from Rohit, though"
8,INDIA,1,0.4,4,"Naseem Shah to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","charges down the wicket like an aggravated rhino, and tonks that over cover for four! Didn't get all of it, mind you, but it was enough to clear the infield, and landed safely around a vacant deep cover"
8,INDIA,1,0.5,0,"Naseem Shah to Rohit Sharma, no run","fuller, defended into the offside"
8,INDIA,1,0.6,6,"Naseem Shah to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","absolutely glorious shot. Sharma at his effortless best. Rocks back and gently lifts Naseem over midwicket, and the easy power his timing generates makes the ball fly into the stands. Rollicking first over for India"
8,INDIA,1,1.1,1,"Mohammad Hasnain to Rahul, 1 run","length ball at 145 kph, eased to third man"
8,INDIA,1,1.2,0,"Mohammad Hasnain to Rohit Sharma, no run","extra pace and bounce - at 146kph. Reared up, and it barely beat the edge of Rohit's bat. Was a whisker away"
8,INDIA,1,1.3,4,"Mohammad Hasnain to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","that's lifted over mid-off elegantly. Not much wrong with the length but Rohit drives on the up, and times it perfectly once more"
8,INDIA,1,1.4,1,"Mohammad Hasnain to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","targets the stumps this time, and it's nudged into the onside for a quick single"
8,INDIA,1,1.5,2,"Mohammad Hasnain to Rahul, 2 runs",sliced over the covers. Not timed as well as Rohit but they come back for a couple
8,INDIA,1,1.6,1,"Mohammad Hasnain to Rahul, 1 run",nudged to mid-on and it's another quick single
8,INDIA,1,2.1,6,"Naseem Shah to Rahul, SIX runs","slower delivery, but KL Rahul sees it coming a mile away. Leans into a sensational off drive - no more than that, really - that sails over wide long-off. India have Pakistan's bowlers on the ropes here"

8,INDIA,1,2.3,0,"Naseem Shah to Rohit Sharma, no run","Fuller length, driven to the midwicket fielder"
8,INDIA,1,2.4,1,"Naseem Shah to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","thick edge, possibly a genuine edge. But there was no slip there. Rauf cleans up at third man to keep it to one"
8,INDIA,1,2.5,0,"Naseem Shah to Rahul, no run",defended to the offside
8,INDIA,1,2.6,6,"Naseem Shah to Rahul, SIX runs","whoa, that was almost a helicopter shot. Has he really played many shots like that? Absolutely absurd shot that sails over the straight boundary for six!"
8,INDIA,1,3.1,4,"Haris Rauf to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","a length ball outside off, Rohit lofts it over extra cover for a crunching four"
8,INDIA,1,3.2,6,"Haris Rauf to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","the carnage continues. Short ball, which Sharma picks up early, and dispatches over the cow corner boundary for a huge six! He's in absolute command right now"

8,INDIA,1,4.5,1,"Nawaz to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","angling into the stumps, nudged into the onside for a single"
8,INDIA,1,4.6,2,"Nawaz to Rahul, 2 runs",charges down the ground again. Doesn't get to the pitch but has what it takes to clear mid-on and pick up a couple more
8,INDIA,1,5.1,W,"Haris Rauf to Rohit Sharma, OUT","Rohit finally top edges one and holes out. It was up in the air for an eon and Fakhar Zaman and Khushdil Shah bumped into each other and nearly made a hash of it. Khushdil just about clings on - very good catch, really. Sharma's blitz comes to a close"
8,INDIA,1,5.2,1,"Haris Rauf to Rahul, 1 run","length ball at pace, tucked into the onside for a single"

8,INDIA,1,6.1,W,"Shadab to Rahul, OUT","charges down the ground, and holes to long-on. Shadab strikes off the first ball. Got to the pitch but got neither the power nor the elevation, and Mohammad Nawaz takes a smart catch"
8,INDIA,1,6.2,4,"Shadab to Yadav, FOUR runs","SKY doesn't hand around. Sees there's a bit of length and it's short, and immediately crunches it past backward point for four"
8,INDIA,1,6.3,0,"Shadab to Yadav, no run","played and missed. Close to the edge, and Rizwan, of course, is animated"

8,INDIA,1,8.5,1,"Shadab to Yadav, 1 run",works it to long-on for another single

8,INDIA,1,9.3,1,"Nawaz to Kohli, 1 run",slashed to long on after coming down the wicket
8,INDIA,1,9.4,W,"Nawaz to Yadav, OUT","holes out to square leg this time. Yadav made no attempt to keep that down, and the top edge meant it was straight down Asif Ali's throat. Promising little flutter of an innings comes to an end"

8,INDIA,1,9.6,1,"Nawaz to Kohli, 1 run","pushed into the onside, and the halfway mark arrives. India are 93 for three. Drinks are on the field, and Hemant's taking up the commentary from hereon."
8,INDIA,1,10.1,0,"Mohammad Hasnain to Kohli, no run","a length ball on the stumps and coming in. Kohli places it towards short midwicket and sets off. Pant takes a couple of steps down as well before sending Kohli back. The fielder has a shy at the keeper's end but misses. Kohli, though, would have been home"

8,INDIA,1,10.3,1,"Mohammad Hasnain to Kohli, 1 run",down the track and hits this length ball on the stumps aerially towards long-on. Didn't get the timing right though. One bounce to the fielder

8,INDIA,1,12.2,2,"Naseem Shah to Kohli, 2 runs",a slower bouncer. Kohli was looking to pull it but delays the shot and drags it towards midwicket. Comes back for the second
8,INDIA,1,12.3,1,"Naseem Shah to Kohli, 1 run",down the track but Naseem has bowled this on a hard length at the stumps. Kohli dabs it towards cover
8,INDIA,1,12.4,4,"Naseem Shah to Pant, FOUR runs","length ball around off, pulls it to the deep square leg boundary, second boundary of the over. The deep-backward square leg ran to his right but couldn't reach there in time"
8,INDIA,1,12.5,1,"Naseem Shah to Pant, 1 run","much shorter this time, a bit wider as well. Drags the pull towards deep square leg. The deep-backward square leg cuts it off this time"

8,INDIA,1,13.1,1w,"Shadab to Kohli, 1 wide",length but well outside off and spinning away a bit. Left alone to pocket a wide

8,INDIA,1,14.3,1,"Mohammad Hasnain to Kohli, 1 run","short of length around off, Kohli gives him a wee bit of room by moving towards the leg side. Pulls it down towards deep midwicket"
8,INDIA,1,14.4,W,"Mohammad Hasnain to Hardik, OUT",excellent catch by Nawaz! Was a cross-seam delivery around off. Pandya moved slightly towards the off side and it appeared he was a bit cramped as he punched it. Ended up hitting it towards short midwicket where Nawaz dives forward and to his left to take it with both hands
8,INDIA,1,14.5,4b,"Mohammad Hasnain to Hooda, 4 byes",a bouncer to welcome the new batter. Hooda looks to ramp it over the keeper's head but misses. Rizwan leaps to collect it but it flies over him.

The ball rolls to Arshdeep who has a chance to run Shanka out at the non-striker's end. He misses too, and they run back for two. Shanaka lost his bat while taking the first run but he scampers back, no bat in hand, puts in the dive and makes it. Arms aloft, he is all smiles. SL win by six wickets and have a foot in the final."
9,INDIA,1,0.1,1,"Madushanka to Rahul, 1 run",oh it swings right up but perhaps the 139ks means he gets his bat down in time. And this is swing away from around leg. Rahul gets a single off the outside edge. Can he swing it in?
9,INDIA,1,0.2,1w,"Madushanka to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","yes he can swing it in, but it is down the leg side. Called a wide"

9,INDIA,1,1.4,4,"Theekshana to Rahul, FOUR runs","lovely shot. He is down the wicket, close to the pitch of the ball, and he has gone against the turn of the offbreak and chipped it over extra cover. Late flick of the wrists"
9,INDIA,1,1.5,W,"Theekshana to Rahul, OUT","massive swing back in and given lbw even though he has skipped down the wicket. They have reviewed it. It is drifting in just like an arm ball but in the opposite direction. Rahul is completely flummoxed. It looks like it has beaten the inside edge and laned on the toe. Has it swung too much? Hang on, there is a sound signature as the ball passes the bat, but it looks like it is the bat hitting the boot. The third umpire says the same. And the ball tracker shows it is clipping leg. Rahul has to walk back"

9,INDIA,1,2.4,W,"Madushanka to Kohli, OUT","no need to wait for the 15 seconds here. His stumps are flattened.

If this is above his shoulder, this will be a no-ball. And it is above Hooda's shoulder even when he is off his feet. What looks like a wicket is a no-ball.

12,SL,2,7.4,6,"Usman Qadir to Rajapaksa, SIX runs","high-risk, high-reward! Tosses it up a bit more. Full, and a bit wide outside off. Rajapaksa gets low, down on one knee, and slogs it to deep midwicket for half a dozen. Clattered it even before we could see which direction the ball was turning."

12,SL,2,9.2,6,"Usman Qadir to Rajapaksa, SIX runs","easy, peasy, Japan-easy! Half-tracker on middle, and the googly turning away actually helps the batter free his arms the way he wants to. Pulls it as if he was hitting a medium-pacer, and this has gone into the second tier at wide long on"

They want to check..... Nissanka is safe."
12,SL,2,11.5,2,"Usman Qadir to Nissanka, 2 runs","good length ball on off. Bit of turn away. Flicked to square leg, where nobody is there. Fielder in the deep has to run in, and that allows them to pinch a second run."

Yes, confirmed, Rauf survives because of the bowler's error."

19.6,"Malinga to Thakur, OUT","Mumbai Indians win IPL 2019! Slower ball, yorker on middle, and the leg-side swipe has been missed by the batsman. Malinga appeals, and umpire Menon raises his finger. Was that going down leg side? We'll never know since Raina had used his review. Lasith Malinga has redeemed himself after that 20-run over."
19.5,"Malinga to Thakur, 2 runs","full toss on leg, and swiped away to deep backward square. Only two. CSK need two off the final ball"
19.4,"Malinga to Watson, 1 run, OUT","yorker, just outside off, and slapped to deep point. Ball races to the fielder in the deep, and they complete an easy single. But wait . Watson wants to come back on strike, and he's run out trying to complete the second run! Great throw from the deep, and terrific work from de Kock. New man in now with Chennai still needing four runs in two balls. Dramatic!"
19.3,"Malinga to Watson, 2 runs","yorker, just outside leg, and hammered to wide long on. They come back for the second"
19.2,"Malinga to Jadeja, 1 run","low full toss on middle, and drilled back to Malinga. He parries the ball to the leg side, and Jadeja scampers across for one"
19.1,"Malinga to Watson, 1 run","yorker, on leg stump, from around the wicket. Toe-ends the drive to long on"
18.6,"Bumrah to Jadeja, 4 byes","would you believe it? Quinton de Kock has let the ball go for four byes! The South African has let this go through. Back of a length, on off, and QdK can't hold on despite Jadeja missing the cut. Oh dear. CSK need 9 off the final over"
18.5,"Bumrah to Jadeja, 2 runs",swung away to the leg side but only to McClenaghan at deep midwicket
18.4,"Bumrah to Jadeja, no run","length ball, just outside off, and Jadeja can't play the cut. Through to the keeper and Bumrah gives the batsman a wry smile"
18.3,"Bumrah to Jadeja, 2 runs","full, just outside off, and he mistimes a slog to fine leg. They run hard, and comfortably complete the second"
18.2,"Bumrah to Bravo, OUT","given! Back of a length on off again, and angling in. This ball, nearly 149kph, snakes off the pitch and takes the outside of Bravo's bat as he tries to loft it over cover. QdK ain't missing that, and Ravindra Jadeja walks in at No. 7"
18.1,"Bumrah to Watson, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and pulled to Krunal at deep midwicket. Watson goes off strike"
17.6,"Krunal to Watson, 1 run","overpitched just outside off, and the slap has been stopped by Kishan at point! Crucial diving stop. That had four written all over it"
17.5,"Krunal to Watson, no run","full, fast, and wide outside off. Left alone by Watson, and not a wide"
17.4,"Krunal to Watson, SIX runs","into the second tier! Full, on middle, and Watson goes down on one knee again before clobbering a leg-side slog over deep midwicket. Watson hurting Mumbai after three dropped chances"
17.3,"Krunal to Watson, SIX runs","over Krunal's head this time! Back of a length on off, and Watson rocks back before lifting a back-foot punch into the sightscreen. Simply amazing. Class is permament, folks"
17.2,"Krunal to Watson, SIX runs","hammered! Full, too wide outside off, and Watson goes down on one knee before clearing a lofted shot over extra cover. There were two boundary-riders on the off side, but neither had any chance"
17.1,"Krunal to Bravo, 1 run","yorker, at the base of leg stump, and Bravo makes room before driving to deep extra cover"
16.6,"Bumrah to Bravo, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and fended off the back foot to cover. Just one. CSK need 38 off 18"
16.5,"Bumrah to Watson, 1 bye","wiiiild! Back of a length on middle, and soaring over Watson. QdK dives to his left to try and stop the ball, but the ball flies off his glove. An extra run for CSK"
16.4,"Bumrah to Watson, no run","hits Watson near the gut! Back of a length on middle, and angling into Watson again. He misses the pull, and the ball rolls away after hitting his body. Bravo wants a single, but he's been asked to go back. The direct hit from point doesn't bother umpire Ian Gould. Doesn't even go to the TV umpire"
16.3,"Bumrah to Watson, no run","fast! Back of a length, on off, and the ball whizzes past Watson's bat. Misses the attempted cut"
16.2,"Bumrah to Bravo, 1 run","once again, back of a length on middle and angling into DJ's body. Worked away to the leg side, rather uncomfortably"
16.1,"Bumrah to Watson, 1 run","back of a length, angling into Watson, and he's pulled this right in the air. Rahul Chahar gets under it from deep midwicket, and settles under it to take a catch, but my oh my, Chahar has dropped this!"
15.6,"Malinga to Watson, 1 run","yorker, around the wicket, and tapped away to point for one. Watson keeps strike"
15.5,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR runs","hello, rocket man! What power, what timing. Another full one outside off, and Watson goes deep into his crease before hammering a shot through the covers. Nobody bothered moving"
15.4,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR runs","slapped over short third man, and deep point can't intercept either! Too full, too wide, and Watson has muscled a sliced shot behind square"
15.3,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR runs","thick edge between short third man and the keeper! Full on off, and his attempted drive finds enough contact to go behind him for four. Watson won't mind"
15.2,"Malinga to Bravo, 1 run","another low full toss, but this is mistimed down to long on"
15.1,"Malinga to Bravo, SIX runs","bottom hand for the win! Full, on his toes, and flicked square over cow corner! What a start to the over. Misses the yorker, and pays the price"
14.6,"McClenaghan to Bravo, 1 run",makes room and forces this slower length ball to deep point.
14.5,"McClenaghan to Bravo, no run","banged in short, just outside leg. Watson ducks in anticipation of a wide but this is a good call from Ian Gould."
14.4,"McClenaghan to Bravo, 2 runs","slashes this as he gets onto the toes, down to square third man but it's a weak throw from Bumrah as they get back for the second"
14.3,"McClenaghan to Bravo, no run","beauty! It's the off-cutter angled across, Bravo looks to open the bat face to ease but is beaten"
14.2,"McClenaghan to Bravo, no run","punches straight to point, pressure building."
14.1,"McClenaghan to Bravo, no run",hops across and defends this short of length delivery
13.6,"Chahar to Watson, no run",punches straight to extra cover. End of an outstanding spell. 4-0-14-1. Time for a breather as they take the time-out
13.5,"Chahar to Watson, no run","put down!  This was drilled straight back to the bowler, bobbled out of Chahar's hand on the followthrough."
13.4,"Chahar to Bravo, 1 run","squared up by sharp turn, gets a thick outside edge to short third man as they scamper a single"
13.3,"Chahar to Watson, 1 run","skids one on middle, Watson gets besides the line as he defends for a quick single"
13.2,"Chahar to Bravo, 1 run",wrong'un which he eases wide of point
13.1,"Chahar to Bravo, no run","draws him forward in flight, Bravo defends"
12.6,"Pandya to Watson, no run","slower delivery outside off, Watson picks out short third man as he tries to steer it wider. Doesn't have the pace to work with again"
12.5,"Pandya to Watson, no run",bunts this to short third man
12.4,"Pandya to Watson, 1 run, OUT","has Dhoni been dismissed here stealing a second for the overthrow? Yes, yes. He is. Or is he? One angle says there's some doubt. Another suggests he's an inch short with the direct hit. In the end, he has been given. Dhoni started walking off even before the third umpire pressed the button. Then he stopped. Huge, huge moment in the match. Back to the ball: this was bunted to short fine as Malinga fired a throw at the bowler's end. They chanced a second because the mid-off fielder Ishan Kishan was a touch wide, but in thinking so, they may have been a tad too casual. Kishan moves to his left and hits direct at the bowler's end. Dhoni may have lost a split-second because he had to run around the bowler to get back into the crease. What a moment in the game."
12.3,"Pandya to Watson, no run",cuts this slower ball straight to backward point
12.3,"Pandya to Watson, 1 wide","bowls his too far wide outside off, and it's been called rightly so by the umpire as Watson let that go"
12.2,"Pandya to Watson, no run",chops this slower delivery to backward point. Pressure building.
12.1,"Pandya to Dhoni, 1 run",punched into the deep cover region
11.6,"Chahar to Watson, FOUR runs","sliding down and Watson sweeps, through Bumrah's legs to the boundary. Was placed specifically at short fine for the sweep. The bowler isn't amused."
11.5,"Chahar to Dhoni, 1 run","steps out and laces this wide of cover to get off the mark, off his seventh delivery"
11.4,"Chahar to Dhoni, no run",goes right back and bunts this to cover
11.3,"Chahar to Dhoni, no run",steps out and works this full delivery straight to short midwicket
11.2,"Chahar to Dhoni, no run",draws Dhoni forward and then gets it to beat the edge as he prods forward. Lovely from Rahul Chahar
11.1,"Chahar to Watson, 1 run",eased down to long-on
10.6,"Bumrah to Dhoni, no run",copy book forward defence to a full delivery. Superb over
10.5,"Bumrah to Dhoni, no run","leaves a skiddy length ball outside off, zips through to the keeper"
10.4,"Bumrah to Dhoni, no run",starts off with a jaffa! Angles in and holds its line as Dhoni pokes and misses
10.3,"Bumrah to Rayudu, OUT","has he got him? Yes, Rayudu walks. Ripper of a bouncer from Bumrah, Rayudu walks across to help this along but is beaten for pace as this flicks the glove on the way through to de Kock. Massive moment in the game. MS Dhoni will once again have to do all the heavy lifting to see CSK home."
10.2,"Bumrah to Watson, 1 run",hops back and angles this down to third man
10.1,"Bumrah to Watson, no run","slants in a skiddy length ball from wide of the crease, defended back"
9.6,"Chahar to Rayudu, no run","fullish, wide outside off, and he attempts to cut this late. Finds the fielder at point"
9.5,"Chahar to Rayudu, no run",teasing delivery full outside off. Rayudu steps forward to defend but the ball whizzes past his outside edge
9.4,"Chahar to Watson, 1 run","length ball outside off, and turning further away. Cut to deep point"
9.3,"Chahar to Rayudu, 1 run","googly, length ball outside off and spinning inwards. Pulled to deep midwicket"
9.2,"Chahar to Raina, OUT","Chahar celebrates even before the umpire raised his finger! Another skidder, length on middle and going straight through. Raina goes onto the back foot to defend, but he misses, and it hits his front leg. But Raina chooses to review after a long deliberation with Watson. Pitched on middle, impact on middle, and the ball would clip middle stump. Raina falls as Chahar drags Mumbai back into this game! Oh, and CSK lose their review as well. Ay Caramba."
9.1,"Chahar to Raina, no run","length ball on middle, and spins sharply into Raina. He tries to fend, but the ball has sneaked through to QdK behind the stumps"
8.6,"McClenaghan to Watson, no run","length ball on middle, and he tries to play a delicate late cut. Played to short third man"
8.5,"McClenaghan to Watson, no run","another slower ball, short and slow on middle. Mistimes a pull"
8.4,"McClenaghan to Watson, 2 runs","top-edged and Malinga drops the catch. Is this Watson's night? Length ball on middle, and Watson was through his pull too early. In the air for a long time, but Malinga - at square leg - cannot cover the ground. Attempts a valiant dive, but the ball didn't even get his fingertips. Yikes"
8.3,"McClenaghan to Watson, 2 runs","slower ball, full outside off, and Watson drags a slogged shot to deep midwicket. No real timing there, but that's what allows him to come back for the second run"
8.3,"McClenaghan to Watson, 1 wide","slower ball, full outside off, and goes through to the keeper. Umpire Gould calls it a wide, but replays suggest the ball was inside the tram-lines. Touch and go"
8.2,"McClenaghan to Watson, FOUR runs","hammered! Full, on off stump, and Watson's fast hands makes no mistake. Demolishes this half-volley past the non-striker to the long-off boundary"
8.1,"McClenaghan to Raina, 1 run","appeal for lbw again with the slower ball dipping in late. Raina flicked this to fine leg, but McClenaghan believes it went off the pads. Nah, they aren't reviewing. It definitely came off the bat"
7.6,"Chahar to Raina, 1 run","full on leg stump, and worked off his hips to deep midwicket. Tidy over, just the three runs"
7.5,"Chahar to Raina, no run","full on off, and the googly goes away from Raina. Steered to short third man"
7.4,"Chahar to Raina, no run",length ball on middle and turning into Raina. Tapped back to Chahar on this occasion
7.3,"Chahar to Watson, 1 run",length ball outside off and turning further away. Cut off the back foot to the fielder in the deep once again
7.2,"Chahar to Watson, no run",length ball on off and pulled off the back foot to deep midwicket
7.1,"Chahar to Raina, 1 run","length ball on leg stump, and nudged off his hips to square leg. Comfortably played"
6.6,"McClenaghan to Watson, no run","fullish, on middle, and he mistimes a leg-side clip. Inside-edged onto his pads. An entertaining over comes to a close"
6.5,"McClenaghan to Watson, no run","full on leg stump, and he misses the flick off this slower ball. Hits his pad, and Mitch appeals for lbw, but not given. Replays suggest it pitched outside leg"
6.4,"McClenaghan to Raina, 1 run","length ball on middle, and nudged off his pads to fine leg for a single"
6.3,"McClenaghan to Raina, no run","short ball, back of a length on middle, and the ball takes some extra bounce off the deck! Raina uncomfortably tries to defend, and the ball flies over his gloves and into de Kock's hands. Bowler appeals for caught-behind, and the umpire says out! Raina reviews straightaway. Replays suggest that Raina was right! No spike as the ball passes his glove. Looks like the decision has to be overturned, but before that the umpire wants to be sure he's got this right. Yep, not out! Umpire Gould changes his decision to 'one bouncer for the over'"
6.3,"McClenaghan to Raina, 1 wide","length ball o middle, and going down the leg side on this occasion. Wide called by the umpired"
6.2,"McClenaghan to Watson, 1 run","back of a length, offcutter on middle, and defended off the back foot to the off side"
6.1,"McClenaghan to Raina, 1 run","length ball on middle. Angling into his pads, and worked off his pads to the leg side"
5.6,"Malinga to Watson, no run","length ball, on middle, and nudged off his pads to the leg side. Timeout"
5.5,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR runs","back of a length, just outside off, and cut behind square past the fielder at point! Allowing Watson to free his arms, and he doesn't disappoint"
5.5,"Malinga to Watson, 1 wide","back of a length on off, and Watson tries to pull but misses. Ball flies over his head to the keeper. Watson's not happy, he says a few things we can't repeat and the umpire calls it a wide. Ian Bishop apologises on TV for Watson's language. Think Watson wasn't happy with a wide not given in the Bumrah over"
5.4,"Malinga to Watson, SIX runs","swiped! Full, on leg stump, and Watson simply flicks this over backward square for half-a-dozen. Watto spotted that slower ball (120kph) super early"
5.3,"Malinga to Watson, no run","length ball, just outside off, and cut off the back foot to point"
5.2,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR runs","sliced but just past Chahar at point! Solid, diving effort, but the drive still had enough behind that shot to run to the boundary"
5.1,"Malinga to Watson, no run","back of a length, just outside off, and fended off the back foot"
4.6,"Bumrah to Raina, no run",hops back and across to keep out this full delivery. Tight first over from Bumrah
4.5,"Bumrah to Raina, 2 runs",whips this over short square as he walks across. Ishan Kishan was standing right where the ball went and was moved out only a ball earlier to leg gully
4.4,"Bumrah to Watson, 1 run",once again opens the bat face to ease this down to third man
4.3,"Bumrah to Raina, 1 run",glances this fine to fine leg to get off the mark
4.2,"Bumrah to Raina, no run","this is a snorter of a bouncer from Bumrah! Good evening, Mr Raina. He's as usual camping back, expecting this on his ribs and somehow sways out of the way. Terrific gather one handed by de Kock"
4.1,"Bumrah to Watson, 1 run","skids one through on off, steered to third man"
3.6,"Krunal to du Plessis, OUT","this time he's gone! Krunal sees him back away and fires this full and wide. Faf is so far off that he can't reach the ball and de Kock effects an excellent stumping. Rohit is pumped, Krunal is pumped. There's life in the game or what?"
3.5,"Krunal to du Plessis, no run","backs away and cuts, straight to short third man this time. Deceived in flight but went through with the stroke"
3.4,"Krunal to du Plessis, FOUR runs","makes room to open up the off side and slices this between cover and point. Wow, incredible batting this. The decision to follow him by firing it in isn't working for Krunal."
3.3,"Krunal to du Plessis, SIX runs","clean strike, clears long-on! Backed away again, but Krunal went full and this was right into his swinging arc. Lovely, lovely hit."
3.2,"Krunal to du Plessis, FOUR runs","steps out and thumps this over the bowler's head, no chance for mid-on. Watson had to duck for cover as this was drilled!"
3.1,"Krunal to du Plessis, no run","makes room, Krunal follows him, bunted to cover as he's cramped for room"
2.6,"Malinga to du Plessis, 5 runs","another risky run, this time they'll get four more because there's no one backing up. Faf had to put in a dive to beat De Kock's throw from behind the stumps. No one covering that from mid-on. This was another slower ball from Malinga, bunted behind the stumps. Even before Faf looked up, Watto was off, so he had no option but to go. It's all happening!"
2.5,"Malinga to Watson, 1 run","a direct hit at the bowler's end from point and Watson would've been walking back! This was a gentle bunt, waste of a run, loaded with so much risk. Ishan Kishan the fielder. Lucky break for Chennai Super Kings again"
2.4,"Malinga to Watson, no run","beaten again! Backed away to pick the gap behind point, deceived by the slower one. Pressure building."
2.3,"Malinga to Watson, no run","slower and fuller on off, Watson's feet glued to the crease as he defends"
2.2,"Malinga to Watson, no run","bouncer on middle, Watson hops back to keep that out"
2.1,"Malinga to du Plessis, 1 run","length outside off, punched to sweeper cover for an easy single"
1.6,"Krunal to Watson, no run","nicely held back, Watson gets a long way forward and defends"
1.5,"Krunal to Watson, no run",goes right back and across as he defends this flatter delivery back
1.4,"Krunal to Watson, FOUR runs",too full and Watson gets to the pitch and thumps this through extra cover
1.3,"Krunal to Watson, no run",bunts this with the spin to short third man
1.2,"Krunal to Watson, no run",crunched from the crease but hit straight to point
1.1,"Krunal to du Plessis, 1 run"," just eludes Krunal on the followthrough!  Stopped on Faf, who looked to work it to the leg side. Got a leading edge, finger-tips stuff. Lucky break"
0.6,"McClenaghan to Watson, 2 runs",pulled nicely but there's a man strategically placed in front of square - between deep square and deep midwicket - for the shot. Two it will be to round off the first over.
0.5,"McClenaghan to Watson, no run","bunted to point from the crease, this was bowled full and across again"
0.4,"McClenaghan to du Plessis, 1 run","full on the pads, flicked to Malinga at deep backward square leg"
0.3,"McClenaghan to du Plessis, FOUR runs","blitzed! Too full, a half-volley that Faf will put away 99% of the times. Crunched through extra cover. Couldn't have asked for an easier ball for his first runs"
0.2,"McClenaghan to du Plessis, no run","beaten as he looks to flay this on the up through cover. Lovely delivery, done in by the zip."
0.1,"McClenaghan to du Plessis, no run",driven back to mid-on. Hint of late inward movement for Mitch
19.6,"Bravo to Pollard, FOUR runs","slower ball, full outside off, and that's been smoked! Drilled through the covers and Chennai Super Kings 150 to win IPL 2019!"
19.5,"Bravo to Pollard, FOUR runs","full, wide outside off, and this time Pollard manages to free his arms. Smashes a four through the covers, and even manages to pierce the gap between deep extra cover and long off"
19.4,"Bravo to Pollard, 1 run, OUT","yorker, just outside off, and drilled to long off. They need to go for two, and McClenaghan is running to the danger end, but he can't make it back in time. Good news for Mumbai is that Pollard is back on strike"
19.3,"Bravo to Pollard, no run","yorker, but very wide outside off. Pollard lets the ball go despite not moving across, but Umpire Nitin Menon says that's a fair ball! Pollard throws his bat in the air, since he can't believe it"
19.2,"Bravo to Pollard, no run","through to the keeper! Full, slower from Bravo, but wide outside the tramlines. But since Pollard walked across to the ball, umpire Nitin Menon deems that a legal ball"
19.1,"Bravo to Pollard, no run","full, very wide outside off, and hammered past cover to wide long off. Rayudu goes around the boundary to stop the ball, but Pollard opts not to run! They could've taken two, but Pollard was never interested. McClenaghan did try to run though"
18.6,"Chahar to McClenaghan, no run","delightful! Slower ball, short on middle and teasingly over Mitch's bat as he tries to swing to the leg side. Great comeback for Deepak Chahar tonight after getting tonked by de Kock earlier in the evening"
18.5,"Chahar to McClenaghan, no run","length ball, wide outside off, and Mitch pulls off the back foot to midwicket"
18.4,"Chahar to Chahar, OUT","full on middle, and his attempted slog over cover is sliced only to mid off. Pollard hasn't crossed over either"
18.3,"Chahar to Chahar, no run","length ball on middle, and worked away to the leg side"
18.2,"Chahar to Pandya, OUT","yorker on middle, and Hardik can't flick it square. Ball hits his front leg, and Chahar appeals for lbw. Ian Gould raises the finger but Hardik reviews right away! Bat involved? Looks like the bat did not hit the ball, it only hit the ground. No edge according to UltraEdge so far, and replays show that ball would've crashed into leg stump. Big wicket for Chennai."
18.1,"Chahar to Pandya, FOUR runs","back of a length, wide outside off, and  Pandya flat-bats a pull through to the wide long-on boundary! Chahar tries for the slower short ball, but Hardik was up for the challenge. What timing!"
17.6,"Thakur to Pandya, 1 run","low full toss, very wide outside off, and thumped to long on for a single. Hardik keeps strike"
17.5,"Thakur to Pandya, SIX runs","helicopter shot with Dhoni looking on! The audacity! Love it. Full, on off, and Hardik stays really deep in his crease before letting his bottom-hand do the rest. The crowd roars!"
17.4,"Thakur to Pollard, 1 run","attempted yorker, but ends up as a low full toss. Drills a drive to long on"
17.3,"Thakur to Pollard, SIX runs","rubbing salt in Shardul's wounds! Back of a length on off, and Pollard rocks back deep before punishing Shardul for a six. Thumps a pull over cow corner"
17.2,"Thakur to Pandya, 1 run","up and over off the back foot, and Raina is getting under it from cover, but he's dropped it! Chinna Thala fails to hold on. How rare is that? This was a short ball from Shardul, and Hardik tried to lift it over cover, but alas"
17.1,"Thakur to Pollard, 1 run","full, on off, and driven down the ground to long on. Gives Hardik the strike"
16.6,"Tahir to Pollard, 1 run","length ball outside off again, and he pulls once more off the back foot. No real timing this time. Through to the fielder at cow corner"
16.5,"Tahir to Pollard, SIX runs","going, going, gone! Half-tracker from Tahir, sliding into leg stump and Pollard rocks back before pulling this over backward square. Massive"
16.4,"Tahir to Pollard, no run","full on off, and turning away after hitting the deck. Tapped off the front foot to cover for a quick run"
16.3,"Tahir to Pandya, 1 run","yorker on off, and Pandya does well to dig this away. Bunted back to Tahir"
16.2,"Tahir to Pollard, 1 run","slider, length ball outside off and zipping through. Tries to flat-bat this over long on, but doesn't find the connection. On the bounce to the fielder in the deep"
16.1,"Tahir to Pandya, 1 run","half-tracker, just outside off, and he offers the bat's full face to play this down to long on"
15.6,"Jadeja to Pandya, 1 run","faster one again. Length ball angling into his body, and drilled to long on once more"
15.5,"Jadeja to Pollard, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off. Punched back to long on"
15.4,"Jadeja to Pollard, FOUR runs","hammered over cover, but lands just short of the Chahar in the deep! Terrific commitment from Chahar to attack the ball, but the ball drops just in front of his dive and bounces away to the boundary. This was a fast ball outside off and Pollard slapped it over the infield"
15.3,"Jadeja to Pandya, 1 run","wide, length outside off, and cut of the back foot to the man in the deep. Just a single for Pandya"
15.2,"Jadeja to Pandya, no run","full on middle, and he takes a big stride forward to block. Ball rolls back to Jadeja"
15.1,"Jadeja to Pollard, 1 run","around the wicket, length ball outside off, and thumped off the back foot to long on"
14.6,"Tahir to Pollard, 1 run","skids one through on middle and leg, punches to deep midwicket"
14.5,"Tahir to Pollard, no run",lunges forward and defends
14.4,"Tahir to Ishan, OUT","backs away to hoick, top-edges the slog and point takes a dolly. Imran Tahir is off again. This is very poor application from Kishan. Looked edgy all evening and has succumbed to the man who has dismissed him four times in four matches earlier to this."
14.3,"Tahir to Pollard, 1 run",works this down to long-on
14.2,"Tahir to Pollard, no run",fired full to hit him on the pad as he looks to work it to the leg side
14.1,"Tahir to Pollard, SIX runs",goes straight and clobbers this into the sightscreen. There was a straightish long-on in place for precisely such a shot but he was happy to take him on. What muscle
13.6,"Jadeja to Pollard, 1 run","flatter one on middle and leg, he works this wide of midwicket for an easy single"
13.5,"Jadeja to Ishan, 1 run",whips this down to long-on again
13.4,"Jadeja to Pollard, 1 run",tucks this gently into the leg side for a quick single
13.3,"Jadeja to Ishan, 1 run",eases this down to long-on
13.2,"Jadeja to Ishan, no run",skids through to beat Kishan's edge as he looks to late cut
13.1,"Jadeja to Ishan, no run","sharp turn from length outside off, Kishan defends"
12.6,"Thakur to Pollard, no run","superb short ball again, just outside off, Pollard gets out of the way."
12.5,"Thakur to Pollard, no run","excellent short ball, rising in towards the body, Pollard hit on the ribcage as he walks down the pitch to meet it"
12.4,"Thakur to Ishan, 1 run",rolls off the pad to square leg as they scamper a leg bye
12.3,"Thakur to Krunal, OUT","beats him for pace and takes an excellent return catch as he hares across to grab it! Shardul, you beauty. Krunal, like de Kock, is beaten for pace as he looks to pull this skiddy delivery but gets it high on the bat. Lobs so high that Shardul has enough time to cover at least 20 yards but in trying to grab it the ball bobbles out. Somehow he still manages to retain his composure and take it on the second attempt. Heroic from Shardul as he tumbles over. What. A. Catch. No repeat of Krunal's heroics at the same venue where he delivered Mumbai the title in 2017."
12.2,"Thakur to Krunal, 2 runs","driven on the up into the gap at sweeper cover, Chahar cuts this off as he comes around"

11.4,"Tahir to Krunal, 2 runs","skids one across, Krunal plays this delicately past slip. Bravo gives it a good chase from short third man to pull it back in"
11.3,"Tahir to Krunal, no run",lunges forward and turns this gently into the leg side
11.2,"Tahir to Yadav, OUT","chopped on and Imran beings his victory run! The length does Surya in, looking to dab this past short third man but is cramped for room. Thick inside edge back onto the stumps. There wasn't much turn this time.  Tahir equals Rabada for most scalps this season - 25 "
11.1,"Tahir to Yadav, 2 runs",works this off a length into the gap at wide long-on. Lazy work in the deep. Should've been no more than a single.
10.6,"Harbhajan to Ishan, FOUR runs",picks this full toss into the gap at wide long-on and deep midwicket. Lovely wrist work from Ishan
10.5,"Harbhajan to Yadav, 1 run","fired full outside off, squeezes this to deep point"
10.4,"Harbhajan to Yadav, no run",pushes this length ball to short midwicket
10.3,"Harbhajan to Yadav, FOUR runs","goes through with the shot and just eludes Jadeja at deep midwicket. magnificent effort. Gets away with the release shot does Surya. Didn't get to the pitch of this tossed up delivery but went through with that whip. Top, top effort from Jaddu, running around the ropes."
10.2,"Harbhajan to Ishan, 1 run","brings out the switch hit but toe-ends this to point, they squeeze in a single"
10.1,"Harbhajan to Ishan, no run","sharp turn off a length, bunted to point"
9.6,"Bravo to Ishan, 1 run","full, on off and angling away. Muscled to long off for a walking single"
9.5,"Bravo to Ishan, FOUR runs","slower ball, but it's a full toss on leg stump, and Kishan swats this away behind square! Adjusts well to meet this ball late, and slog sweeps this for four"
9.4,"Bravo to Yadav, 1 run","full on off, and he walks across to the off side before driving down the ground. Mid-on intercepts"
9.3,"Bravo to Yadav, no run","back of a length, just outside off, and he goes onto the back foot to block. Ball rolls back to DJ"
9.2,"Bravo to Ishan, 1 run","through his shot early but nobody's there at mid-off. Length ball on middle, and Kishan mistimes his drive. Through to long on"
9.2,"Bravo to Ishan, 1 wide","back of a length, just outside leg stump, and soars over Kishan's head. MSD does well to jump and stop the ball with one hand"
9.1,"Bravo to Ishan, FOUR runs","welcomed with a four! Full, on Kishan's toes, and he clears his front leg before hammering a shot over mid on"
8.6,"Harbhajan to Ishan, 1 run","fuller, on middle, and thumped down the ground to long on for a single. Timeout"

8.2,"Harbhajan to Ishan, 1 wide","length ball very wide outside off, and turning further away. Kishan stretches forward before letting it go"
8.1,"Harbhajan to Yadav, 1 run","swept but only to the fielder at deep midwicket. Full on off, and Suryakumar goes across the line to try and meet the ball"
7.6,"Bravo to Ishan, no run","length ball, hard Test-match length. Lands on middle, and meets Kishan near his chest. Tapped back off the back foot"
7.5,"Bravo to Ishan, no run","length ball on middle, and defended off the back foot to point. Protection there"
7.4,"Bravo to Yadav, 1 run","full on leg, and he offers the bat's straight face to drive down the ground. Long on runs to his left to clean up"

5.3,"Chahar to Ishan, no run","length ball on off, and angling further away. Left alone by the new batsman"
5.2,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, OUT","slower ball, and edged! MSD dives forward to complete the catch. Knuckleball just outside off, and Rohit tries to drive straight, but he's through his shot too early and Dhoni was not going to make any mistake. Terrific delivery from Chahar"
5.1,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, no run","overpitched, on off, and struck straight back to the bowler. He bends to intercept on his followthrough"
4.6,"Thakur to Yadav, no run","nice and full outside off, defended back"
4.5,"Thakur to de Kock, OUT","excellent comeback! Shardul has his revenge this time and he's done him in with a real quick delivery. Bounced on middle to cramp him for room, de Kock late on this, gets it on the glove and lobs behind to Dhoni who takes a dolly. Shardul gives de Kock a send-off and Hyderabad roars."
4.4,"Thakur to de Kock, SIX runs","slapped! This is gully cricket style. Fab shot. Saw him drop shot, reached out and was on one leg as he hammered this in front of square. Disdainfully done"
4.3,"Thakur to de Kock, no run",beaten as he bowls this full and wide as De Kock makes room to scythe that behind point
4.2,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","no point of that fielder if Shardul's going to bang it in. Pulled again  but Rohit gets this high on the bat, on the bounce to Harbhajan at deep square leg"
4.1,"Thakur to de Kock, 1 run",helped along one bounce to Tahir at fine leg
3.6,"Harbhajan to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","swept well, beats short fine! Harbhajan fired this on middle and leg, picked beautifully by Rohit."

3.2,"Harbhajan to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","shortish and spinning into middle and leg, punched to wide mid-on. de Kock turned for the second and had taken five steps in when he turned back.  De Kock turned blindly, didn't hear Rohit's call of 'no' "
3.1,"Harbhajan to de Kock, 1 run",driven with the spin to long-off
2.6,"Chahar to de Kock, 1 run",slashes hard to Harbhajan on the bounce at third man
2.5,"Chahar to de Kock, SIX runs","scorcher! Length ball slanted across, de Kock makes room and lofts through the line over mid-off. Pure hand-eye coordination this. Timing is incredible too"
2.4,"Chahar to de Kock, no run",wrists this full delivery on middle and leg to mid-on
2.3,"Chahar to de Kock, SIX runs","sliced for six! Backs away to go extra cover but doesn't quite get the timing or bat. Went off the thick outside edge. For a split-second, Harbhajan looked set to lap it up at square third man but watched this sail over in the end. Woah, how did that carry? I really don't know."
2.2,"Chahar to de Kock, no run",punches this length delivery to cover
2.2,"Chahar to de Kock, 1 wide","the consequence of that six is Chahar goes wider and ends up toeing the wide line. De Kock cleverly let that go. Extra ball, the bowler is under pressure early in the over"
2.1,"Chahar to de Kock, SIX runs","smoked! This is floated full and across, de Kock walks across and whips this over midwicket. Strong bottomhands, sailed over. Super hit, mind you it's a 73-metre square boundary. No problem, I'll hit it over and beyond."
1.6,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, no run",caresses this full delivery to Raina at cover point
1.5,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","that's what he can do often, does Shardul. Bowl beauties and then follow it up with half-trackers. Drops short and into the body, Rohit was waiting for it. Pulled imperiously over deep square. Super hit, so instinctive, very very effective."
1.4,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, no run","nice and full on the stumps, gets this to move away late again, Rohit jams his bat down in time to squeeze this to mid-on"
1.3,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, no run","beauty! When he gets it right, Shardul can get the ball to bend away. Banana swing this time, Rohit with no feet movement as he throws his bat at this to drive, beaten."
1.2,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, no run",mistimes a cut to cover point. Cramped for room again
1.1,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","length ball on middle and leg, Rohit works this into the gap at midwicket"
0.6,"Chahar to de Kock, no run","beaten by zip and extra bounce. Not much of pace or so to say, just 129.2kph, looks to flay that through point but is late on the shot."
0.5,"Chahar to de Kock, no run", nearly drags it onto the stumps!  Looks to thump this on the up through extra cover but didn't have room. The thick inside edge rolled onto the pad and nearly to the leg stump. Just wide. Slice of luck for Mumbai early in the piece
0.4,"Chahar to de Kock, no run","lucky to get away with this! Too short and wide outside off, de Kock reaches out and slaps this straight to cover point"
0.3,"Chahar to de Kock, no run",pitched up and de Kock drives but straight to extra cover
0.2,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short of length on middle and leg, nudged into the leg side for a quick single"
0.1,"Chahar to de Kock, 1 run","slants a short ball across, de Kock cuts and gets a thick bottom edge to Harbhajan at square third man"
18.6,"Sharma to Bravo, 4 leg byes","there it is, CSK are through to their eighth IPL final. Another bouncer, angling into the left ribcage. Steps across and fends at it, gets just enough on it to beat Pant throwing himself to his left behind the wicket"
18.5,"Sharma to Rayudu, 1 run","short, gets up to chest height on off stump, pulled through midwicket, along the ground"
18.4,"Sharma to Dhoni, OUT","short outside off, and Dhoni's pulled it straight to the man on the boundary! Keemo Paul hardly had to move there, at deep square leg. CSK will have to wait just a little longer"
18.3,"Sharma to Dhoni, no run","back of a length on off stump, punched to extra-cover"
18.2,"Sharma to Dhoni, 2 runs","down the track and Ishant tries to cramp him by bowling it full at his feet. Ends up as a low full-toss and Dhoni chips it back over the bowler's head. Munro does well to field it, running hard to his left at the long-on boundary"
18.1,"Sharma to Dhoni, no run","back of a length in the corridor, nips away off the seam, Dhoni jabs at it without any footwork and the ball beats his outside edge. Ishant's bowled a lot of this sort of ball in Test cricket of late"
17.6,"Paul to Rayudu, no run","length ball close to off stump, presses forward and pushes towards backward point"
17.5,"Paul to Rayudu, FOUR runs","short, wide, Rayudu gets on his toes and slaps it away to the backward point boundary"
17.4,"Paul to Rayudu, no run","slower short ball, jags in off the pitch from outside off. Rayudu is through his pull too early and the ball grazes his glove and hits his stomach"
17.3,"Paul to Rayudu, no run","bouncer outside off, Rayudu thinks of hooking, and in the end decides to drop his bat out of the way and evade it"
17.2,"Paul to Rayudu, FOUR runs","back of a length, angling down leg, and you can't keep bowling that line. Rayudu tickles it away nice and fine, and fine leg is once again too fine to be able to stop this"
17.1,"Paul to Dhoni, 1 leg bye","full, angling into the pads, clipped to fine leg"
16.6,"Boult to Rayudu, no run","on the fuller side of a good length on middle and leg, blocked back to the bowler"
16.5,"Boult to Dhoni, 1 run","digs it in short, gets it up near Dhoni's right collarbone. Rolls his wrists over to pull along the ground to fine leg"
16.4,"Boult to Dhoni, 2 runs","full on middle and leg, clipped to the left of fine leg"
16.3,"Boult to Dhoni, FOUR runs","short, down the leg side, and Dhoni helps it off his hip to the fine leg boundary. Fine leg was way too square to even think of stopping this"
16.2,"Boult to Dhoni, no run","very full, sixth-stump line, Dhoni doesn't really move his feet. Jabs at it and gets a thick inside-edge that pretty much doesn't go anywhere"
16.1,"Boult to Rayudu, 1 run","back of a length, angling across the stumps. Stays leg-side of the ball and jabs to deep point"
15.6,"Axar Patel to Raina, OUT","bowled him. There's already been one thick inside-edge in this over, and now he drags one onto his stumps. This was perhaps a touch too close to cut, and he goes at it with an angled bat and chops it on"
15.5,"Axar Patel to Rayudu, 1 run","flatter, on the pads, clipped through square leg"
15.4,"Axar Patel to Rayudu, FOUR runs","shot. Down the track, moving away from leg stump, and he gets into the perfect spot against this flighted ball to loft it inside-out over extra-cover"
15.3,"Axar Patel to Raina, 1 run","flat, back of a length outside off, waits on it and chops it through backward point"
15.2,"Axar Patel to Raina, 2 runs",down the track and Axar angles bowls it flatter and shorter outside off. Looks for the leg-side heave and drags an inside-edge past leg stump and the keeper
15.1,"Axar Patel to Raina, no run",flat length ball wide of off stump. Raina goes for the hard sweep and misses
14.6,"Mishra to Raina, 1 run","very full on off stump, jabbed down to long-on"
14.5,"Mishra to Rayudu, 1 run","flat legbreak on leg stump, swept along the ground to deep backward square leg"
14.4,"Mishra to Rayudu, no run","flatter and fuller, blocked back to the bowler"
14.3,"Mishra to Rayudu, no run","nicely looped up on middle stump. Doesn't get to the pitch with his front-foot stride. Wanted to drive to long-off, has to instead adjust and dab to backward point with an open face"
14.2,"Mishra to Raina, 1 run","slow legbreak outside off, waits on it and punches to the off-side sweeper"
14.1,"Mishra to Rayudu, 1 run","front-of-the-hand delivery, ends up dragging it short, pulled firmly and on the bounce to deep midwicket"
13.6,"Axar Patel to Raina, no run","flat length ball outside off, blocked back to the bowler"
13.5,"Axar Patel to Rayudu, 1 run","full on off stump, driven to long-off"
13.4,"Axar Patel to Rayudu, no run","flat, fairly full, speared in towards leg stump. Looks to work it leg side but it grips and turns and rolls off the leading edge to backward point"
13.3,"Axar Patel to Raina, 1 run","tossed up on off stump, clipped to long-on"
13.2,"Axar Patel to Rayudu, 1 run","length ball outside off, driven to deep extra-cover"

12.6,"Mishra to Raina, 1 run","tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
12.5,"Mishra to Rayudu, 1 run","flat on the legs, worked through square leg"
12.4,"Mishra to Rayudu, no run","length ball outside off, pushed back to the bowler"
12.3,"Mishra to Rayudu, no run","ooh, could easily have been a caught-and-bowled. Shortish googly spinning down leg. He picked the wrong'un, but it stuck on the pitch and popped up off the leading edge as he looked to work it into the leg side. Didn't pop back to the bowler, though, just a short distance towards extra-cover"
12.2,"Mishra to Watson, OUT","down the track comes Watson, and this time he's found the fielder. Mishra straightened his line, bowled it at middle and leg to cramp Watson slightly, and his lofted inside-out drive doesn't carry as far as he wanted"
12.1,"Mishra to Raina, 1 run","full outside off, driven to long-off"
11.6,"Paul to Watson, SIX runs","slower ball, full on off stump, and Watson miscues it for six to bring up his fifty. A little unfair on bowlers, this game can be. Watson went for the big hit over long-on, I think, and he ended up slicing underneath the ball and sending it hiiiiigh over long-off, but he's also managed to put enough into the shot for it to carry all the way"
11.6,"Paul to Watson, 1 wide","looks for the leg-stump yorker, ends up sliding down the leg side and forcing Pant into a diving save"
11.5,"Paul to Watson, SIX runs","slower length ball wide of off stump, and Watson gets a big stride out and fetches a slog-sweep all the way over the wide long-on boundary"
11.4,"Paul to Raina, 1 run","short, shoulder-high ball outside off, plays a checked pull along the ground to long-on"
11.3,"Paul to Watson, 1 run","slower length ball on off stump, clipped down to long-on"
11.2,"Paul to Watson, FOUR runs","short again, this time it sits up outside off and Watson pulls it over midwicket, into the wide open spaces at that boundary"
11.1,"Paul to Watson, SIX runs","shortish, angling down leg, and Watson just dismisses it from his presence, a whip off his hips that carries all the way over the backward square leg boundary"
10.6,"Boult to Watson, 1 run","length ball on middle stump, stays leg-side of the ball and opens his bat face to steer it to third man, past the diving backward point fielder"
10.5,"Boult to Watson, no run","in the blockhole on leg stump, jabbed back towards the bowler"
10.4,"Boult to Watson, no run","back of a length on the stumps, doesn't give Watson the width he was looking for while stepping away from leg stump. Dabbed towards backward point"
10.3,"Boult to Raina, 1 run","full, angling into the stumps, clipped through square leg"
10.2,"Boult to du Plessis, OUT","short on leg stump, and there's the breakthrough. Was a little cramped for room while looking to pull this, and he can't quite get the power on it to clear the boundary. Keemo Paul catches it diving to his right at deep square leg"
10.1,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","length ball close to off stump, slapped to short extra"
9.6,"Axar Patel to Watson, no run","nudged to point, but straight at the fielder"
9.5,"Axar Patel to Watson, SIX runs","slammed into the stands! Axar spears another one in at the pads, but Watson meets it with a huge slog sweep and connects well"
9.4,"Axar Patel to Watson, 2 runs","another paddle-sweep from Watson, and though there's a hint of top edge about this one, there's no-one at short fine leg"
9.3,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","eased down to long on, and that's fifty for Faf! His 12th in the IPL"
9.2,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, no run","chopped down towards point this time, but again they can't find a run"
9.1,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, no run","Axar darts one in at the stumps, Faf nudges to cover, but he can't find space for a single"
8.6,"Mishra to du Plessis, 1 run","Faf flicks off his toes, and the fielder is in quickly enough from long on to keep them to one"
8.5,"Mishra to Watson, 1 run","slashed uppishly and out to wide long off, where it's Munro again who cuts it off"
8.4,"Mishra to Watson, no run","punched to cover point, no run"
8.3,"Mishra to du Plessis, 1 run",
8.2,"Mishra to Watson, 1 run","Watson slog, skies and the ball goes almost straight up! But who wants it? Prithvi Shaw is close in , but it's Munro who runs in from long on   and he can't get to it in time! Really, that was Prithvi's catch. Munro had so much ground to make up, Prithvi was right there"
8.1,"Mishra to Watson, FOUR runs","lapped down to fine leg! The boundary down there was left open, and Watson bent low to fetch this from off stump and paddle it very fine"
7.6,"Paul to du Plessis, FOUR runs","this one keeps low! Faf lunged down at it as the ball crept through low, and just about got the bat there in time, bottom edging it past short third man. Munro hares after it, and slides into a dive at the boundary, parrying it back in. But is his foot in contact with the boundary as he does so? The TV umpire Shamshuddin checks out several replays and eventually decides that it's a boundary - and possibly a vital one. It was a very close call, and a tough one"
7.5,"Paul to Watson, 1 run","Paul finds some cut in to Watson off the track, but the ball is dead-batted into space on the off side and they sprint through for a single"
7.4,"Paul to Watson, FOUR runs","helped on its way! Paul bends his back to send this down at 138km/h, but it's a full toss outside leg and Watson just needs to put bat to ball to get his first boundary"
7.3,"Paul to du Plessis, 1 run","slower one, right down to 102km/h, and Faf waits to flick into the leg side"
7.2,"Paul to Watson, 1 run",a late dab brings a single to third man
7.2,"Paul to Watson, 5 wide","oh dear, the full pace delivery at 135km/h is sprayed down the leg side, evading a diving Rishabh Pant and racing away for five wides to bring up the fifty stand"
7.1,"Paul to Watson, no run","and he starts with a slow yorker, delivered at just 110km/h but right on target and aimed at Watto's toes"
6.6,"Mishra to du Plessis, FOUR runs","swept fiercely! Faf has well and truly got his eye in now, and he bends low to get himself in the perfect position to swat a sweep out to deep square"
6.5,"Mishra to Watson, 1 run","Watson lunges out at a full one, outside off, and drives to long off. He made sure to get forward"
6.4,"Mishra to du Plessis, 1 run","slightly quicker at 84km/h, and it looked like a googly too, but it's read and driven to long off"
6.3,"Mishra to du Plessis, no run","Faf puts a little more vim in this drive, but he can't beat the cover ring"
6.2,"Mishra to du Plessis, no run","wonderfully flighted outside off by Mishra, the ball arriving at 75km/h as Faf taps to point"
6.1,"Mishra to du Plessis, no run","leggie, floated up on leg stump, and Faf is forward to push to mid on"
5.6,"Sharma to du Plessis, 1 run","Faf is a little early into this forcing stroke as the ball seems to hold up a little, but the ball rolls into a gap on the leg side and they take a single"
5.5,"Sharma to Watson, 1 run","Ishant aims a full one for Watto's pads, a single into the leg side the result"
5.4,"Sharma to du Plessis, 1 run","shorter this time, and Faf rides the bounce to tuck a single square on the leg side"
5.3,"Sharma to du Plessis, FOUR runs","three in a row! Length isn't working for Ishant. Faf waits deep, and it's just short enough that he can muscle a pull out to deep midwicket"
5.2,"Sharma to du Plessis, FOUR runs","past a diving short third man! Faf knew Ishant would correct his line, and makes room to attack the off side. He doesn't keep the shot down, though, and it's not far away from the diving fielder inside the ring. Once past him, it's four"
5.1,"Sharma to du Plessis, FOUR runs","whipped behind square! Faf is reading the length very quickly tonight, and now he's also gifted a helpful angle by Ishant, helping the ball on its way down the leg side"
4.6,"Axar Patel to Watson, no run","Watson cuts again, and hits it better this time, but straight at the point fielder"
4.5,"Axar Patel to Watson, no run","Watson now looks to make room, but the ball rushes on to him, cramping a cut that goes nowhere"
4.4,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","good follow-up, Faf turning the strike over with a single"
4.3,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, SIX runs","moosed over extra! This is masterful from Faf, who backs away and powers the ball up and over the cover boundary"
4.2,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, FOUR runs","slapped up and over extra cover! Faf favours that area, and once again he makes room to set the shot up"
4.1,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, no run","Faf backs away, giving himself acres of room, but slices under the ball and very nearly spoons a catch to short third man, who stops it on the bounce"
3.6,"Sharma to du Plessis, 1 run","Faf and Watto are doing this in singles, as a shot comes off the toe end, trickling to mid on"
3.5,"Sharma to Watson, 1 run","nudged softly into the leg side, and there's room for a single"
3.4,"Sharma to Watson, no run","Watson waits and dabs late, but he can't beat short third man"
3.3,"Sharma to du Plessis, 1 run","worked off the straight by Faf, who collects another single out to deep midwicket"
3.2,"Sharma to du Plessis, no run","once again Faf is down the track, giving Ishant the charge, but he's undone by a change of pace, flinging his hands out way to early and missing the ball"
3.1,"Sharma to du Plessis, no run","Faf walks out at the bowler, slamming a drive to mid off. This time he doesn't opt for a risky single"
2.6,"Boult to du Plessis, 1 run","Faf whips across his pads, collecting a single into the leg side"
2.5,"Boult to Watson, 1 run","Boult finds some lift outside off, Watson milking a single down to third man"
2.4,"Boult to du Plessis, 1 run","another tip-and-run single from Faf, tapping to mid off and setting off. He's certainly keeping Capitals on their toes"
2.3,"Boult to du Plessis, FOUR runs","slugged over the leg side! Faf read the length on this early, and was ready and waiting in position when the ball arrived, pulling hard and in the air off the front foot"
2.2,"Boult to Watson, 1 run","angled down behind point, just the one"
2.1,"Boult to du Plessis, 1 run","another brave run! Faf pings mid off perfectly with his drive, but he was always going to run and he's quick enough to have his bat grounded inside the line by the time the shy swerves past the stumps. It was Shreyas with the throw"
1.6,"Sharma to du Plessis, 1 run","Faf is forward, on the drive, and aims his shot straight at mid off - but this time he calls clearly and early, puts his head down and gets home safely - though the shy also goes wide"
1.5,"Sharma to Watson, 1 run","Ishant hits a length on off stump, and Watto softens his hands to collect a quick single, close in on the off side"
1.4,"Sharma to du Plessis, 1 run","slower cutter from Ishant, Faf nurdling it into the leg side. There's another moment of hesitation before they complete the single  "
1.3,"Sharma to du Plessis, no run","angled in, on a length, and Faf is content defending from the crease"
1.2,"Sharma to du Plessis, no run","full, and Faf steps into a thundering drive, but the mid off fielder gets himself in front of it"
1.1,"Sharma to du Plessis, no run","rising up outside off, Faf standing tall to meet the ball and punching to point, where an athletic stop saves the run. Capitals are buzzing in the field"
0.6,"Boult to Watson, no run","inside edge, and it might have saved Watson as he's struck on the thigh. At least, it stifled Boult's appeal for lbw"
0.5,"Boult to Watson, no run","Watto looks for a dab down to third man, but he can't beat gully"
0.4,"Boult to Watson, no run","full, tapped to mid on. No attempt at the run this time"
0.3,"Boult to du Plessis, 1 run","chaos! What has gone out there? The ball was tapped to point and Faf set off, and then stopped. Watto, too, had started to run, stuttered, and now he turns back. The batsman meet mid-pitch in utter confusion! There are shies at both ends, but they both miss and - eventually - Faf gets down the other end for a single. Phew!"
0.2,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","big appeal! Boult snakes a fuller one in to Faf's pads and belts out an appeal, but the umpire shakes his head. And there's no review. It pitched way outside leg"
0.1,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","Boult, as is his wont, is right on the mark first up, curving a length delivery in towards Faf's off stump, but the South African skipper responds with steely-eyed and solid defence"
19.6,"Jadeja to Sharma, SIX runs","wow, what a finish, and from who! Down the track once more, and this time he makes himself a bit of room as well. Jadeja pulls his length back, and Ishant flat-bats it, middles it, and easily clears the boundary to the right of long-off"
19.5,"Jadeja to Sharma, FOUR runs","another great effort from Faf, but this time he can't stop it. Down the track jumps Ishant, and he gets close to the pitch and swats it hard and flat, back over the bowler's head, and Faf, throwing himself to his left on the long-on boundary, can't quite pull it back"
19.4,"Jadeja to Sharma, no run","back of a length on the stumps, jabbed hard, back to the bowler"
19.3,"Jadeja to Boult, OUT","similar line and length, but this time it's slower and slightly shorter. Boult swings too early, a little across it, and misses, and loses his leg stump"
19.2,"Jadeja to Boult, SIX runs","whoa. Flat length ball on leg stump, and he clears his front leg and hoicks it high over long-on. That was powerful"
19.1,"Jadeja to Boult, no run","flat, angling into off stump, and Boult jabs it back to the bowler, at catching height. Miraculously, Jadeja drops it despite getting both hands to it"
18.6,"Chahar to Mishra, FOUR runs","another full one on off stump, and this time Mishra steps across and flicks it behind square, up and over to the left of short fine leg. What a shot!"
18.5,"Chahar to Mishra, 2 runs","oh my, Faf du Plessis, what an effort that is! That's full, on the stumps, and Mishra flicks it - it's almost the helicopter shot - up in the air, times it extremely well towards the wide long-on boundary. Faf sprints at full tilt to his right, throws himself horizontally at the ball, and slaps it back into the field just as it's about to clear the boundary"
18.4,"Chahar to Pant, OUT","got him. Sticks to that line outside off, bowling the cutter into the pitch and making Pant fetch it against the angle. Goes for the big one this time, and can't get it far enough to the left of long-on"
18.3,"Chahar to Pant, 2 runs","the line was getting a little predictable, and he angles another back-of-a-length ball away from off stump. Pant reverse-swats it over backward point, but can't get too much power on it because it's another slower one. They run two even though he hit it close to the fielder at deep point, and Rayudu's throw misses the stumps with the batsman yards from making his ground"
18.2,"Chahar to Pant, 2 runs","back of a length now, digs this slower offcutter into the pitch, and angles it away from Pant's hitting arc. Again hits along the ground, and again into the gap between long-on and deep midwicket to pick up two more"
18.1,"Chahar to Pant, 2 runs","slower length ball angling away from off stump, hoicked along the ground between long-on and deep midwicket"
17.6,"Bravo to Mishra, no run","full on middle and leg, clipped to deep square leg. No single taken, and rightly so."
17.5,"Bravo to Paul, OUT","boom. Perfect leg-stump yorker, at full pace - 139kph, which is super quick for Bravo - and Paul is sure as hell surprised. Big backlift, clears his front leg, prepared to hit over the leg side, and suddenly the ball is hurtling towards his toe at unexpected pace. Before can bring his bat down the ball is past him and his stumps are disturbed"
17.4,"Bravo to Pant, 1 run","full outside off, too full to hit down the ground, driven to the left of deep point"
17.3,"Bravo to Paul, 1 run","slower length ball angling away from off stump. Looks to get down on his back knee to slog-sweep, and ends up inside-edging past leg stump"
17.2,"Bravo to Paul, no run","down the track and Bravo spears a full one away from his reach, outside off. Goes hard at it but can only hit it into the pitch and back to the bowler"
17.1,"Bravo to Paul, no run","shortish slower one pitching outside leg. Steps across to try and pull, and he misses. Doesn't miss the glove by much and the umpire doesn't call wide"
17.1,"Bravo to Paul, 1 wide","goes for the leg-stump yorker, ends up bowling it down the leg side"
16.6,"Tahir to Paul, 1 run","tossed up, wrong'un turning in from outside off, swept along the ground to deep backward square leg"
16.5,"Tahir to Pant, 1 run","full, driven towards long-on"
16.4,"Tahir to Pant, SIX runs","taken, juggled, taken again, but he's over the rope! The googly this time, loopy and outside off, and Pant loses his shape trying to slog-sweep, and hits it high towards long-off. Deepak Chahar is moving towards the boundary as he catches it, lobs it up in the air while stepping over the rope, and unfortunately for him the momentum means he's not succeeded in tossing it back into the field of play"
16.3,"Tahir to Pant, FOUR runs","length ball on off stump, legbreak, and Pant puts it away. Gets a big stride forward, plays the pull-sweep, and places it perfectly between deep midwicket and deep backward square leg"
16.2,"Tahir to Paul, 1 run","full on off stump, he's been very conscious about denying the batsmen elevation. Driven down to long-off"
16.1,"Tahir to Pant, 1 run","full on off stump, clipped away through midwicket"
15.6,"Harbhajan to Paul, no run","flat, back of a length, turning towards leg stump to cramp Keemo for room as he tries to create some. Punched back to the bowler"
15.5,"Harbhajan to Rutherford, OUT","gone. Length ball wide of off stump and Rutherford aims over the covers again, not full enough for it and it grips and turns. Slices off the outside half of the bat into short third man's hands"
15.4,"Harbhajan to Pant, 1 run","back of a length close to off stump, uses his wrists to work it into the vacant midwicket region"
15.3,"Harbhajan to Rutherford, 1 run","short again, not as much room to free the arms, cut to the right of deep point"
15.2,"Harbhajan to Rutherford, SIX runs","goes for short and wide again, but this time the ball sits up outside off, and Rutherford meets it with an amazing shot, slaps it hard and flat, all the way over the cover boundary"
15.1,"Harbhajan to Pant, 1 run","short and wide, deliberately bowled there, pretty slow too. Slapped to deep point"
14.6,"Bravo to Pant, 1 run","slower length ball pitching on leg stump, angling across towards off. Clipped away along the ground through backward square leg"
14.5,"Bravo to Rutherford, 1 run","in the blockhole close to leg stump, gets his front leg out of the way and clips to long-on"
14.4,"Bravo to Pant, 1 run","slower length ball on off stump, opens his bat face and dabs it a few yards to the left of Dhoni. Pant seems in a bit of pain as he completes the single"
14.3,"Bravo to Rutherford, 1 run","very full on middle stump, looks to clear his front leg and hit down the ground, but it's too full to get any elevation. All he manages is a single to long-on"
14.3,"Bravo to Pant, (no ball) 1 run","slower ball, ends up as a high full-toss on off stump - it's called no-ball - and Pant swings hard but only manages a single down to long-on, all along the ground off the high part of the bat. Tight call, may have been dipping below waist height"
14.2,"Bravo to Rutherford, 1 run","unlucky. Length ball angling across to off stump and Rutherford clears his front leg for the diagonal-bat slap down the ground. Hits it straight back towards the non-striker, and Pant tries to jump out of the way and juuust about fails to, gets a smack on his toe"
14.1,"Bravo to Pant, 1 run","slower ball, back of a length, angling across the stumps. Nudged quietly into the backward square leg region"
13.6,"Tahir to Rutherford, no run","full, quicker and straighter this time, on middle and leg, and Rutherford clips it back to the bowler"
13.5,"Tahir to Rutherford, no run","beaten again. Dangled up slower, another googly outside off, and he goes for the slog-sweep and misses"
13.4,"Tahir to Rutherford, no run","Rutherford is struggling to pick Tahir here. Another wrong'un, fuller, outside off. Makes room to slash through the off side and he can't put bat to ball"
13.3,"Tahir to Rutherford, no run","back of a length outside off, zippy googly. Pushes at it without moving his feet and the ball beats his outside edge"
13.2,"Tahir to Rutherford, 4 leg byes","dip and turn, and Rutherford is beaten in the air. Legbreak, tossed up, angling across initially and pitching outside off, and he comes forward to drive against the turn. The ball dips and turns to beat the inside edge and hit the front pad. Runs away past the keeper for four leg byes too. Big appeal for lbw, not given. Did it strike him in line? Dhoni has reviewed  Wow! It struck him in line with off stump, according to ball-tracking, but the ball was bouncing over the stumps!"
13.1,"Tahir to Pant, 1 run","shortish on off stump, makes some room to slap to sweeper cover"
12.6,"Bravo to Rutherford, no run","back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
12.5,"Bravo to Axar Patel, OUT","short, angling across the left-hander, getting up to about shoulder height, and Axar leans back for the ramp. Unfortunately for him, third man is back on the boundary, and all he does is hit it straight down his throat"
12.4,"Bravo to Pant, 1 run","length ball angling across towards off stump, lets it come on and guides it into the point region with an open face"
12.3,"Bravo to Axar Patel, 1 run","fullish on middle and off, driven to long-off"
12.2,"Bravo to Axar Patel, no run","back of a length on leg stump, defended back towards the bowler"
12.1,"Bravo to Axar Patel, no run","length ball slanting away from the left-hander into a sixth-stump line. Swings hard and misses, looking to hit over cover"
11.6,"Tahir to Axar Patel, 1 run","aaand again, Tahir keeps it full and on the stumps, and he shows the full face to pick up another single to long-on"
11.5,"Tahir to Pant, 1 run","tossed up once more, another drive to long-on"
11.4,"Tahir to Axar Patel, 1 run","loopy and full on middle stump, driven to long-on"
11.3,"Tahir to Iyer, OUT","big swing across the line, and a big miscue. Looked like the googly out of the hand, quite a bit of flight on it, and Iyer went for the front-foot hoick over square leg. It was the googly, but it didn't turn as much as expected, just bounced a little extra, and the top-edge swirls high in the air before Raina settles under it at backward point"
11.2,"Tahir to Pant, 1 run","fuller now, on off stump, driven to long-off"
11.1,"Tahir to Pant, no run","googly leaving off stump, not short enough to cut, Pant slashes and misses"
10.6,"Bravo to Iyer, no run","length ball on off stump, looks for the punch to long-on but hits it too close to midwicket, who quickly moves to his left to intercept"
10.5,"Bravo to Pant, 1 run","back of a length, angling across to off stump. Gets behind it and works it to the left of midwicket"
10.4,"Bravo to Iyer, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, punched to deep point"
10.3,"Bravo to Iyer, FOUR runs","full outside off, giving Iyer a bit of room to free his arms. He creates more by getting his front leg away from the line, and drives it along the ground to the left of extra-cover, and a long way to the right of deep point"
10.2,"Bravo to Iyer, no run","length ball on off stump, blocked towards midwicket"
10.1,"Bravo to Iyer, no run","full on off stump, flicked to midwicket"
9.6,"Tahir to Iyer, 1 run","nicely played, a dab to short third man, but it's just the one"
9.5,"Tahir to Pant, 1 run",tapped into space in front of midwicket for one
9.4,"Tahir to Pant, FOUR runs","lapped up and over short fine leg! Pant walked right across to off and set himself early, lifting the ball deliberately up and over"
9.3,"Tahir to Iyer, 1 run",an easy punch down the ground brings an ambled single
9.2,"Tahir to Pant, 1 run","very full, and Pant has to reach for this drive outside off, getting the ball down to long off"
9.1,"Tahir to Iyer, 1 run","pushed through at his legs, Shreyas driving through mid on"
8.6,"Jadeja to Pant, 2 runs","and he's off the mark straight away, sweeping hard into the deep for a hard-run brace"
8.5,"Jadeja to Munro, OUT","swept straight into his lap! Munro wants to slog sweep this into the stands, but he can't get the distance in the shot, and Bravo barely has to move at deep square leg. Capitals are losing their way  "
8.4,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run","pushed down the ground, one more"
8.3,"Jadeja to Munro, 1 run","swept in the air, the ball coming to ground well in front of the outfielder"
8.2,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 leg bye","Shreyas sets himself for a paddle, the ball rushing on and coming off his pad, rolling fine of short fine leg"
8.1,"Jadeja to Iyer, no run","nudged in front of point, and there's no room for a single"
7.6,"Harbhajan to Munro, no run","darted in a little quicker to finish, and Munro is content to just keep this one out"
7.5,"Harbhajan to Munro, FOUR runs","up and over, inside out! The ball is fuller, and straighter, but he opens the bat face to slice it into the gap"
7.4,"Harbhajan to Munro, FOUR runs",but this time he does! Munro breaks the quiet spell with a flashing drive through extra cover. The placement is perfect
7.3,"Harbhajan to Munro, no run","floated up by Harbhajan, and Munro can't thread the gap at cover"
7.2,"Harbhajan to Iyer, 1 run","some width outside off, but there's protection in the deep so it's only a single"
7.1,"Harbhajan to Munro, 1 run","Munro slashes under a drive, scooping it in the air through point - but the fielder's in the deep"
6.6,"Jadeja to Iyer, no run","darter from Jadeja, but even the quicker one grips and Shreyas has to hurry his dab to point"
6.5,"Jadeja to Munro, 1 run",glanced with the spin into the leg side
6.4,"Jadeja to Munro, no run","pushed back hard at the bowler, who stops it cleanly"
6.3,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run",nudged softly into the leg side
6.2,"Jadeja to Iyer, no run","some grip in the surface! Shreyas is setting himself to play to leg, but he's squared up by one that holds up in the surface"
6.1,"Jadeja to Munro, 1 run","Munro doesn't look in control as he flashes at a straight one, the ball coming off the inside half of the bat and rolling into space on the leg side"
5.6,"Harbhajan to Munro, 1 run","thumped down to long off, Harbhajan copping a stinging blow to the finger as the ball passes him, and a single ends the Powerplay"
5.5,"Harbhajan to Iyer, 1 run","flicked off the pads, and into the leg side for one"
5.4,"Harbhajan to Munro, 1 run","Munro stays deep in his crease, tapping a single out to long off"
5.3,"Harbhajan to Iyer, 1 run","and he's off the mark straight away with a gentle push wide of long on. Shreyas wants two, but Munro says no"
5.2,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, OUT","Dhoni juggles, but holds it at the second attempt! Dhawan tried to manufacture a glide to third man, but the ball just bounced a little more than he expected. The bounce also took Dhoni by surprise, but he manages to cling on to a juggling effort"
5.1,"Harbhajan to Munro, 1 run","some grip and spin, but Munro's back and across to nurdle into the leg side"
4.6,"Chahar to Munro, 1 run","shorter, but slow at only 116km/h, Munro pulling just wide of mid on for a single"
4.5,"Chahar to Munro, no run","pushed down the leg side, but the umpire reckons it's clipped Munro's thigh and doesn't give a wide. Munro disagrees. Vehemently"
4.4,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","held back by Chahar at just over 122km/h, Dhawan turning the strike over with a push to cover"
4.3,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run","bouncing over leg stump! Dhawan catches a lucky break after he walks down at Chahar and bottom edges a pokey shot back towards his stumps, the ball just evading the timber"
4.2,"Chahar to Munro, 1 run","Chahar comes around the stumps, but Munro uses the angle to work a single into the gap in front of midwicket"
4.1,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","very full outside off, and Dhawan squeezes a drive out to deep point"
3.6,"Harbhajan to Munro, no run","Harbhajan finds some grip outside off, Munro pinging cover with a drive"
3.5,"Harbhajan to Munro, 2 runs","top edged! Munro's in a rush, and turns into a reverse sweep, top-edging the effort over short third man"
3.4,"Harbhajan to Munro, no run","that's better! Flighted up outside off, and Munro loses his shape in an ungainly swipe to leg"
3.3,"Harbhajan to Munro, FOUR runs","crunched through cover! Too short, and the ball just sat up outside off. It's a slow track, and his length was all wrong"
3.2,"Harbhajan to Munro, no run","round the stumps comes Harbhajan, Munro tapping softly to cover"
3.1,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run","looped up full, just outside off, and Dhawan turns the strike over with a drive to long off"
2.6,"Chahar to Munro, no run","slower ball to finish, and Munro is slightly wrong-footed on his attempted dab to third man, ball beating bat"
2.5,"Chahar to Munro, FOUR runs","slammed back down the ground! Munro danced out at him, getting to the pitch and holding nothing back as he swatted the ball back down the ground, past the bowler and along the turf"
2.4,"Chahar to Munro, no run","pushed across him, on a length and outside off, and Munro misses a booming drive"
2.3,"Chahar to Shaw, OUT","Prithvi pulls, but misses, and he's struck on the thigh. It looks high, the umpire's call is not out, but they ask for a review. He's not the tallest, though, and the ball wasn't climbing too much. But it's three reds, and the decision is over-turned! Excellent review there"
2.2,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","back of a length, in the channel, but Dhawan rides the bounce well and cracks a single out to that deep point fielder"
2.1,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run","rising outside off with some inviting width, but Dhawan cuts over the top of it, bottom edging the ball hard into the turf"
1.6,"Thakur to S Dhawan, 1 run","good follow-up, Dhawan dead-batting to cover for a tip-and-run single to keep the strike"
1.5,"Thakur to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","pulled through square leg now, the bowler switching his length up and Dhawan waiting deep in the crease expectantly. The timing and placement are spot on"
1.4,"Thakur to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","and again! This one is straighter, and even sweeter off the blade. Thakur's seam position is excellent, but it's too full and Dhawan is forward to meet it in full flow"
1.3,"Thakur to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","full, in the slot, and it's slammed down the ground. Thakur's searching for swing, but there's none to be had"
1.2,"Thakur to S Dhawan, no run","down the track charges Dhawan, but he flashes under the ball and hits only fresh air"
1.1,"Thakur to S Dhawan, no run","accurate start, with a touch of wobble on off stump. Dhawan props forward to push to mid off"
0.6,"Chahar to Shaw, FOUR runs","there's that pull shot! This wasn't all that short, but Prithvi hops back quickly into position and nails a pull in front of square, and into the gap"
0.5,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","bottom edged again, the ball ricocheting off the bat and just past the stumps, and they pinch a single before the keeper's up"
0.4,"Chahar to Shaw, 1 run","and he opens his account with a bottom-edged hack that bounces into space in front of cover point. Quick hands, but the connection wasn't great"
0.3,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","full, and it's driven, but again he picks out cover perfectly"
0.2,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","Prithvi is up on his tip-toes to crunch a back of a length delivery to cover, Chahar pulling his length back a touch. But he can't quite thread the gap"
0.1,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","that's better, pitching the ball up to Shaw and finding some curve away from the bat. But it's met with a good stride forward and a punch into the covers"
0.1,"Chahar to Shaw, 1 wide","Chahar steams in, but pulls out of the delivery as he gets to the crease, holding onto the ball, and when he delivers the second attempt, he sprays it down the leg side. Nerves?"
19.5,"Ahmed to Paul, FOUR runs","short ball, and he has sent this through Vijay Shankar's reach at midwicket for four! Delhi have just about held their nerve. What should have been a canter at one stage, has turned into an absolute humdinger, but Delhi make the date for Qualifier 2 against Chennai Super Kings!"
19.4,"Ahmed to Mishra, OUT","length ball, and he misses it. It goes through to Saha, and Mishra runs across for the run. They have asked for a review, because the throw didn't hit the stumps. Did he obstruct the field, though? There's no outside edge on it. The ball went through to Saha, who had a shy at the stumps. Oh, was the call for caught-behind? In which case, it's not out, obviously. So Sunrisers lose their review. They have a look at this again. Mishra does change his angle a bit towards the ball. Could it be obstructed the field then? Has the ball hit Mishra? It has, and this out! What an Eliminator this is turning out to be. Do Delhi want to win this or not?"
19.3,"Ahmed to Paul, 1 run","slower ball, outside off, and he has whipped this towards midwicket. They want two, but will have to make do with one!"
19.2,"Ahmed to Paul, no run","short ball, angles away from him, and he can't get to it"
19.1,"Ahmed to Mishra, 1 run","slower ball, and he angles this across him from around the wicket, and Mishra gets it down towards third man"
19.1,"Ahmed to Mishra, 1 wide","slower ball, outside off, and it has been called wide. That was close, and Mishra did choose to not play a shot"
18.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Paul, no run","length, angles away, and he misses out with a tentative poke"
18.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, OUT","full ball, and he has gone for a one-handed shot, and spliced this up. Pant is gone! Kumar floated this away outside off again, and Pant went for the glory shot, just like Rutherford. And he's picked up by Nabi, just like Rutherford. Surely, they cannot lose this from here?"
18.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, no run","length, and he plays this back towards Bhuvneshwar. The bowler goes down, and seems to have twisted his right ankle. Hopefully, nothing serious "
18.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, 1 wide","very short ball, and he looks to ramp this over third man. Called wide, because he couldn't reach this"
18.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, SIX runs","length, and he has gone high, and handsome. Over long off. There you go -- the first six this IPL through the off side"
18.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, no run","length, angles across Pant, who plays this towards point"
18.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rutherford, OUT","length ball, outside off, slower ball, and Rutherford's hand has come off the handle. It hangs in the air, and Nabi tracks this from long off, and holds on! Is there a twist yet?"
17.6,"Basil to Rutherford, 1 run","length, and he looks to run it down to third man. Inside edge takes it to short fine leg, and slow enough for them to go through for a quick single"
17.5,"Basil to Pant, 1 run","full ball, and he drives this down to long on"
17.4,"Basil to Pant, SIX runs","length, and he has gone down the ground towards midwicket again. Guess how many "
17.3,"Basil to Pant, FOUR runs","length, and he has whipped this off his pads towards long leg. Terrific shot again from Pant!"
17.2,"Basil to Pant, SIX runs","length, and he goes over midwicket. HUGE SIX!"
17.1,"Basil to Pant, FOUR runs","length ball, and he has gone straight back down the ground past Thampi. Couple of bounces, and through for four past long off"
16.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Rutherford, no run","length, angles across him, and he looks to go over midwicket, but goes way over the ball. No contact made"
16.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rutherford, SIX runs","length, wide, and he has smashed this right back down the ground, way over long off. We know he's capable of this. The length was right in the slot "
16.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, 1 run","length, wide outside off, and he bangs this towards backward point"
16.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rutherford, 1 run","short, outside off, and he bangs this away towards deep midwicket"
16.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rutherford, no run","short, knuckle ball, and he lobs it towards point. No run!"

15.5,"M Nabi to Pant, SIX runs","length, and he sits down and swings this around to long leg. Rashid is there, but he just cannot get across to it"
15.4,"M Nabi to Rutherford, 1 run","length, and he plays this towards point. Pant runs through for a quick single. Panic stations setting in for Delhi here?"
15.3,"M Nabi to Rutherford, no run","turns from a length, and gets the inside edge, and nearly bounces on to the stumps"
15.2,"M Nabi to Rutherford, no run","length, and turns away, and Rutherford is just about able to get his body behind it"
15.1,"M Nabi to Pant, 1 run","short, and he goes back and plays this away towards long leg"
14.6,"Rashid Khan to Rutherford, no run","leg break, did it take the edge, as it trickled towards short fine leg? Never mind, it has fallen short. They have disturbed the stumps at the striker's end, but Rutherford was back!"
14.5,"Rashid Khan to Rutherford, no run","leg break, that beats an attempted heave down the pitch. Rutherford didn't read it"
14.4,"Rashid Khan to Axar Patel, OUT","turns back into him, takes the inside edge and trickles off his body, and Saha claims this! What a catch, and another wicket for Sunrisers Hyderabad. Rashid Khan turning it on when his team needs it! Bowling quick, and getting some purchase from the surface. This is turning into a great period for the former champions, as they are putting the squeeze on this young batting lineup. Replays reveal it has hit the pad, though. They don't have a review though"
14.3,"Rashid Khan to Axar Patel, no run","tossed up, googly, angles across, and beats the outstretched forward defensive. Great bowling, Rashid!"
14.2,"Rashid Khan to Axar Patel, no run","tossed up, and he drives and gets the inner edge, as it runs towards fine leg. Not far from the leg stump"
14.1,"Rashid Khan to Munro, OUT","length, turns back into him, and it's given out leg before. Munro was going across the line, and he has asked for a review! Rashid seems to have done the job, as there is no visible inside edge. Straightened after pitching just on middle, and would go on to hit leg. Another wicket lost, and so is the review!"
13.6,"Basil to Munro, 1 run","slower, short ball, and he rolls his wrist to get this towards deep backward square leg"
13.5,"Basil to Munro, SIX runs","down the leg side, and he has flicked this deep into the long leg fence. What a super piece of timing this from Munro!"
13.4,"Basil to Munro, no run","comes down the wicket again, and misses the line of a length ball, bowled at 122.5kph by Thampi"
13.3,"Basil to Munro, no run","slower ball, outside off, and he looks to go over midwicket and misses out completely"
13.2,"Basil to Munro, FOUR runs","comes down the wicket and tries to take him on down the ground. Gets an inner edge and it runs down to fine leg, just beyond the reach of Saha"
13.1,"Basil to Pant, 1 run","angles into him from around the wicket, and he runs this down to long on"
12.6,"Rashid Khan to Munro, no run","tossed up, angles away, and this time he defends"
12.5,"Rashid Khan to Pant, 1 run","full ball, and he sweeps it off leg stump towards long leg"
12.4,"Rashid Khan to Munro, 1 run","length, and he taps it towards short midwicket, and then has to rush through for the run as he responds to Pant's call. Rashid gets to it and throws at the striker's end"
12.3,"Rashid Khan to Munro, no run","turns back sharply into him as he plays from the crease. Strikes the pads, but probably going down leg"
12.2,"Rashid Khan to Munro, no run","length, and he plays this back towards Rashid"
12.1,"Rashid Khan to Munro, no run","angles away from him, and beats the outside edge. Googly, not picked"

11.5,"M Nabi to Pant, 1 run","length, and he dabs this towards cover"
11.4,"M Nabi to Pant, SIX runs","length, and he flogs this straight over long on. It's gone back a long, long way!"
11.3,"M Nabi to Munro, 1 run","length, outside off, and he drives it with the outside part of his bat towards point. They go through for a quick single"
11.2,"M Nabi to Pant, 1 run",presses forward and punches a length ball towards midwicket
11.1,"M Nabi to Pant, no run","length ball, and he plays it towards short leg"
10.6,"Ahmed to Shaw, OUT","caught at point! Khaleel's making a second phone call. Big wicket. Back of a length, pacier one at 141 kph, and Shaw is too late into the pull. Gets a top edge that loops to point, and suddenly this chase has come alive."
10.5,"Ahmed to Pant, 1 run","straighter, and he works it off his pads a tad awkwardly to fine leg"
10.4,"Ahmed to Shaw, 1 run",pulls this slower one to midwicket
10.3,"Ahmed to Pant, 1 run","good length on the fourth stump line, he stays in his crease and glides it to third man"
10.2,"Ahmed to Iyer, OUT","got him! Khaleel has got the breakthrough. Good length in the corridor, and Iyer wanted to glide it to third man, it bounced a bit more than he expected, took a thin edge through to Saha. Weird little celebration by Khaleel, gesturing making a phone call. Perhaps he's saying you've been called back?"
10.1,"Ahmed to Shaw, 1 run","back of a length, angling across, Shaw pulls but there is a deep square leg"
9.6,"Basil to Shaw, 1 bye",backs away and wanted to thwack that through extra cover but misses it. Just outside off so it misses the stumps too. Bounces awkwardly in front of Saha and off his pads for a bye
9.5,"Basil to Shaw, 2 runs","moves across and clips this off his pads, places it well enough to beat short fine leg and get a couple"
9.4,"Basil to Iyer, 1 run","good length, keeping it stump to stump, slower ball this time. He moves behind it and punches to long on with a straight bat"
9.3,"Basil to Iyer, no run","good length outside off, stands tall and punches to cover"
9.2,"Basil to Shaw, 1 run","back of a length, outside off, a bit more pace on that perhaps and he is a little late on the pull in front of square, ends up pulling to long on"

8.6,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, 1 run","tossed up, ends up as a low full toss, driven to long-on"
8.5,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, no run",defended back
8.4,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, FOUR runs","shot. too short and spinning away, Iyer goes deep in his crease and opens his bat face to cut it past point and into the fence"
8.3,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, no run","good length, pitching on middle and spinning across, he moves across too and taps it into the leg side"
8.2,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, no run","tossed up, dipping on him outside off, he mis-times the drive back to the bowler"
8.1,"Rashid Khan to Shaw, 1 run","back of a length, pitches on off and spinning away, he stays back and bunts to long-off"
8.1,"Rashid Khan to Shaw, 1 wide","googly goes wrong, pitches outside leg and turns further away. Wide"
7.6,"Hooda to Shaw, 1 run",walks across and taps this to midwicket to raise a fine fifty. He's come back into the runs in style
7.5,"Hooda to Shaw, 2 runs","Rashid to the rescue at deep point again. Ran to his left from deep cover, and slid to save the boundary. Shaw had cut this powerfully"
7.4,"Hooda to Iyer, 1 run","fetches this from outside off to paddle it fine, first ball"
7.4,"Hooda to S Dhawan, 1 wide, OUT","brilliant work by Saha. Dhawan gave him the charge and Hooda spotted that and smartly bowled it down leg. Saha had to move well to his right to collect and then come back to whip the bails off, which he does before Dhawan can ground his bat. It'll be a wide, but the important thing is, they've broken the opening stand"
7.3,"Hooda to Shaw, 1 run","Hooda shortens his length after that last ball, Shaw stays in his crease and cuts it away to deep cover"
7.2,"Hooda to Shaw, SIX runs","down the track and over the boundary. Shaw is in the mood tonight. Was skipping down quickly, got to the pitch and smashed it over long-on"
7.1,"Hooda to S Dhawan, 1 run","floated up full and on the stumps, nudged into the legside for a quick single"
6.6,"Basil to Shaw, no run","finishes with a bouncer, and Shaw is a little late in trying to ramp it over the keeper, and doesn't connect"
6.5,"Basil to Shaw, no run","good length, and close to off, but he's timing it so well, he's punched it from there to point by opening the face. There's a fielder there, who jumps up to field"
6.4,"Basil to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length outside off, steered to third man"
6.3,"Basil to S Dhawan, no run","slower ball, angling into him from around the wicket, Dhawan was looking to drive, adjusts and pats it back"
6.2,"Basil to S Dhawan, no run","back of a length outside off, cuts it nicely but straight to point"
6.1,"Basil to Shaw, 1 run","back of a length outside off, cuts it nicely to deep point, but the Powerplay is over, so there's protection there"
5.6,"Rashid Khan to Shaw, 1 run","googly again, stays back and turns it towards midwicket"
5.5,"Rashid Khan to Shaw, FOUR runs","oh my word, that's some shot. Doesn't care that it's Rashid, doesn't care that his googly and leggie is difficult to read. Spots that this is the leggie in fact and it's a touch fuller, smacks it over extra cover with a full-blooded swing"
5.4,"Rashid Khan to S Dhawan, 1 run","length ball on the stumps, and Dhawan paddles it fine"
5.3,"Rashid Khan to S Dhawan, no run","legspinner this time, but closer to off stump, so Dhawan perhaps thought it was another googly. ends up inside edging onto pad"
5.2,"Rashid Khan to S Dhawan, no run","googly and it beats him. A bit short and Dhawan set himself up to pull, but it turned the other way"
5.1,"Rashid Khan to S Dhawan, no run","full ball on the stumps, flicked to short midwicket"
4.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, no run","full, angling in, and flicked away nicely, but this time straight to short midwicket"
4.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, no run","and the pressure tells, he's strayed down leg side. Escapes the wide because it clips the pads with Shaw trying to get another four to fine leg"
4.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, FOUR runs",disdain. Length ball outside off and he cross bats it over mid-off as if it's a net session
4.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, SIX runs","oh ho ho ho, this young kid is schooling his senior India team-mate Short ball outside off and he upper-cuts it for six over third man. Fielder there, but he was just left standing"
4.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, FOUR runs","magnificent. Textbook cover drive to a full ball in the slot. Brings his bat down from high, shows the makers name, and sends it screaming along the ground"
4.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, 1 wide",down the legside and he will have to rebowl that
4.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, 2 runs","smacked towards the midwicket boundary but Rashid Khan hares along and dives to save runs. Too short, and he picked it up early and nicely, pulled in front of square"
3.6,"M Nabi to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","innovation and class. Brings out the reverse sweep, times and places it to perfection, past slip, past the man in the circle and to the third man fence"
3.5,"M Nabi to Shaw, 1 run","flatter on the stumps, he goes back and whips this to midwicket"
3.4,"M Nabi to Shaw, no run","beaten, straighter one and he was playing inside line"
3.3,"M Nabi to Shaw, no run",
3.2,"M Nabi to Shaw, 2 runs","dropped by Thampi at mid-off! that should have been taken. Shaw chipped this in the air and Thampi had to hold it low to his left, but he tumbled and lost balance, as well as the ball"
3.1,"M Nabi to Shaw, no run","length ball turning into him, chopped to point"
2.6,"Ahmed to Shaw, 1 run","back of length on the stumps again and he swivels to pull, but it's a touch quicker so he doesn't time it all that well and deep square leg fields"
2.5,"Ahmed to Shaw, FOUR runs","smashed. Khaleel's short ones were getting hit, so he goes full this time outside off, and Shaw just pummels it through cover for another four"
2.4,"Ahmed to Shaw, no run","wanted to go for the pull again, but misses"
2.3,"Ahmed to Shaw, FOUR runs","shot! Fully in control of this pull shot. The last one had gone slightly lower on the bat, this is right off the middle. Goes deep in his crease and goes bang to the midwicket boundary"
2.2,"Ahmed to Shaw, FOUR runs","that's a much more confident shot. Back of a length and doesn't rise as much, he spots it and transfers weight back, pulls it to the long-on boundary"
2.1,"Ahmed to Shaw, no run","bouncer first up and Shaw is late on the pull, as it flies past him. Nicely done by the bowler"
1.6,"M Nabi to S Dhawan, no run","flatter and skiddier, Dhawan punches to cover"
1.5,"M Nabi to Shaw, 1 run","tossed up on off, and squirted past cover off an outside edge. He was looking to go a lot straighter"
1.4,"M Nabi to Shaw, no run","floated up, stump to stump, patted back to the bowler"
1.3,"M Nabi to S Dhawan, 1 run","flatter and darting in closer to off stump, Dhawan opens the face and steers to point's right"
1.2,"M Nabi to S Dhawan, no run","given some more air and that turned more from a length, chopped to point"
1.1,"M Nabi to S Dhawan, no run","good length, not much turn away from him. Slapped to cover"
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, no run","short, and he plays it away towards midwicket"
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to S Dhawan, 1 run","fuller length, pushed into the offside for a single"
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",bad ball and that's punished. Good length on the pads and all he needs to do is time his flick - and Dhawan's timing in the second half this IPL has been sublime. He moves across and flicks to the square leg boundary
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","crunched. Dhawan's making the new ball count. He's in super form and it shows, not that far outside off, but he punches this through cover. Wasn't that short, wasn't that wide, but he just got his timing perfect."
0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, 1 run","short, outside off, and he loses a bit of shape as he looks to play this towards mid on. Gets it away to square leg"
0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaw, no run","length, angles into him, and he defends this towards mid on"
19.6,"Paul to Basil, 1 run","slower ball, and he swings this hard, and it goes off the toe-end towards short third man"
19.5,"Paul to Rashid Khan, OUT","slower ball, and he looks to go towards midwicket, but gets an edge, through to Pant behind  the wicket"
19.5,"Paul to Hooda, 1 wide, OUT","slower ball, outside off, and they have tried to go for a single. There's a throw at the non-striker's end. The batsman collided with the bowler. They are conferring about whether Shreyas Iyer wants to withdraw the appeal. The umpires. Iyer, Rishabh Pant everybody in there. And eventually Delhi want the appeal to stand. Paul was looking to go for the ball, and in the process his leg stuck out a bit as Hooda was getting to the non-striker's end. It was also called a wide, by the way"
19.4,"Paul to M Nabi, OUT","slower ball, and he looks to go towards point, but hasn't been able to clear backward point! He has been having trouble picking up Paul's slower ball, and this was another off-cutter just wide of off stump, and he went for the right choice of shot, but sliced it as he tried to go towards the backward point fence"
19.3,"Paul to M Nabi, no run","full, wide of off stump, and he misses out on contact as he looks to run it towards point"
19.3,"Paul to M Nabi, (no ball) SIX runs","no-ball, and he has driven this straight down the ground over long on! Too much of a length ball, but he overstepped to begin with. Free hit now!"
19.2,"Paul to M Nabi, no run","slower ball, outside off, and Nabi tries to go big over covers. Misses"
19.1,"Paul to Hooda, 1 run","yorker, and he biffs this away towards long leg"
19.1,"Paul to Hooda, 1 wide","slower ball, wide of off stump, and called wide, as it goes beyond the tramlines"

18.5,"Boult to Hooda, no run","yorker, and he keeps it out, playing it back to Boult"
18.5,"Boult to Hooda, 1 wide","full, wide of off stump, and he tries to reach it but can't. Called wide, as it went just beyond the tramlines"
18.4,"Boult to Hooda, 2 runs","yorker, and he flicks this away towards Shaw, who has a fumble at long leg, and that allows them to come back for the second"
18.3,"Boult to Shankar, OUT","length, and he goes across the line this time, and holes out to deep midwicket! Vijay Shankar is filthy with himself, because that was again a ball that could have gone for four or six, but instead gives Delhi a wicket"
18.2,"Boult to Shankar, SIX runs","length, wide of off stump, and he goes inside out again. Shreyas Iyer gets to it, but cannot hold on. Tried to get it back in, with Shikhar Dhawan near him, but it still lands beyond the boundary!"
18.1,"Boult to Shankar, FOUR runs","Boult is greeted with an inside-out shot, over extra cover, and almost all the way for six!"
17.6,"Paul to Shankar, 1 run","full, and he crashes this down the ground to long off"
17.5,"Paul to Shankar, FOUR runs","short, and he has got a hold of this, putting it beyond the reach of long leg. Uses the pace of the ball effectively"

17.2,"Paul to M Nabi, FOUR runs","full, in the slot, and he biffs this straight back over the bowler's head. Couple of bounces, and through for four, between long off and long on"
17.1,"Paul to M Nabi, no run","full ball, outside off, and Nabi looks to go big down the ground, but misses out on contact"
16.6,"Axar Patel to Shankar, SIX runs","length, and he has lofted this over midwicket. Terrific timing from Vijay Shankar, as Patel's four overs come to an end"
16.5,"Axar Patel to M Nabi, 1 run","short, and he swings this away towards long leg"
16.4,"Axar Patel to M Nabi, no run","length, played towards point. Shankar runs almost halfway down the wicket, but is sent back. There's no throw anyway"
16.3,"Axar Patel to M Nabi, no run",blocks a length ball on off stump
16.2,"Axar Patel to M Nabi, FOUR runs","length, and he plays it fine towards third man. Just waited for it to come to him, and ran it down past short third man. May have been a bit more of an edge than he intended, but the intent was there"
16.1,"Axar Patel to Shankar, 1 run","length, and he hits this hard back down the ground. Beats Patel, but there's protection in the shape of long off"
15.6,"Sharma to M Nabi, FOUR runs","length ball, some width, and Nabi cuts this past point. Superb bit of timing, as it gave Munro no chance to cut it off!"
15.5,"Sharma to Williamson, OUT","yorker, and pegged to perfection! Williamson backs away to create some room and go through the off side, but is beaten by both the pace and length of it. Tails back in sharply and hits the base of off stump. Williamson goes, and could prove to be a good thing for Sunrisers, as he looked physically a bit less than 100 percent"
15.4,"Sharma to Williamson, FOUR runs","slower ball, and he has got a hold of this, whipping it in the air towards deep backward square leg. Boult dives to his right, in going for the catch, but it lands just ahead of him, and goes through for four"
15.3,"Sharma to Shankar, 1 leg bye","slower ball, comes into him, and he tries to flick this. Comes into him and hits his pads"

15.1,"Sharma to Shankar, 1 run","starts with a slower ball, at the pads, and he flicks it towards long leg"
14.6,"Rutherford to Williamson, 2 runs","goes for the lap shot, and it takes the top edge and skews towards third man. Just beyond the reach of Amit Mishra at short third man. Was looking to go over fine leg, but the slow pace of the ball forced the mistake. Lucky to survive!"
14.5,"Rutherford to Williamson, no run","slower ball, comes back into him, and he drops it at his feet. Too close to him to consider going for a run"
14.4,"Rutherford to Williamson, 2 runs","length, cuts back into him, and he drops it with soft hands. They go for the quick single, and Rutherford tries to kick the stumps down, but he misses. They will pick up an overthrow, as it completely wrong-footed Pant behind the stumps!"
14.3,"Rutherford to Williamson, FOUR runs","slower ball, wide of off stump, and Williamson waits on it and gets it in front of square with a drive"
14.3,"Rutherford to Williamson, 1 wide","short, and goes down the leg side. Will have to re-bowl this. Quite a few wides bowled already in this innings"

13.4,"Paul to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball, outside off, and he drives this towards backward point"
13.3,"Paul to Pandey, OUT","slower ball, and he looks to flick this, but hasn't timed it all. It goes towards long on, where Rutherford doesn't need to move a muscle as it comes straight into his midriff. Foxed by the change of pace, and Pandey is put out of his misery, just when he was probably beginning to find his bearings"
13.2,"Paul to Williamson, 1 run","full ball, and he scoops it away towards backward point"
13.1,"Paul to Pandey, 1 run","length ball, and he drives this towards cover, where Prithvi Shaw dives to his left, and quickly releases it to the non-striker's end. Doesn't hit, though"

11.6,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","length, and he goes back and punches this to sweeper cover"
11.5,"Axar Patel to Pandey, 1 run","short, and he goes back to pull this. Somehow muscles it past Dhawan at short midwicket, but again, not off the middle of the bat"
11.4,"Axar Patel to Pandey, no run","short, and he goes back to cut this but misses the ball"
11.3,"Axar Patel to Pandey, FOUR runs","short, and he goes back and cuts this beyond point. Placed well to the right of short third man. Uses the pace of the ball from Patel effectively"
11.2,"Axar Patel to Pandey, no run","tossed up, outside off, and he goes for the big drive. Bails whipped off, and they go upstairs to check for the stumping! Seems to be ok, as the back leg seems planted inside when Pant effected the stumping. Given not out"
11.1,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","tossed up, and he drives this towards cover"
10.6,"Mishra to Pandey, no run","tossed up again, turns away from him, and he plays it towards point with the turn"

10.3,"Mishra to Williamson, no run","length, and holds up again, just beats the outside of the bat, possibly a slight edge, as Pant drops it!"

9.4,"Axar Patel to Williamson, no run","gets this to bounce a bit more off a length, but Williamson has gone deep in his crease so he's able to pat it down from waist high"
9.3,"Axar Patel to Pandey, 1 run",gives himself room and pushes towards mid-off
9.2,"Axar Patel to Pandey, no run","slightly shorter, spinning away from middle and Pandey wants to slap it away, but can't go past cover"

8.2,"Mishra to Pandey, no run","good length outside off, slapped to point"
8.1,"Mishra to Pandey, 2 runs","tossed up on the stumps and he brings out the sweep, but plays it along the ground. Got nicely on top of it. Keemo runs to his left at the midwicket boundary, tumbles and saves."
7.6,"Paul to Williamson, no run","slower ball again, Williamson waits for it and punches, but short cover fields"
7.6,"Paul to Williamson, 1 wide",Keemo needs to get his line sorted. Another one well down leg side and another wide
7.5,"Paul to Pandey, 1 leg bye","big appeal for lbw, not given. They don't take the review. Fuller length, tailing into him, but he had moved a little bit and though it hit his pads with Pandey missing the punch, it would have gone down leg"
7.4,"Paul to Williamson, 1 run","gets it to move off the seam, but ends up on the pads and Williamson tucks it to fine leg"
7.3,"Paul to Williamson, no run","pace off the ball, full one outside off, Williamson pushes it towards mid-off. That was just 106 kph"

6.5,"Mishra to Pandey, 1 run","stays back and slashes this past point, too short and wide enough to play the shot. There's protection in the deep though"
6.4,"Mishra to Pandey, no run","nicely flighted and dipping on him, he wants to work it away but gets a leading edge that bounces to the bowler's right, in front of mid-on. Well in front"
6.3,"Mishra to Guptill, OUT","caught at deep midwicket. That's huge wicket, because Guptill was looking ominous. Very full on middle, in the slot to slog-sweep, which is exactly what Guptill does. Makes decent connection too, but that is the long part of the boundary and there is a man there, who runs to his left and pouches it safely."
6.2,"Mishra to Pandey, 1 run","given some more air and pitched fuller, Pandey was clearing his front leg, but it hurried on to him. Bunted to midwicket"
6.1,"Mishra to Guptill, 1 run","back of a length on off, and some gentle turn, Guptill punches to mid-off"
5.6,"Sharma to Pandey, no run","back of a length outside off, slower one. He waits for it and whips to midwicket, where Dhawan swoops down on the ball and has a shy at the stumps because they were thinking of a run, but misses."
5.5,"Sharma to Pandey, FOUR runs","top edge goes to fine leg He's bowled a bouncer, but without protection in the deep. Pandey knows that, and he goes for the hook. Gets a top edge but since there's no fielder, he gets a boundary. Landed centimetres inside the rope, so it's just four"
5.4,"Sharma to Guptill, 1 run","back of a length, coming into him and cramps Guptill for room, who was backing away. He jabs it towards point for a quick single"
5.3,"Sharma to Pandey, 1 run","slower ball again, he waits for it and clips it to mid-on for a quick single"
5.2,"Sharma to Pandey, no run","good length on the stumps, steered to point"
5.1,"Sharma to Pandey, FOUR runs","misfield goes for four. Length ball outside off, driven on the up, and Shreyas Iyer at mid-off was going to his left. Wanted to pick it up and throw it back quickly for a possible run out, ends up missing it and the ball goes for four"
4.6,"Axar Patel to Guptill, no run","good length, going with the angle, he misses the flick and it hits him high on the pad. Going down leg"
4.5,"Axar Patel to Guptill, SIX runs","wham. Guptill is in the mood today. Axar dragged it short, perhaps expecting Guptill to step out. The batsman stayed put, rocked back and pulled it powerfully over deep square leg"
4.4,"Axar Patel to Pandey, 1 run","skips down the track, gets to the pitch of the ball and strokes it past extra cover"
4.3,"Axar Patel to Pandey, no run","gives himself room and cuts this from in front of the stumps, but can't get past point"
4.2,"Axar Patel to Pandey, no run","fuller length on middle, he defends towards cover off the front foot"
4.1,"Axar Patel to Pandey, no run","darting in on a length, pushed towards point"
3.6,"Sharma to Guptill, no run","was backing away to give himself room to have a thrash at it, but Ishant follows him with one that is nipping back in. Guptill ends up pushing it towards silly mid-on and thinks about a single, but is sent back"
3.5,"Sharma to Guptill, no run","good comeback, almost yorker length on middle and off and Guptill drives it back to the bowler"
3.4,"Sharma to Guptill, FOUR runs","that's a free gift, straying on the pads and all Guptill had to do was get a bit of bat on it. Tickles it fine and collects the boundary"
3.3,"Sharma to Pandey, 1 run","almost yorker length and Pandey pats it back to Ishant, who parries it away to mid-on and they get a single"
3.2,"Sharma to Guptill, 1 run","slower ball, it's the knuckle ball he's been practising perhaps? Held on the pitch and Guptill was too early into the tuck, gets a thick leading edge that floats past the bowler. Not near enough to attempt a catch"
3.1,"Sharma to Saha, OUT","taken at mid-off. Saha has been going hard in the Powerplay and he wanted to continue that, but he mis-timed this horribly. Got it off the end of the bat, and instead of lofting it over extra cover, the ball looped to mid-off, where Shreyas Iyer backpedalled and caught it comfortably"
2.6,"Boult to Guptill, SIX runs","smashed. That's just disdainfully put away. Short and wide outside off, and Guptill thrashes his cut shot well over the point boundary. That was hit very hard"
2.5,"Boult to Guptill, SIX runs","he's spliced it for six!. Boult went wide outside off again and Guptill threw his hands at it, one hand ended up coming off the bat and the bat also turned in his hand, but he still got enough on it to loft it over the cover boundary"
2.4,"Boult to Guptill, no run","goes wider outside off that time and very full. In the driving range, but Guptill could only toe-end the drive to cover"
2.3,"Boult to Guptill, 2 runs","strays in line again, ends up on the pads and Guptill tucks it fine. Short fine leg has to run behind the ball to pull it in before it hits the boundary"
2.2,"Boult to Saha, 1 run","good length but on the pads, and he tucks it to square leg"
2.1,"Boult to Saha, no run","good length, angling across him, punched to point"
1.6,"Sharma to Guptill, no run","good response by the bowler, dug it in short and it was rising as it went past Guptill, who tried to uppercut it  staying legside of the ball. Misses it and it goes to the keeper"
1.5,"Sharma to Guptill, SIX runs","that's into the top tier. Guptill seemed to have pre-decided that this ball wasn't going to stay in the field. Length ball on the stumps he takes a step down and hits down the ground with a full, clean swing. Great connection and the ball's disappeared"
1.4,"Sharma to Saha, 1 run","length ball coming into him, Saha is on the move again, but flicks it off his pads to midwicket in the circle"
1.3,"Sharma to Saha, no run","through him. Length ball and Ishant gets it to bounce a bit due to his height. Saha is coming forward and has a poke at it, but it goes past his outside edge in the corridor"
1.2,"Sharma to Guptill, 1 run","fuller, on middle, Guptill drives from the crease and Shaw at cover mis-fields, allowing the single"
1.1,"Sharma to Guptill, no run","good length, in the corridor outside off, Guptill comes on the front foot to reach the pitch of the ball and defend to the offside"
0.6,"Boult to Saha, FOUR runs","shot!. Great timing from Saha, just punches this length ball between cover and point and it finds the boundary"
0.5,"Boult to Guptill, 1 run","very full outside off, almost yorker length, Guptill comes on the front foot and pushes it past the bowler. Another quick single"
0.4,"Boult to Saha, 1 run","good length on the stumps, steered to point. They take a quick single but there's a direct hit at the batsman's end by Amit Mishra. But he was wel lin"
0.3,"Boult to Guptill, 1 run","he's getting some shape into the right-hander but wrong line that time, strays on the pads and Guptill picks him off to deep square leg"
0.2,"Boult to Saha, 1 run","back of a length on the stumps, pushed towards short cover and they take a quick single"
0.1,"Boult to Saha, no run","he's given him first ball! And Saha goes for the review right as the DRS clock was running out. Back of a length, pitched on middle and came back into him. Looks like there was an inside edge too. Saha might not have felt that, because he waited for so long to take a review, and after a long discussion with Guptill. In any case, it looked a little high too. Rolled off the pad towards gully. Not out is the verdict, the right one. Bruce Oxenford was the umpire"
18.3,"Chahar to Yadav, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, pulled away to deep square and Mumbai enter their fifth IPL final"

16.4,"Bravo to Pandya, 2 runs","slower ball from Bravo, 99.9ks, full and outside off, Suryakumar slices a loft. Faf runs in from long-on, dives gingerly and can't get to the ball. It drops in front of him"

14.2,"Jadeja to Yadav, no run","slides on outside off, punched to the covers"
14.1,"Jadeja to Yadav, FOUR runs","Jadeja finds the outside edge but it eludes the reach of Watson. Okay, dropped it is.  Drifts in and turns away, poked away, Watson dives away to his left and goes with one hand but the ball pops out"
13.6,"Tahir to Krunal, OUT","Tahir appeals for caught and bowled. Umpire Llong calls for a review. The soft signal is out. Oh, Krunal is walking. Dipping full-toss on off, Krunal toe-ends it right back to Tahir. Krunal is off the field even before the TV umpire rules him out. Just like that, two in two for Tahir"
13.5,"Tahir to Ishan, OUT","skidder from Tahir, takes out the off stump. Tahir doesn't quite run like he often does, fairly subdued celebration. Kishan aims to pull it away to the leg side, but Tahir's quick for him"

13.1,"Tahir to Ishan, 4 wide","starts on middle and spins down the leg side, Kishan lets it go, away from the reach of Dhoni. Harbhajan runs back, dives belatedly, and scoops the ball back near the fine leg boundary"

18.1,"McClenaghan to Uthappa, no run","well, this is almost an identical delivery, but the umpire lets this one pass. And now Uthappa is the unhappy one"
18.1,"McClenaghan to Uthappa, 1 wide","and he pushes his first ball too far outside off, and it's called wide. McCleneghan reckons its a harsh call"
17.6,"Malinga to Uthappa, 1 run","very full once again, and Uthappa clubs it into the leg side for a single to keep the strike"
17.5,"Malinga to Uthappa, no run","Malinga continues around the stumps, angling a full one right across Uthappa, who flings his arms through a booming drive but can't put bat to ball. The struggle continues"
17.4,"Malinga to Uthappa, no run","nicely bowled, very full and Uthappa can only dig it out back to the bowler"
17.3,"Malinga to Uthappa, no run","fuller this time, and Uthappa swings past it as he looks to wallop this down the ground"
17.3,"Malinga to Uthappa, 1 wide",and this one is called wide for height now Malinga digging in a bouncer that balloons well over the batsman
17.3,"Malinga to Uthappa, 1 wide","Malinga loses his radar, and this one is called wide"
17.2,"Malinga to Rana, OUT","but now he's got to go! Rana was looking to smash everything, and he went very deep in the crease looking to smear this over long off. But the connection isn't enough to get the ball past Pollard, who trots in and holds a simple catch at long off"
17.1,"Malinga to Rana, SIX runs","swatted over cow corner! KKR need these runs so desperately. Rana fetches a length delivery cleanly into the leg side, the ball sailing well back into the crowd"
16.6,"Bumrah to Uthappa, SIX runs","down the ground! There was almost more height than distance on this as Uthappa slugged a full toss straight over Bumrah's head. Pollard is lurking at long on, and positions himself early, but the ball has just enough on it to beat him"
16.5,"Bumrah to Uthappa, no run","flung down well wide of off stump, wide of the popping crease, but it's not a wide as Uthappa had wandered in that direction too, missing an airy drive"
16.4,"Bumrah to Rana, 1 run","direct hit might have had him! Rana pushed this just to the left of Rohit in the cover, who swoops and shies, but it goes wide"
16.3,"Bumrah to Uthappa, 1 run","nicely bowled, Bumrah bustling in and delivering a waspish full ball aimed at the off stump. Uthappa does well to dig it out, and gets a single for his troubles"
16.2,"Bumrah to Rana, 1 run","Rana walks across to the off side, glancing off his pads and out to deep square for a single"
16.1,"Bumrah to Rana, no run","and he shoots one across Rana's bows, the left hander making some room but missing an attempted thrash into the off side"
15.6,"Malinga to Rana, 1 run","canny bowling, pace off the ball to finish the over, but Rana waits on it and dead-bats a quick single towards point"
15.5,"Malinga to Uthappa, 1 leg bye","Uthappa can't lay bat on this leg-stump yorker, but they pinch a single off his boot. There's a stifled appeal from Malinga, but it pitched outside leg"
15.4,"Malinga to Rana, 1 run","well bowled, right up to him at 137km/h, but Rana's execution is equally good as he waits deep in the crease and angles his blade to work the ball behind point for a single"
15.3,"Malinga to Uthappa, 1 run",
15.2,"Malinga to Rana, 1 run","Malinga switches to over the stumps for the left-hander, Rana slicing a low full toss outside off out to the cover sweeper, on the bounce"
15.1,"Malinga to Uthappa, 1 run","Malinga stays around the stumps, slinging down a very full ball that's dug out down the ground"
14.6,"Pandya to Uthappa, 1 run","a bottom-handed slog into the leg side bounces down to long on, it's just the single and he'll keep the strike"
14.5,"Pandya to Uthappa, no run","Hardik takes some pace off this full one, outside off, Uthappa setting himself for an almighty heave into the leg side but playing too early at it and missing yet another one. 48 dot balls in the innings so far"
14.4,"Pandya to Rana, 1 run","Hardik switches back to over the stumps, Rana shimmying into a leg glance. He doesn't get the best connection, but there's room enough for a quick single"
14.3,"Pandya to Rana, SIX runs","over third man this time! Rana is all over the place in the crease, backing away to leg. Hardik follows him with a short one, but Rana shows excellent awareness with third man up, ramping the ball up and over the fielder. And in fact, he's hit it so well that the ball carries all the way for six"
14.2,"Pandya to Rana, 2 runs","this one is a little more agricultural, Rana backing away to leg and hacking a full one over the covers. They hurry back for a second"
14.1,"Pandya to Rana, SIX runs","lifted elegantly over long off! The ball was in the slot, a long half volley just outside off, but Rana also struck it really well, holding his shape and letting the right elbow lead the shot"
13.6,"Bumrah to Uthappa, SIX runs","picked up into the stands! Uthappa is moving around a lot in the crease, and he goes really deep to this short ball, using the pace and the angle to lift it into the stands beyond deep backward square leg for a vital boundary"
13.5,"Bumrah to Uthappa, FOUR runs","runs, finally! Uthappa backs away to leg and slashes a length ball behind point, beating third man on his right"
13.4,"Bumrah to Uthappa, no run",
13.3,"Bumrah to Uthappa, no run","another dot, Bumrah bending his back on a 137km/h bouncer that lifts rapidly past Uthappa's attempted pull shot, thudding into de Kock's gloves"
13.2,"Bumrah to Uthappa, no run","he backs away to leg but Bumrah follows him, the ball jagging in off the track to beat a whip into the leg side and strike him on the thigh"
13.1,"Bumrah to Uthappa, no run","Bumrah's back, and he starts with a gem of a delivery just outside off that bursts off the track and past Uthappa's outside edge - yet another play-and-miss"
12.6,"Malinga to Rana, no run","another short one at just under 135km/h, and Rana does manage to drop his hands under this one as it fizzes through to de Kock"
12.5,"Malinga to Russell, OUT","there's an appeal, and it's given! Russell falls to the very first legitimate delivery he faces, and what was clearly a plan from Malinga has worked. He targeted Russell with another bumper from around the stumps, but this one was bang on target. Russell found himself in an awkward position, and he could neither get out of the way nor drop his hands quickly enough, the ball brushing the gloves on the way through to the keeper"
12.5,"Malinga to Russell, 1 wide","dug in by Lasith, but it's misdirected down the leg side"
12.4,"Malinga to Karthik, OUT","a leaping Krunal snaffles one! Malinga slung another full one in towards the pads, Karthik looking to flick him to midwicket but neither keeping it along the turf nor getting any real elevation in the shot. Krunal is in position at midwicket, inside the circle, and he times his leap just right to pluck the ball out of the air"
12.3,"Malinga to Karthik, no run","Karthik looks to glance off his legs, but the ball zips in to hit him on the pad. It pitched well outside leg, Malinga continuing around the stumps"
12.2,"Malinga to Uthappa, 1 run","and he looks for the same again, but the ball takes a thick inside edge onto the pad and rolls to short fine for a single"
12.1,"Malinga to Uthappa, SIX runs","sweet relief! Robbie has finally got hold of one, smiting a full slower ball over long on for a pressure-relieving six"
11.6,"Krunal to Uthappa, 1 run",pushed down to long off for an ambled single that keeps him the strike
11.5,"Krunal to Uthappa, no run","left alone outside off! Krunal pushes this through slightly wider of off stump, and Uthappa just lets it past"
11.4,"Krunal to Uthappa, no run","Robbie looks for a big biff over the leg side, but the ball rushes on to him, beating the bat and hitting the pad"
11.3,"Krunal to Karthik, 1 run","flicked off the toes into the leg side, just the one"
11.2,"Krunal to Uthappa, 1 run","another dot, and it's a full toss too, dipping in towards off stump to be driven down to long off"
11.1,"Krunal to Karthik, 1 run","Krunal darts in a low full toss from around the stumps, but Karthik can't make much of it, sweeping out to deep backward square"
10.6,"McClenaghan to Uthappa, no run",it's a maiden as Uthappa looks to run another one down and is beaten yet again outside off. There's a touch of panic starting to set in  
10.5,"McClenaghan to Uthappa, no run","five! Uthappa has really been backed into a corner here. Another gentle length delivery, in the corridor, but he looks to hit it rather too hard and touches only fresh air"
10.4,"McClenaghan to Uthappa, no run","four in a row! Uthappa sets himself for an uppercut at a slow, short cutter at 121km/h, but it's another play and a miss"
10.3,"McClenaghan to Uthappa, no run","cracked hard to mid off, but Pollard is in that position and there's no run to be had. Another dot"
10.2,"McClenaghan to Uthappa, no run","and now he's down the track, looking to thump another cutter at under 125km/h through the covers, but failing to put bat to ball"
10.1,"McClenaghan to Uthappa, no run","Uthappa looks to run a length ball down to third man, but he's beaten on the outside edge. McCleneghan took the pace off that one"
9.6,"Krunal to Uthappa, 1 run","length outside off, opens the face and runs it to short third"
9.5,"Krunal to Karthik, 1 run","full on off, driven out to long-off"
9.4,"Krunal to Karthik, no run",length and down leg side. Sweeps viciously at this. It skids off the face and finds short fine who is really fine
9.3,"Krunal to Karthik, no run","full on off stump, driven with the turn to extra cover"
9.3,"Krunal to Karthik, 1 wide","length ball down leg side, past the attempted flick"
9.2,"Krunal to Uthappa, 1 run",arm ball at a length on leg stump. Tickles it to short fine's right
9.1,"Krunal to Uthappa, no run","length on leg stump, tossed up. Leans in and flicks to midwicket"
8.6,"Pandya to Karthik, no run","length on off stump, defended on the front foot to point"
8.5,"Pandya to Karthik, no run","past the edge. Slams one in the corridor, just short of a length. Karthik defends inside the line as this fizzes past"
8.4,"Pandya to Uthappa, 1 run","short of a length outside off, late cut down to third man"
8.3,"Pandya to Uthappa, no run","length on off stump, defended to point"
8.2,"Pandya to Lynn, OUT",taken by QDK! Yet another slower ball from Hardik to get a KKR opener. This dips at a length outside off. He makes room and has an ugly heave at it. Not anywhere close to the ball and gets a top edge that QDK has to go backwards to gather. He does it with some comfort. The wheels have come off for KKR
8.1,"Pandya to Uthappa, 1 run","slower short ball wide outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
7.6,"Krunal to Lynn, no run","length at middle stump, hurriedly pushed to midwicket"
7.5,"Krunal to Uthappa, 1 run","length and angled at leg stump. Plants the front leg across for the ramp, but he won't get it past the inner circle. Off the glove and keeper cleans up"
7.4,"Krunal to Lynn, 1 run","length outside off, looks to muscle this and loses his timing. Down to long-on off the inside half"
7.3,"Krunal to Uthappa, 1 run","length at middle stump, gets deep in the crease and punches to sweeper cover"
7.2,"Krunal to Lynn, 1 run","full and wide outside off, makes room, drives to sweeper cover"
7.1,"Krunal to Lynn, no run","yorker at leg stump, can't do more than push that down the pitch"
6.6,"Pandya to Uthappa, no run",short and wide outside off. Looks to cut and is beaten
6.5,"Pandya to Lynn, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut straight to sweeper cover"
6.4,"Pandya to Lynn, no run",inside edge as he looks to cut this short ball outside off. Past the stumps and rolls out towards short fine
6.3,"Pandya to Uthappa, 1 run","length outside off, leans in, opens the face and gets it down to third man"
6.2,"Pandya to Uthappa, no run","short of a length just outside off, looks to play the cut, beaten by the extra bounce"
6.1,"Pandya to Gill, OUT",that looks plumb. It's given. And Lynn tells Gill that's not worth the review. Hardik starts with a slower ball that floats up full and at middle stump. Gill doesn't pick and is beaten as he looks to flick this. Caught dead in front of middle
5.6,"Chahar to Lynn, no run","length on leg stump, flicked to square leg"
5.5,"Chahar to Lynn, no run","short of a length at middle stump, makes room and taps into the covers"
5.4,"Chahar to Lynn, SIX runs","makes room and goes inside-out! What quick hands. And what powerful ones. Full on middle stump, exposes the stumps and drills it over the wide long-off region"
5.3,"Chahar to Lynn, no run","length, skidding through again. Looks to go the same way but gets this attempted loft off the inside half and it trickles back harmlessly to the bowler"
5.2,"Chahar to Lynn, SIX runs","straight over the bowler. Length ball skids on at off stump, not a lot of turn on that. Clears the front leg and slams through the line to clear the sight screen"
5.1,"Chahar to Lynn, no run","short of a length outside off, cut into the off side"
4.6,"Bumrah to Gill, no run",length and slanted in at off stump. Cramped on the drive. Can only get it into the off side with no timing
4.5,"Bumrah to Gill, no run",length in the corridor defended into the off side
4.4,"Bumrah to Gill, no run","full at off stump, opens the face and drives to cover point off the toe-end"
4.3,"Bumrah to Lynn, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, backs away and slaps it on the rise to Pollard at mid-off. It's quick and Pollard fumbles"
4.3,"Bumrah to Lynn, (no ball) FOUR runs",slipped out of his hand and chopped over point. It's an attempted offcutter and it ends up a juicy full toss at chest height with lots of width
4.2,"Bumrah to Lynn, 2 runs",mistimed drive and Pollard can sprint behind this from mid-off and keep it in. Full toss outside off and it came off the toe-end. Looked like he was a little too eager to get that away
4.1,"Bumrah to Gill, 1 run","length on off stump, gets on the back foot and drops this into the off side with soft hands"
3.6,"Malinga to Lynn, no run","full slower ball on off stump, tapped into the covers"
3.5,"Malinga to Lynn, SIX runs","clears the long leg boundary! Lynn slightly off balance at the second consecutive short ball, but he's held his shape in the end and lifted this from his chest off the top edge of the bat"
3.4,"Malinga to Lynn, no run","short ball slanted across the corridor, arches back to let it go"
3.3,"Malinga to Lynn, FOUR runs","smokes it between point and cover. Whew. Gets his shoulders into this and no one moves. Slower ball, skidding on from a length with a lot of width. He chops at it so hard. What power."
3.2,"Malinga to Gill, 1 run","length on middle stump, flicked to long-on"
3.1,"Malinga to Gill, 2 runs","length on leg stump, flicked to deep square's right"
2.6,"McClenaghan to Lynn, SIX runs",connects! Slower ball at a length on leg stump. Clears the front leg and slogs with the full flow to get it over the midwicket boundary
2.5,"McClenaghan to Gill, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length on middle stump. Pulled off the front foot but Krunal cleans up to his right at deep square"
2.4,"McClenaghan to Lynn, 1 leg bye","full slower ball on leg stump this time. Looks to slug it into the leg side, gets a deflection off the pad into the off"
2.3,"McClenaghan to Gill, 1 run","full slower ball outside off, looks to slog this and gets a thick inside edge towards deep square"

0.4,"McClenaghan to Gill, no run","length on leg stump, flicked to midwicket's right"
0.3,"McClenaghan to Lynn, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven sweetly to extra cover's right. He dives and parries it towards mid-off"
0.2,"McClenaghan to Lynn, no run","huge appeal from Mitch for lbw. Full ball catches Lynn in front of leg stump. Rohit says no bat to Mitch as they consider the review. He is wrong, that is a big edge. It's also pitched outside leg. They don't end up taking the review though, so it's all good in the end. Lynn just jabbing at this in front of the body"
0.1,"McClenaghan to Gill, 1 run","length at off stump, defended into the off side"
17.6,"Tahir to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","crunched down the ground! That's it! It was tossed up, he threw his hands through the line and hit it flat down the ground for the winning runs."
17.5,"Tahir to Mandeep, 1 run","good length leg break, he's back and forcing this to long on"

16.3,"Jadeja to Sam Curran, no run","good length outside off, he's back and defending"
16.2,"Jadeja to Pooran, OUT","caught behind! Great catch from Dhoni. It was fired short and wide at speed, Pooran flashed at a cut shot, he got quite a healthy deflection and Dhoni's gloves swallowed it."
16.1,"Jadeja to Mandeep, 1 run","darted into leg stump, he's back and pushing this firmly to long on"
15.6,"Tahir to Pooran, no run","pushed through outside off, he late cuts with fast hands straight to short third man"

15.4,"Tahir to Pooran, 1 run","loopy full toss, he drives to long off"
15.3,"Tahir to Pooran, SIX runs","launched over deep midwicket! My goodness! This was hit so far! Another short ball, he hung back and clobbered it into the stands"
15.2,"Tahir to Pooran, 4 byes","pushed through, yorker length, beats the bat and the keeper! A rare mistake from Dhoni. It was very full and the flashing blade was a problem and it went straight through"

14.6,"Jadeja to Mandeep, 2 runs","fired quick and flat on leg, he pulls through square leg and gets a couple"

14.2,"Jadeja to Pooran, no run","fired shorter wide of off, he chops a bottom edge"
14.1,"Jadeja to Pooran, SIX runs",launched over square leg! Pooran didn't hold back. It was in his hitting arc and he went with the spin over square leg. That's a huge hit
13.6,"Bravo to Mandeep, 2 runs","full on leg, he clips this neatly wide of long on and they sprint back for two"
13.5,"Bravo to Pooran, 1 run","full length, wide of off, he drives elegantly to deep cover-point"
13.4,"Bravo to Pooran, FOUR runs",this is cracked through cover! Overpitched and he climbs into a powerful cover-drive beating the man on the ring
13.3,"Bravo to Pooran, no run","dropped at point by Murali Vijay! Just came on, and Pooran slices a square drive straight to him and he grasses it. It was a hot chance"
13.2,"Bravo to Pooran, 4 runs","he overpitches, this is driven to long off, they take on the throw for a second, Bravo doesn't field the throw at the non-striker's and they get two over throws! Worse still Jadhav hurt his shoulder saving the overthrows near the boundary! They nearly got six"
13.1,"Bravo to Mandeep, 1 run","slower ball full toss, surprised him a touch but he glanced it fine for a single"
12.6,"Harbhajan to Pooran, SIX runs","pounded over midwicket! This was too short, Pooran was back in a flash, opening up his hips and smashing a pull shot way back into the stands at deep midwicket"

12.3,"Harbhajan to Mandeep, 1 run","flatter on off, he's back and forcing this towards long on"
12.2,"Harbhajan to Agarwal, OUT","caught at deep backward square! This was a short drag down, Agarwal was back and pulling this high behind square but he picked out Jadeja! He hit it straight to him. Could have hit that anywhere. Harbhajan has three"

10.4,"Harbhajan to Gayle, OUT","Two in two! Holed out to long on! Game has changed. This was a half tracker, Gayle sat back and tried to smoke this over long on, he got it off the toe of the bat and hit it flat straight down the substitute's throat. Sixth time Harbhajan gets Gayle!"
10.3,"Harbhajan to Rahul, OUT","skied to cover! Finally a mistake. Rahul had been flawless until now. He tossed this up and it just dropped on Rahul late as he ran down and tried to loft over long on, he got a leading edge and skied it straight up to cover, Tahir had to sit under it for awhile but he held on"
10.2,"Harbhajan to Gayle, 1 run","darted into leg, he clips this easily forward of square to the man in the deep"

9.1,"Bravo to Gayle, 1 wide","angles across a length ball, and squirts it too wide of the tramlines"
8.6,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR runs","full ball, outside off, and he has muscled this towards long off. They are checking to see if it is four or six definitely bounced just ahead of the boundary skirting"
8.5,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR runs","length ball, and he waits for it and whips this away towards deep midwicket. Sheer power, and placement!"
8.4,"Chahar to Gayle, 1 run","length, and he punches this back down towards long on"
8.3,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","slower ball, angles across him, and he leaves"
8.2,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","full ball, and he drives this down to long on"
8.1,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","full ball, he drives this back hard and it hits the stumps at the non-striker's end. Didn't take Chahar's fingers along the way, and then the bowler jokingly holds on to Gayle's right leg"
7.6,"Bravo to Rahul, 1 run","full ball, but down the pads, and he whips this away towards long leg. The fine leg fielder goes away to his left and keeps the scoring down"
7.5,"Bravo to Gayle, 1 run","length, and he taps it away towards cover to pick up a single"
7.4,"Bravo to Rahul, 1 run","full ball, straight, and he whips this away wide of long on. There should have been an easy two, but Universe Boss wants the strike, and turns down the second "

7.2,"Bravo to Gayle, 1 run","full, wide and he gets enough bat to swat it away towards cover and sets off immediately for a single"
7.1,"Bravo to Rahul, 1 run","length ball, and he whips it off his pads towards deep midwicket"
6.6,"Tahir to Gayle, SIX runs","length, and this time he goes with the turn. Don't look for that, this has sailed high over long on"
6.5,"Tahir to Gayle, SIX runs","tossed up, outside off, and he has struck this hard, and high. Over long off for six!"
6.4,"Tahir to Gayle, FOUR runs","full toss, and he eases into a drive through cover. Beats the man inside the inner ring, and then goes through for four"
6.3,"Tahir to Gayle, no run","length ball, goes back and looks to flog this through midwicket. It turns enough to beat the inside edge, and strikes his pad. Would have gone down leg"

4.5,"Chahar to Rahul, 2 runs","length, and he lofts this towards deep midwicket. The man in the deep has to run across to his left and stop this from crossing the ropes"
4.4,"Chahar to Gayle, 1 run","length, and he plays this towards cover and rushes through for a quick single. Almost runs into the umpire, and then has a bit of bi-play with him"

2.6,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","short, angles across him, and he lets it pass"
2.5,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","slower, short ball, and it takes ages to arrive at Gayle, who plays a defensive shot towards point. That went at 116kph, and may have been a knuckle ball"
2.4,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","short, angles into him, he gets up on his toes and whips this towards deep midwicket"
2.3,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR runs","short, and down leg side, and he swings this away and beats short fine leg. Always four once it beat that man in the inner ring"

1.3,"Harbhajan to Gayle, 1 leg bye","length, down the leg side, and he looks for a glance. It runs towards short fine leg off his pads, and there could have been overthrows, but Gayle had gone too far at the non-striker's end"
1.2,"Harbhajan to Gayle, no run","tossed up, and he he drives this to short cover"
1.1,"Harbhajan to Gayle, FOUR runs","short ball, and he goes back and works this towards long leg. Comfortable put away and Harbhajan should know this is a slow pitch, with little turn"
0.6,"Chahar to Rahul, SIX runs","short, and he rocks back and sends this a few rows back into the midwicket fence! Emphatic"
0.5,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","full ball, on the pads, and he plays a defensive shot towards short midwicket. Was a shot for the taking, but he has made a cautious, cagey start here"

19.2,"Shami to Rayudu, OUT","caught at deep square midwicket! This was in the slot on leg stump, he heaved it away but didn't nail it, he dragged it square and flat to Mandeep in the deep and he held the catch well."

18.4,"Sam Curran to du Plessis, OUT","bowled him! What a yorker! This was brilliant. He speared a yorker into the feet of du Plessis, he tried to get his feet out of the way, it came off the pads onto the stumps and Faf ended up on all fours! What a great innings though. Out for 96"

10.4,"Ashwin to du Plessis, no run",play and miss attempting to sweep. Pooran takes the bails off and appeals. It's been sent up to the TV umpire Bruce Oxenford . Faf's back foot is grounded at all times. He's safe
10.3,"Ashwin to du Plessis, FOUR runs",skips down and delightfully lofts this straight at the sightscreen! Superb stroke!. Beautiful footwork and he just eased it through the line. It just half-volleyed into the foam triangle. Inches from a six.

9.2,"Tye to du Plessis, FOUR runs","length, and width outside off, and he flays this through the extra cover region. May have meant it as a slower ball, but du Plessis picked it early"

7.2,"Ashwin to Raina, 1 run","length, and he punches this straight ball down towards long on"
7.1,"Ashwin to Raina, FOUR runs","seems like a seam-up ball outside off, and Raina runs it down towards third man. Smart shot, keeps it wide of Gayle at first slip"

6.5,"Harpreet Brar to Raina, 1 run","fuller ball, and he flicks this towards midwicket and picks up a quick single"
6.4,"Harpreet Brar to Raina, SIX runs","uses his feet to get to the pitch of the ball, and goes over long on. Not hit off the middle, but good enough from Raina"

4.1,"Sam Curran to Watson, OUT","got him!

Strikes the top of off, and gives Kings XI Punjab the much-needed breakthrough in the Powerplay"

0.5,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, no run","flatter, straighter one that darts back at him, and he is able to get some bat on to it. Close!"
0.4,"Harpreet Brar to du Plessis, 1 run","flighted, on middle, and he flicks this towards midwicket"

19.1,"M Nabi to Yadav, FOUR runs","slaps it to the point boundary! For all the silence he evoked with that 28-run over, Umesh has the crowd delirious right now. What a shot. Full and flat and wide from Nabi and he times this perfectly to get it past point"

18.3,"Ahmed to Sundar, OUT","taken at mid-off! Oh you're kidding me! The Chinnaswamy crowd must have seen more twists in this stage of a game than anyone else. Sundar with to be honest, an utterly pathetic shot. Slower short of a length ball outside off. He shuffles, presumably to pull. But ends up jabbing at it, well in front of his body. Chipped straight over the bowler and Pandey hangs on"
18.3,"Ahmed to Sundar, 1 wide","yorker, wide outside off. Looks to chop, beaten"
18.2,"Ahmed to Gurkeerat, OUT","straight to point! Slower short ball outside off from around the wicket. He looks to chop this over point but he finds Yusuf Pathan who - finally - finds the ball. Gurkeerat and Hetmyer have both departed after bringing it till here. Is there something in this still for SRH? We'll see. But for now - what a super knock. And all things considered, a statement, from Gurkeerat. He's an experienced domestic player. Even played for India once, remember. He's played a lovely, calm knock today"

17.4,"Rashid Khan to Hetmyer, OUT","taken at long-off. Shankar stretches up and holds on to it in front of the SRH dugout. Hetmyer is livid with himself. He lost control of that shot. Short ball, googly, spinning away outside off. He wanted to cut firmly but that got big on him and he had to check his shot. It's commentary on the size of this ground that this shot was taken narrowly inside play because he didn't time that too well. But what a fantastic innings. Stunning, as he always is when he spends any amount of decent time in the middle"
17.3,"Rashid Khan to Hetmyer, SIX runs","pulled over long-on! Short ball in at middle stump from around the wicket. Uses the angle, uses the depth in the crease and, most importantly, the poor length. Drills it"

17.1,"Rashid Khan to Gurkeerat, SIX runs","slapped over deep square! They just haven't let Rashid settle down. Googly, short at leg stump. Gets back in the crease and gets it flat to the fielder's left"

16.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Gurkeerat, no run",nicely directed bouncer. Up at the left shoulder. Looks to hook and is beaten

16.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Gurkeerat, 1 leg bye","short of a length on leg stump, looks to flick and cops it on the thigh"
15.6,"Shankar to Gurkeerat, 1 run","misfield again. Length outside off, sliced straight to Pandey at point and he doesn't gather cleanly"
15.5,"Shankar to Gurkeerat, FOUR runs","pings off deep square leg and into the boundary. Bhuvneshwar wants this ball to get higher as it dips awkwardly at him. It skids on off his calves and climbs over the rope. A pull from Gurkeerat, picked up from middle stump"
15.4,"Shankar to Gurkeerat, FOUR runs",oh that is superbly done. Gurkeerat summons all the composure he's shown so far to get one past point to bring up his fifty. Full outside off and he opened the face and caressed it to the fielder's right

5.1,"Sharma to Lomror, FOUR runs","opens the face and glides it fine of third man! Probably got it finer than intended but it was nicely played, opening the face and using the pace and angle"

4.3,"Axar Patel to Gopal, no run","fuller outside off, he pushes on the front foot to point"

17.6,"Sam Curran to Karthik, FOUR runs",seals the win with two overs to spare! Full and into the pads. Stays still and whips at it. Looks like a slight inside edge onto pad before it sprints to the fine boundary

17.4,"Sam Curran to Karthik, 2 runs","short and wide outside off, cut to third man's right"
17.4,"Sam Curran to Karthik, 1 wide","bouncer just outside off, left alone"
17.3,"Sam Curran to Karthik, FOUR runs","off the outside edge but there might have been intent to do exactly that from Karthik. Yorker length just outside off, jams the bat down on it and past the keeper"

14.5,"Shami to Russell, OUT",taken at deep square!  Short and into the body once again. Russell finally connects on the pull. But it's not ideal connection. Slices it. Big ground. And he won't clear it
14.4,"Shami to Russell, no run",short and in at the body. Backs away for the cut and is beaten
14.3,"Shami to Russell, FOUR runs",whack. A word invented precisely for when this man stretches his arms at a length ball wide outside off. Fizzes past extra cover

14.1,"Shami to Gill, 1 run","length at leg stump, nudged down to fine leg with the angle"
13.6,"Tye to Russell, SIX runs","dropped! And he might have tipped it into the boundary padding too! Mayank at long-off. Full ball outside off, gets low and drills it flat. He's inside by quite a bit and gets his hands on this, but it floats and lands on the padding. Oh boy"
13.5,"Tye to Russell, no run",bouncer at an off stump line. Ducks under it
13.4,"Tye to Russell, no run",full and wide outside off. Chucks his hands at this and is beaten
13.4,"Tye to Russell, 1 wide",bouncer. Dug in too short. Left alone
13.3,"Tye to Russell, SIX runs","see ya! Here we go. Attempted yorker turns into a full toss on leg stump. Russell gets the front leg into the leg side, about a yard. Then he carts this over midwicket, about a billion yards"
13.3,"Tye to Russell, 1 wide",short and down leg side. Russell jumps into the off side to let it go
13.2,"Tye to Russell, 2 runs",full and in at leg stump. Backs away and slogs. Off the inside part of the toe-end. Long-on cleans up to his right

12.6,"Ashwin to Gill, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked into the midwicket region"
12.5,"Ashwin to Gill, FOUR runs",fifty. Silken late cut. Short of a length and wide outside off. Waits on it and just chops it to short third's right
12.5,"Ashwin to Gill, 1 wide","very wide. Once again, tries to switch his run-up. Loses control of it entirely"
12.4,"Ashwin to Gill, no run","length outside off, under-edged poke into the off side"
12.3,"Ashwin to Gill, SIX runs",clears deep backward square! Poor ball. Stopped in his run up and bowled a length ball down leg side. Gill gets on one knee and sweeps deliberately over
12.2,"Ashwin to Gill, no run","length outside off, chopped to extra cover's left"
12.1,"Ashwin to Gill, SIX runs","sweeeet. That Gill elegance. Down the pitch, not to the pitch of the ball, but he has long levers. Stretches his arms and hits through the line to lift this over long-on"
11.6,"Sam Curran to Russell, no run",appeal for catch behind but not out. Short and very wide outside off. Looks for that big chop through point again but is beaten
11.5,"Sam Curran to Russell, no run",short.  And just under the head. Makes Russell duck
11.4,"Sam Curran to Russell, FOUR runs","slower ball, dropped very short. Sits up nicely and he spreads his arms to slaughter this. Into the point boundary"
11.3,"Sam Curran to Gill, 1 run","length and wide outside off, chopped to sweeper's left"
11.2,"Sam Curran to Russell, 1 run",slower ball at leg stump. Looks to offer the full face and defend. Gets an inside edge to the keeper's left. Throw goes in at the non-striker's end and misses as Russell is ambling in

10.5,"Ashwin to Gill, no run","full and just outside off, driven straight to extra cover"
10.4,"Ashwin to Russell, 1 run",full carrom ball at middle stump. Defended off the outside half of the bat and through the extra cover fielder. Ashwin can't believe it
10.3,"Ashwin to Uthappa, OUT","picks out long-off accurately. Uthappa checks his shot and is taken about ten yards inside the fence. Length ball cutting away in the corridor. Has room, makes more. But for some reason, doesn't swing hard through the line. Lobs it to Agarwal"
10.2,"Ashwin to Gill, 1 run",length and following the batsman down leg. Backs away and punches to long-off
10.1,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
9.6,"Sam Curran to Gill, 2 runs","short, and he whips this away towards deep midwicket. Rahul fumbles a touch and that allows them to come back for two"

9.4,"Sam Curran to Gill, no run","length, and he punches it to R Ashwin at extra cover"
9.3,"Sam Curran to Gill, FOUR runs","length, and he punches this. Terrific placement again, and it gives mid off no chance"
9.2,"Sam Curran to Uthappa, 1 run","slower ball, outside off, and he dabs this towards short third man and they go through for a comfortable single to Chris Gayle stationed there"
9.1,"Sam Curran to Gill, 1 run","angles into him, and he whips this off his pads towards backward square leg"

8.5,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","leg break, fired towards the pads, and he goes back and whips this away towards long leg"
8.4,"Ashwin to Uthappa, FOUR runs","length, zippy ball, and he goes back and plays a cut, very late, off the stumps virtually, and pierces the gap between point and short third man. Class!"
8.3,"Ashwin to Uthappa, SIX runs","uses his feet to get to a length ball, and lofts this straight over the bowler, and all the way for six over long off. Beautiful from Uthappa!"
8.2,"Ashwin to Uthappa, FOUR runs","tossed up, on the pads, and he hits this towards deep midwicket. The man at long on, KL Rahul, gets to it, and misfields. Oh dear. Gets nutmegged by the ball!"

6.4,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","length, and he goes back and eases this to the right of point"
6.3,"Ashwin to Gill, 1 run","tossed up, angled in, and he plays this with the tide towards deep midwicket"
6.2,"Ashwin to Gill, 2 runs","length, and he punches this towards sweeper cover. A half-stop at covers results in a deflection, and they can pick up two"
6.1,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","length, turns into him after pitching on leg, and he goes back and eases this towards deep midwicket"
5.6,"Tye to Lynn, OUT","short, and he has top-edged this. It goes up, and Tye picks up the return catch! Could this be a turning point of sorts? This over had already produced 15, but Lynn wanted to maximise the last ball of the Powerplay, and paid the price in the process"
5.5,"Tye to Lynn, FOUR runs","full ball, and he wants to go down the ground, but gets an inner edge, and it runs away towards fine leg for four"
5.4,"Tye to Lynn, SIX runs","short, and he has got this away towards long leg. Not off the middle, but good enough to carry over the fielder stationed at the fence there"

5.2,"Tye to Gill, no run","length ball, angles into him, and he defends this towards point"

4.5,"Ashwin to Lynn, no run","tosses this up outside off, and he looks to go down the ground. Outside edge again, and it flies off towards short third man, but lands short"
4.4,"Ashwin to Lynn, no run","fuller ball, and he gets an inside edge on to his boot. It lands short of the bowler"
4.3,"Ashwin to Lynn, SIX runs","backs away, and picks up a carrom ball and goes inside out. Powerful, as he sends it deep over long off"
4.2,"Ashwin to Lynn, no run","carrom ball, angles into his pads and he tries to drag this through the leg side, but cannot make contact"
4.1,"Ashwin to Lynn, FOUR runs","tosses this up outside off, and Lynn looks to go down the ground. Outside edge carries it past short third man"
3.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, 2 runs","full ball, and he plays another attractive straight drive. Misfield from mid on, and that allows the batsmen to come back for the second"
3.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Lynn, 1 leg bye","slower ball, and he was looking to go hard between midwicket and backward square leg, but missed on contact. A touch off his body takes it towards short third man"
3.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Lynn, FOUR runs","short ball, and he gets this away towards fine leg. Not off the middle, but enough to beat Nicholas Pooran behind the wicket, as he desperately dives away to his left"
3.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Lynn, FOUR runs","full ball, and drilled down the ground past mid off"
3.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Lynn, FOUR runs","raw power! Makes room, and blasts a length ball angled across him through covers. It was more brute force, but importantly found the gap between mid off and cover"
3.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Lynn, no run","fuller ball, and he looks to go down the ground. Gets an inside edge on to his leg, and it lands right at his feet"
2.6,"Shami to Gill, no run","short, and he slaps this hard back towards mid off, but it travels quickly to the Kings XI captain. No possibility of getting any runs here"
2.5,"Shami to Lynn, 1 run","fuller ball, and he punches this hard down the ground. It bounces off the ground over Shami, but R Ashwin does well at mid off to get across to stop it and keep it down to one"
2.4,"Shami to Gill, 1 run","length ball, and he presses forward to punch this towards midwicket. Plays it gently enough to pick up a single"
2.3,"Shami to Gill, FOUR runs","length, angles into him, and he plays a sumptuous drive through midwicket. Gorgeous shot as he eased it to the left of midwicket, and to the right of the man at mid on"
2.2,"Shami to Gill, no run","full ball, and Gill digs it out, but cannot beat M Ashwin at point"
2.1,"Shami to Lynn, 1 run","length, a bit of width, and he slashes this away towards backward point"
1.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Lynn, 1 run","length, and he plays an uppish drive wide of R Ashwin at mid off. Easy single to retain strike"
1.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Lynn, SIX runs","down the wicket, and whacks this over midwicket. Well struck! Seemed to have pre-meditated it a touch, and Arshdeep fed him the short ball he was anticipating. Not fast enough, I'm afraid "
1.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Lynn, 2 runs","length, straight, and he plays this towards square leg, and immediately calls Gill through for two. Excellent running!"
1.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, 1 run","slower ball, angles across him, and he drives this towards mid on. A bit to the right of the fielder there, and that allows them to get through for a single"
1.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, no run","back of a length, angles across him at 135kph, and he punches this towards short cover"
1.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, no run","length, and he angles it across Gill, who defends"
0.6,"Shami to Lynn, no run","length, outside off, and he looks to drive, but hits it hard into the ground. Shami fields on his follow-through"
0.5,"Shami to Lynn, no run","length, swings into him, and he gets behind the line to defend"
0.4,"Shami to Gill, 1 run","length, jags into him, and he looks to flick this. Gets an inside edge on to the pads, which stops Shami mid-appeal, and it runs away towards square leg"
0.3,"Shami to Lynn, 1 run","short, and he goes up on his toes and punches this towards sweeper cover, who is stationed by the fence"
0.2,"Shami to Gill, 1 run","short, and he cuts this hard, but it is stopped by Rahul at point, and with the help of M Ashwin, they keep the scoring down to just one"
0.1,"Shami to Gill, no run","length, outisde off, and he gets behind the line and defends this"
19.6,"Gurney to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","and finishes with four as well! Gurney has missed the yorker every time this over, but you've got to believe Curran has done that to him. He's basically made him bowl wherever he wants it. This is overpitched and at the stumps. He shuffles into the off side again and drags this to the long leg boundary"
19.5,"Gurney to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","fifty! There it is again, Curran's unreal calm and wisdom. He's so young, and so is his career, but he just seems to be in full control of these situations. Gets his weight into the off side, gets behind the line and ramps this full ball fine"
19.4,"Gurney to Sam Curran, SIX runs",91 metres! What. An. Innings. Slower ball from Gurney and overpitched again. Curran is all over him. Waits on it to loop down and spanks it far over the long-on boundary
19.3,"Gurney to Sam Curran, FOUR runs",crunched over extra cover! Gurney switches it up from a plan that seemed to be working. And he bowls an overpitched ball with a lot of width outside off. Curran camps in the crease and drills this on the bounce into the advertising boards
19.2,"Gurney to Sam Curran, 2 runs","full and wide outside off this time. Steps into the off side and looks to slog this. Off the thick inside edge to deep square's right. Comes back for the second, puts in a slide, and survives the run-out call"
19.1,"Gurney to Sam Curran, 2 runs","yorker, regular pace, at middle stump. Whips across this and gets it to deep square's right"
18.6,"Russell to Tye, no run",bouncer. Looks to hook but is too slow on it. Sails through to Karthik
18.5,"Russell to Sam Curran, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, looks to pull, gets it off the toe-end to long-on"
18.4,"Russell to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","smart again! Curran has figured batting out tonight, for sure. Now he stays deep in the crease, waits for the full one. It arrives and he's in position to club it over the bowler"
18.3,"Russell to Sam Curran, FOUR runs",oh smart. Expects the slower ball dug into the pitch. Walks into the off side - does it late. Russell can't adjust. His slower ball in the corridor is slapped to the fine leg boundary
18.2,"Russell to Tye, 1 leg bye","length at leg stump, looks to flick and gets a deflection to third man off the front pad"
18.1,"Russell to Ashwin, OUT",dragged on! Another offcutter does it for KKR. This is at a length outside off. Ashwin splits his legs and looks to carve this but the under-edge gets it into the stumps
17.6,"Gurney to Ashwin, 1 leg bye","length and in at leg stump. Looks to flick, cops it on the back leg and gets a single pitch side on the off side"
17.5,"Gurney to Ashwin, no run","beaten on the pull. Slower ball, short and skidding into his body. Skids under his bat and clears the stumps"
17.4,"Gurney to Sam Curran, 1 run","full outside off, slugged down to long-on off the inside half"
17.3,"Gurney to Mandeep, OUT","held at extra cover. Gurney with the offcutter. Short of a length in the corridor. Makes room and tries to slap it over mid-off. Decent plan. But a better one from Gurney. No pace on it, gets it off the toe-end. Uthappa pedals backwards and takes it just past the edge of the circle"
17.2,"Gurney to Sam Curran, 1 run","slower short ball at middle stump, pulls into the floor, out to deep square"
17.1,"Gurney to Mandeep, 1 run","yorker at off stump, exposes his stumps and jams it through cover"
16.6,"Narine to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","to Rinku's left at long-on. Curran digs the dagger deeper. Length at middle, clears the front leg and heaves. One bounce and over the line as two fielders look to converge on it"
16.5,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked into the square leg region"
16.4,"Narine to Sam Curran, 1 run","dropped! Rinku Singh at long-on! He's been their best fielder this second half of the tournament but has put down a complete sitter. Full ball on middle stump, looks for the slog but this time it rips away quick. He slices it. rinku is under it, has time. But it pops out"
16.3,"Narine to Sam Curran, 2 runs","full on middle stump, driven inside-out, uppishly to long-off's right"
16.2,"Narine to Sam Curran, SIX runs",smokes it! Uffff that is proper connection. Stepped out and was nowhere near the pitch of this short of a length middle stump offbreak. Doesn't matter. Stays composed behind the line and swings it 93 metres in the direction of wide long-on
16.1,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run","length on leg stump, nudged to short fine's left"
15.6,"Russell to Sam Curran, no run","slower ball at leg stump, backs away to whip it. Taps it into the off stump because he's cramped"
15.5,"Russell to Sam Curran, no run","yorker at leg stump, jammed into the leg side"
15.4,"Russell to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","full and just outside off, stays still this time, allows it to arrive in his swinging zone and belts it past mid-off"
15.3,"Russell to Sam Curran, no run",bouncer. Follows him as he shuffles early and forces him to get out of the way
15.2,"Russell to Sam Curran, 2 runs","short of a length on off stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
15.1,"Russell to Mandeep, 1 run",short of a length and skidding on too quickly for him to get this pull away. Mistimed bunt into the leg side
14.6,"Chawla to Mandeep, 1 run","length on off stump, dropped into the covers with soft hands"
14.5,"Chawla to Mandeep, SIX runs",pulled over the bowler! Stunning shot. Short of a length and cramping him at the body. He gets deep in the crease but there's too much pace for him to go into the leg side with this. So he stays put and hammers it straight over Chawla
14.4,"Chawla to Sam Curran, 1 run","short of a length at off stump, pulled to long-on's left"
14.3,"Chawla to Sam Curran, no run","short of a length and skidding on at off stump. Backs away to pull, mistimes it down the pitch"

13.4,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked uppishly to deep midwicket's right"
13.3,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run, OUT","run out sent upstairs. Is that a direct hit? Mayank diving full length at the non-strikers. No it's not  direct hit, Narine's got his hands in a mess but he's got enough hand on the ball as it hits the stumps before his follow through takes the rest of it. Agarwal is gone. It was a full ball outside off, flicked between long-on and deep midwicket and the throw was right on top of the stumps. Agarwal has thrown away yet another IPL start"
13.2,"Narine to Agarwal, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
13.1,"Narine to Agarwal, no run",length and cramping him with turn into middle stump. Check-punch to extra cover

12.5,"Sandeep to Mandeep, 1 run","short of a length at middle stump, pulled to deep square"

11.1,"Chawla to Mandeep, 1 run","full on off stump, leans in and drives to long-off"
10.6,"Rana to Mandeep, 1 run","length on middle stump, allows it to skid on and punches to long-on"
10.5,"Rana to Pooran, OUT","golden arm Rana puts another one in his book! Oh boy. Short ball, proper log-hop at an off stump line. Gets deep in the crease and looks to pull this over midwicket. But for one, this ground has big square boundaries, and two, he's lost his shape as this comes on a little slower than he expects. Dragged straight to the fielder. What an ordinary end to a stunning innings"
10.4,"Rana to Pooran, no run","short and just outside off, cut straight to backward point"
10.3,"Rana to Agarwal, 1 run","length outside off, on one knee as he drags this to deep midwicket"
10.2,"Rana to Agarwal, SIX runs","shot! A clean, straight swing. He loves hitting spinners over their heads. Gets to the pitch of this and drills it straight from an off stump line"

9.6,"Chawla to Pooran, no run","wrong 'un, and he drives it back to the bowler"

9.3,"Chawla to Agarwal, 1 run","tosses this up, on the pads, and he flogs this down to long on"
9.2,"Chawla to Agarwal, FOUR runs","tossed up, and he has hammered this back over the bowler's head. Aerial, but a bounce before it hits the fence behind the bowler"

8.6,"Narine to Agarwal, 1 run","tossed up, and he pushes this down towards deep midwicket"
8.5,"Narine to Pooran, 1 run",presses forward and nudges a length ball towards square leg
8.4,"Narine to Pooran, no run","flatter, faster, and he looks to flick this ball on his pads, but it thuds into the pads before he brings his bat down"
8.3,"Narine to Pooran, 2 runs","length, turns across him, and he goes back and punches this towards deep midwicket. Perfect weight on it to force Narine to chase the ball, and still pick up two easily"

8.1,"Narine to Agarwal, 1 run","angles one into the pads, and he flicks it away towards long leg"
7.6,"Chawla to Agarwal, 1 run",goes back to punch the ball away towards square leg
7.5,"Chawla to Pooran, 1 run","goes back to cut a short ball, and it beats the man at point. Should have been a dot, but they get a single as the man misfields"
7.4,"Chawla to Pooran, FOUR runs","short, and he goes back and cuts this away towards backward point. Attempt by Rana to keep it in play after running around from sweeper cover, but it goes for four"

7.2,"Chawla to Pooran, 1 run","angles across him, and he plays this away towards backward point"

6.5,"Russell to Pooran, 1 wide","short, angles away from him, and he will have to re-bowl this. Pooran lets this pass"
6.4,"Russell to Pooran, FOUR runs","short, and he looks to hook this. Gets an under edge, that carries it to the left of Karthik, and it runs away for four through third man. Lucky!"

5.1,"Gurney to Agarwal, 2 runs","slower ball, outside off, and he plays a slightly airy shot through covers. The man at deep backward point will get around to it to limit the scoring to two"

4.5,"Sandeep to Pooran, FOUR runs","short, and this time he rocks back and swings this away towards deep midwicket"

Short ball, angles across him, and he looks to scoop this towards deep backward square leg, but that's where Shubman Gill is stationed, and he gleefully accepts this.

2.4,"Sandeep to Agarwal, FOUR runs","short, and he cuts this past point, and with third man inside the circle, that was always going to be four"
2.3,"Sandeep to Rahul, OUT","the first wicket comes through! Slower ball, straight, and Rahul looks to chip this through midwicket. Bails out at the last moment, and ends up going straight towards mid on. Chris Lynn, with a microphone on him as he speaks to the broadcasters, runs across over his right shoulder and takes a good catch"

0.4,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","length, outside off, and he plays this towards point. There's a shy at the striker's end as they go through for a quick single. A direct hit could have been interesting "

19.4,"Pandya to M Nabi, OUT","fuller and wider outside off, Nabi had to reach out for it, cannot get enough this time. Was a slower one as well and had Nabi let it go, it would have been a wide. But he ends up skying it towards long-off where Suryakumar settles under it"
19.3,"Pandya to M Nabi, SIX runs","a full toss but Nabi fails to middle it, or wait. He has still got enough on it to clear Pollard at long-on. Pollard jumps but the ball just evades him"

15.6,"Malinga to Pandey, FOUR runs","Malinga looks for a repeat but gets just little bit wrong. That's all Pandey needs as he hammers it past the stumps at the other end, gets to his fifty with the four, off 37 balls"
15.5,"Malinga to Pandey, no run","an excellent yorker, Pandey is standing on the leg stump and it was right at his toes, tailing in significantly. Pandey moves towards leg side and somehow manages to save his toes"

3.5,"Bumrah to Saha, FOUR runs","drama at the boundary's edge! Saha thwacked another pull into the leg side and Pollard thundered after it, trying to kick the ball back into play but succeeding only in pushing it into the boundary marker.

3.3,"Bhuvneshwar to de Kock, FOUR runs","pulled with authority! Quinny's just spent the summer scoring runs on the fast-bowling havens in South Africa, so this bouncer from Bhuvi doesn't have the wheels to intimidate him and he swivels back into a thumping pull"
3.2,"Bhuvneshwar to de Kock, FOUR runs","too straight, and all Quinny needs to do is beat the man at short fine leg to collect his first boundary. He does so with a neat, controlled glance"
3.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full, straight, and Rohit is forward to drive for a single"
2.6,"M Nabi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","darted in full at Rohit's legs, and he glances out to the man at deep midwicket to keep the strike"
2.5,"M Nabi to Rohit Sharma, no run","Rohit spots a little width, but his forcing stroke off the back foot is intercepted at cover"
2.4,"M Nabi to de Kock, 1 run","using the angle, de Kock flicks a single out to deep square leg"
2.3,"M Nabi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","tucked into the leg side, where Vijay Shankar swoops from midwicket and has a shy with one stump to aim at. It's an excellent throw, and a direct hit, but Rohit's bat is grounded behind the line before contact is made"
2.2,"M Nabi to de Kock, 1 run","de Kock backs away, looking to give himself room, and though Nabi follows him he can't stop a thump back down the track in his follow through"
2.1,"M Nabi to de Kock, no run","his first ball rushes on to de Kock, taking a thick inside edge of his poking defence"
1.6,"Ahmed to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","pulled, but it's in the air and not out of the middle. Fortunately for Rohit, the ball flies into space and goes safely to ground, bouncing out to deep midwicket where Nabi sets after it and dives near the boundary's edge, but touches the marker with his foot as he's hauling the ball back in to concede four more"
1.5,"Ahmed to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","width offered, and Rohit chops it firmly away behind point. There was a touch of toe-end to the shot, but it's placed wide of third man's right and brings four more"
1.4,"Ahmed to Rohit Sharma, no run","Khaleel pulls his length back a shade, and this one pings the cover fielder"
1.3,"Ahmed to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","crunched imperiously through extra cover! It's full, it's just wide enough to draw him into a cover drive, and he follows through fluently to send the ball scorching through the gap at cover for a third boundary"
1.2,"Ahmed to Rohit Sharma, no run","over the wicket comes Khaleel, and this time his line is spot on for the right-hander, Rohit pushing watchfully to point"
1.1,"Ahmed to de Kock, 1 run","his first delivery slips towards Quinny's legs, and he's milked down to fine leg to get off the mark"
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","uppish, but through the field! Rohit has every reason to trust this placid track, and so he's confident stepping forward and slashing through the line and on the up to send the ball flying through cover point"
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, no run","pitched right up and cutting in at 137km/h, and again Rohit defends. Bhuvi's seam position in this over has been exemplary"
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","whoops, this one goes awry, spilling too far outside off to open the extras column with a wide"
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, no run","shaping in from outside off, and Rohit leans forward and defends right under his eyes"
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, no run","punched firmly off the back foot once more, but he pings the cover field"
0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","misfield! Well, speaking of Thampi, this is a sloppy start from him in the field. Rohit slashes a rising delivery down to third man, and what should be a simple stop instead results in four runs as Thampi is slow creaking down to it and lets the ball past him"
0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, no run","Bhuvi's on target straight away, floating the ball up quite full and getting a touch of shape away from Rohit, who presses defensively to cover with half a step forward"
16.2,"Tahir to Mishra, OUT",is that an edge? Yes! Mishra leans in and pokes feebly at a ferocious legbreak outside off. Thin edge. Dhoni hangs on. Of course. And a massive win is sealed
16.1,"Tahir to Mishra, no run",length ball dipping in and ripping out. At a length outside off. Mishra fishes at it and is beaten
15.6,"Bravo to Mishra, 1 run","low full toss at off stump, backs away and chops it to point's right off the toe-end"
15.5,"Bravo to Boult, 1 run","yorker just outside off, takes his Steve Smith shuffle back into the crease, stays leg side of it and jams it down to long-on with purpose"
15.4,"Bravo to Mishra, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked to fine leg"
15.3,"Bravo to Mishra, FOUR runs","full toss on the thigh. Flicks to deep midwicket's right. Jadeja sprints and gets a hand on it, but can't recover quickly enough after crossing the line. The ball trickles into the boundary"
15.2,"Bravo to Suchith, OUT","length outside off, driven on the up to point. A mix-up and a direct hit.  Suchith was stumbling into the other end and he's short! Batsmen stranded in the middle of the pitch. Watson picks up, takes his time, hits the stumps at the non-striker's end on the bounce and that is the end of Suchith"
15.1,"Bravo to Suchith, no run",short of a length and pushed across the off stump. Slashes and misses
14.6,"Tahir to Suchith, 1 run","googly at a length on off stump, gets forward to defend to backward point's right"
14.5,"Tahir to Suchith, no run","full on middle stump, flicked to the bowler's left"

13.3,"Bravo to Suchith, no run","slower ball at a length outside off, punched on the up to extra cover"
13.2,"Bravo to Mishra, 1 run","slower yorker. Attempted one anyway. Mishra gingerly closes the face, meets it on the full and gets it out to deep square"
13.1,"Bravo to Suchith, 1 run","slower ball, length outside off. Slashes and gets a thick edge down to third man"
12.6,"Harbhajan to Mishra, no run","tossed up outside off, gets down to sweep, cops it on the body"
12.5,"Harbhajan to Mishra, no run",short of a length and jumping up at his gloves as he shapes to cut

12.1,"Harbhajan to Suchith, no run",big turn past the outside edge as this drifts in and draws him into the forward block
11.6,"Jadeja to Iyer, OUT","another stumping appeal. Length ball past the outside edge again as Iyer looks to defend this time. Lightning stumping as expected and the toe is up again! Oh you're kidding me! Ridiculous, ridiculous just filthy from Dhoni. He's playing on a different plane tonight. That toe wasn't up for a second even on slow-mo. Surreal skill to get the bails off that quickly."
11.5,"Jadeja to Suchith, 1 run","full outside off, driven firmly to sweeper's left"
11.4,"Jadeja to Morris, OUT",past the edge. Past the edge before he knew what had come. Ripping break away as he looks to defend with less than half a stride. And his back leg is up! Dhoni has stumped and gone back to his pose but he might have his man he does! A stumping so quick I don't think even Dhoni was aware what just happened! The Capitals are crumbling.
11.3,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run","full outside off, soft-handed push into the off side on the front foot"
11.2,"Jadeja to Iyer, no run",full and drifting rapidly in at leg stump. Almost plays around this. Manages to jam it out
11.1,"Jadeja to Iyer, no run","full at off stump, hurriedly pushed down the pitch"
10.6,"Tahir to Rutherford, OUT","another googly, another edge! Oh boy. The lure of the dipping ball. How many batsmen have we seen fall to it tonight? Hard hands from Rutherford - hard hands that are far away from the body as he looks to drive. Not near the pitch and a thick edge floats up to backward point"
10.5,"Tahir to Rutherford, no run",floated yorker this time. Jammed down the pitch
10.4,"Tahir to Rutherford, 2 runs","length on leg stump, flicked to deep square off the back foot"
10.3,"Tahir to Rutherford, no run","quicker yorker at middle stump, flicked straight to midwicket"
10.2,"Tahir to Axar Patel, OUT","pouched at first slip! Someone pull the chain because the Tahir express is reeling away yet again. Lovely tossed up googly wide outside off. Axar's instincts act up, much the way Pant's did earlier. He doesn't get anywhere near as good connection though. Watson arches backwards and brings in the reflexes to take this high"
10.1,"Tahir to Iyer, 1 run","full just outside off, driven to sweeper's left"
9.6,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run",gets well forward and dabs this full delivery into the gap at cover
9.5,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, 1 run","some bite off the deck for Jaddu, Axar gets a thick inside edge to deep square"

7.6,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, 1 run","touch short, worked to deep square"
7.5,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, no run",off a thick inside edge to midwicket. Looked to hit it a lot straighter
7.4,"Jadeja to Ingram, OUT","the umpire raised his finger super quickly there and Ingram has reviewed! I think he may have to go here. Ingram completely beaten by the fizz of this Jadeja delivery, plays outside the line, big gap between bat and pad as well. It hit him on the flap of the pad but he was on the backfoot, so the ball didn't have much distance to travel. Hawkeye shows this would've clipped top of leg. So the decision stays and Ingram will have to walk back."
7.3,"Jadeja to Ingram, no run","sharp turn from length outside off, defended."
7.2,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run",driven with the spin to wide long-off for a single
7.1,"Jadeja to Iyer, no run",loopy delivery that he drives inside-out to cover

6.5,"Tahir to Ingram, 1 run",firm push to long-off for a single
6.4,"Tahir to Ingram, no run","googly outside off, left alone"
6.3,"Tahir to Ingram, no run",driven firmly but straight to cover
6.2,"Tahir to Pant, OUT","Open the gates at Wallajah Road, Tahir's coming! Because Pant has picked out Bravo at long-off. Was tossed p again, Pant couldn't hold back. Just looked to belt it but ended up hitting it flat and hard. Good catch"
6.1,"Tahir to Pant, FOUR runs","too much flight, reaches out to loft this over extra cover. Quality stroke"
5.6,"Harbhajan to Iyer, 2 runs",turns this between deep midwicket and wide long-on. Pant hurried Iyer to complete the second there. Good judgment
5.5,"Harbhajan to Iyer, FOUR runs","backs away and slaps this wide of the diving point fielder, top shot"
5.4,"Harbhajan to Pant, 1 run","sliding into the pads, tucked wide of midwicket to get off the mark"
5.3,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, OUT","got him! Bhajji roars, fist pumps because this is a huge moment. Dhawan premeditates and goes for a full-blooded sweep, this drifts in and skids through to beat him comprehensively. Dhawan was through with the shot even before the ball arrived, clean bowled."
5.2,"Harbhajan to Iyer, 1 run",punched down to long-on
5.1,"Harbhajan to Iyer, 2 runs","shortish on middle and leg, whipped into the gap at deep midwicket"

4.5,"Chahar to Iyer, FOUR runs","arches back, uses the pace of the bowler and simply helps him over short third man"
4.4,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","slanting into middle and leg, worked towards deep midwicket"
4.3,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 2 runs","pulled from outside off, Tahir with a sprint from deep backward square leg"
4.2,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run",dab into the off side for a quick single
4.1,"Chahar to Iyer, SIX runs","shot of the night! This guy is a serious player and will definitely challenge for a top order slot post the World Cup cycle. Length - not bad at all - on off and he just picks the line and length so well, goes through to clear extra cover. Didn't over-hit it by any means. Pure timing, pure class. Brilliant"
3.6,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, no run","slider from around the stumps, Dhawan defends from the crease"
3.5,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",gorgeous drive on the up to sweeper cover
3.4,"Harbhajan to Iyer, 1 run",nudged into the gap at midwicket
3.3,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run",steps out and works this quicker delivery on the pads to square leg
3.2,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, SIX runs","sees Dhawan advancing and fires it wide, but he's outfoxed. Dhawan is a step ahead as he reaches out and clobbers this against the turn and across the line to clear long-on"
3.1,"Harbhajan to Iyer, 1 run","shortish on off, worked to long-on"
2.6,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 2 runs","steps out, makes room and slaps this to cover where Bhajji misfields to give away two. To be fair though this was struck really hard"
2.5,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run",punched into the cover region for a quick single
2.4,"Chahar to Iyer, no run",gets on top of the bounce and blocks
2.3,"Chahar to Iyer, 2 runs","gentle bunt to point as they scamper a run even as Jadeja fires a quick throw, misses the stumps at the striker's end and they sneak in an overthrow"

1.4,"Harbhajan to Iyer, 1 run",leading edge wide of cover
1.3,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run",direct hit and Dhawan was struggled. Whipped to mid-on and took off immediately
1.2,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, no run","brings out the reverse-sweep to a delivery bowled on leg stump, hit well but straight to backward point"
1.1,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, no run",cuts to short third man for a quick single
0.6,"Chahar to Iyer, FOUR runs","slips this length ball down leg and Iyer tucks this fine to get off the mark with a boundary. Why Deepak, why?"
0.5,"Chahar to Shaw, OUT","picks out who else but Raina at cover point! This was short, this was wide, he had all the room to thrash this, which he did, but hit it straight to the fielder. Can't believe what he's just done"
0.4,"Chahar to Shaw, no run",high backlift again as it comes down to turn this short of length delivery to midwicket
0.3,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","much straighter even if the length is a touch too full, Shaw plays a full-blooded on-drive to mid-on"
0.2,"Chahar to Shaw, FOUR runs","juicy half-volley and Shaw gleefully whips this in front of square. Poor ball, bread-and-butter shot"
0.1,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","length on middle and leg, wristed to midwicket"
19.6,"Boult to Dhoni, SIX runs","clears deep square! The Dhoni finish! Short ball at leg stump, swivels and pulls from underneath it. Out at the boundary, Dhawan is underneath it as it teases him first and then clears his head"
19.5,"Boult to Dhoni, SIX runs","go and pick that up! Quite literally in this case because it's into the closed stands. Hangs back, picks the offcutter and wallops it over the midwicket boundary. That sounds, my goodness "
19.5,"Boult to Rayudu, 2 wide","full and very wide outside off. Can't get bat on it, but the spikes are in shape as he responds to Dhoni's call and gets to the other end"
19.4,"Boult to Dhoni, 1 run","slower short ball, inside edge onto pad as he looks to pull"
19.3,"Boult to Dhoni, FOUR runs","over the bowler with a subdued helicopter. Or chinna helicopter as they'd call it there in Chepauk. Near yorker length, just missing from Boult. Leg stump line. Gets the front leg out and whips it, flat, over the bowler"
19.2,"Boult to Dhoni, 2 runs","full on leg stump, heaves this out to deep midwicket's right and comes back for the second"
19.1,"Boult to Dhoni, no run","inside edge won't trickle past Pant. Slower ball, skids on and Dhoni is through the slog early. It keeps a tad low"
18.6,"Morris to Dhoni, 1 run","low full toss wide outside off, carted straight to deep extra"
18.6,"Morris to Dhoni, (no ball) SIX runs","beamer goes for six! Morris apologizes to the batsman and then asks the dugout for a towel. Oh boy. Straight up at the shoulder. Dhoni is trying to get out of the way, swipes one handed and manages to get it over the fine leg boundary"
18.5,"Morris to Rayudu, 1 run",high before plopping into the turf well in front of long-on. Slower ball hits the toe-end as he looks for another slog
18.4,"Morris to Rayudu, FOUR runs","speaking of ugly heaves! Rayudu goes for one first ball and it is near perfect. Length at middle, gets it over square leg and beats deep midwicket's slide to the right"
18.3,"Morris to Jadeja, OUT","Morris dupes Jadeja and Morris completes the job! And then he chucks the ball into the ground in frustration. Hasn't been a great season so far and you can see it in his reaction. A top ball though. Offcutter, dipping on Jadeja who would have been thrown out of the nets 10 years ago for attempting this filthy heave into the leg side. It was on though, and it was coming off for him today. Just not this time. Cuts away from a length on off stump, he loses his shape, gets a top edge. Morris runs to his left and holds on at midwicket with a slide to keep his balance"
18.2,"Morris to Dhoni, 1 run",low full toss pushed wide outside off. Scythed out to deep extra cover
18.1,"Morris to Dhoni, FOUR runs","starts poorly again. Overpitched on the pads. Fine leg and square leg are in the circle. Guess where this goes? Right between those two, off the thick inside edge. Dhoni just had to swing hard at this"
17.6,"Boult to Jadeja, SIX runs","pumps it high over long-on! Got right under that! All elevation. Overpitched on middle stump, gets the front leg out of the way and the back leg collapses a little to get flex in the knee. This means a big, big swinging arc from underneath the ball. It dips inwards just a touch and that adds to Jadeja's flourish because this goes off the inside part of the bat. Well over the fielder."
17.5,"Boult to Dhoni, 1 run","slower bouncer. In control this time, Dhoni, but he can't do more than gently pat this to short fine's right"
17.4,"Boult to Jadeja, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven down to long-on"
17.3,"Boult to Dhoni, 1 run","slower ball at a length on leg stump, nudged straight to short fine"
17.2,"Boult to Dhoni, FOUR runs",not in full control but enough bat on this hook. Around the wicket from Boult. Cramps him at grille height. Closes his eyes and swings at it. Top edge goes high and wide of short fine
17.1,"Boult to Jadeja, 1 run","sweet connection on this, but it'll be one. Short ball at middle stump, pulled to deep midwicket's left. Dhoni happy with one, sends him back"
16.6,"Morris to Jadeja, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven along the floor to long-off"
16.5,"Morris to Jadeja, FOUR runs","deft. Smart. Slower ball, short of a length and just outside off. Jadeja has picked it. Allows it to skid on and dabs it fine of short third man"
16.4,"Morris to Dhoni, 1 run","length and in at middle stump, driven off the low part of the bat, down to long-on"
16.3,"Morris to Dhoni, FOUR runs","short, up at middle stump. Dhoni gets his weight onto the back foot and pulls from above the line of the ball. Might have been an offcutter too"
16.2,"Morris to Dhoni, no run",length ball sticks in the pitch as Dhoni gets on the back foot and stabs it back to the bowler
16.1,"Morris to Dhoni, no run","beaten. Wild heave from Dhoni, isn't close to connecting. This length ball climbs over the off stump"
15.6,"Axar Patel to Jadeja, FOUR runs","edge past the keeper! Oh, poor Axar. He's foxed the batsman twice in two balls and still gone for 10. This is slow, at a length, wide outside off. Jadeja down the track and nowhere near the ball. Reaches out, no shape, throws his hands at it and somehow manages to get it past the keeper"
15.5,"Axar Patel to Jadeja, SIX runs","dropped at deep backward square! Length on middle stump, drags this sweep behind square because it's delivered slowly. Rutherford runs to his right, gets under it, but cops it on his shoulder as he looks to keep balance and it bounces over the rope"
15.4,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, punched to sweeper cover off the back foot"
15.3,"Axar Patel to Jadeja, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked through square leg on the front foot"
15.2,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, 1 run","length on middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
15.1,"Axar Patel to Jadeja, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
14.6,"Suchith to Dhoni, no run","length and in at middle stump, hurriedly jammed back to the bowler's right"
14.5,"Suchith to Raina, OUT","taken at point! Suchith, much like Axar, keeps inviting the batsman to step out. Beats him in flight yet again and this time the catch is taken - and just about. Dhawan is pedaling sideways, then back, then front-on and then backwards again before he swivels and hangs on in front of his chest and holds on as he tumbles. Raina was looking to slug across the line and got a top edge"
14.4,"Suchith to Raina, no run","short and just outside off, cut straight to point"
14.3,"Suchith to Raina, SIX runs","nearly taken at long-on! Trent Boult has taken some outrageous catches but today he can only slap the turf in anger. Unrealistic to expect him to take this in the first place. Raina mistimes the slog, not to the pitch. Gets it off the inside half. Boult sprints to his left at long-on and sticks out one hand. Can't hang on"
14.2,"Suchith to Raina, FOUR runs","shot! Fifty for Raina. Length outside off, down the track, meets it, drills it over the bowler. Right off the middle"
14.1,"Suchith to Raina, FOUR runs","length ball wide outside off, leans in and sweeps between deep midwicket and long-on"
13.6,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run","full on off stump, poked back to the bowler"
13.5,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run","past the edge. There's that loop again. Slow, dipping at a length, drawing him in and ripping past the edge"
13.4,"Axar Patel to Raina, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
13.3,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, OUT","Axar invites Faf to hit him again and he gets him this time! Lovely comeback. As beautiful as it is to see a batsman use his feet to hit straight, few things match up to a loopy delivery just managing to beat a batsman in flight. That's what's happened here. Faf is down the pitch and it looks like he can do a repeat of the last ball. But he is inches short of getting to the pitch of this. Ends up getting it off the thick outside edge and Dhawan hangs on at long-off"
13.2,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, SIX runs","oh yes! Faf has been saving his best for us tonight. Another supremely gorgeous hit. Full on off stump, steps out, gets to the pitch and goes with the turn to launch this over the sightscreen. What balance. Superb."
13.1,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, no run","length on off stump, pokes it into the covers on the front foot"
12.6,"Rutherford to du Plessis, 1 run","slower ball short and wide, chopped to sweeper cover"
12.5,"Rutherford to Raina, 1 run","slower short ball at middle, mistimed pull to deep square"
12.4,"Rutherford to du Plessis, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
12.3,"Rutherford to du Plessis, SIX runs","shot! Oh that was worth the wait for the first six of the night. Handsome, inside-out and over the extra cover boundary. It's an offcutter but it skids on from a length outside off. Gets the front foot out but slightly down leg side to make room and gets his hands through the line"
12.3,"Rutherford to du Plessis, 1 wide",short and down leg side. Can't connect on it
12.2,"Rutherford to Raina, 1 run","slower short ball at leg stump, drags a pull to fine leg's left. Ingram with some sliding again"
12.1,"Rutherford to du Plessis, 1 leg bye",overpitched on the pads and he cops it on them as he misses on the flick
11.6,"Mishra to Raina, FOUR runs",over short fine. Mishra chucks one down leg side and Raina chucks his hands at it. Off the middle and over the fielder
11.5,"Mishra to du Plessis, 1 run","tossed up outside off, driven with the turn, inside-out and over extra cover. Dhawan cleans up at long-off. Faf is unhappy with Raina who had turned his back on him and wasn't thinking about a second run"
11.4,"Mishra to du Plessis, no run","quicker one at a length just outside off, punched to extra cover"
11.3,"Mishra to du Plessis, 2 runs","full on middle stump, swept along the floor to deep square's left but Ingram puts in a dive at the line to keep it in"
11.2,"Mishra to Raina, 1 run","googly, short of a length and outside off. Punched to long-off"
11.1,"Mishra to Raina, no run","full and wide outside off. Reaches out and drives, straight to extra cover"
10.6,"Rutherford to Raina, 1 run","full and just outside off, stays leg side and crunches this. Finds sweeper cover"
10.5,"Rutherford to du Plessis, 1 run","diving stop at point from Dhawan. A late cut, slightly on the front foot from Faf. Can't beat Dhawan to his right"
10.4,"Rutherford to Raina, 1 run","slower ball at a length on leg stump, flicked to fine leg"
10.4,"Rutherford to Raina, 1 wide","short and wide outside off, left alone. It's a wide, is the signal from square leg"
10.3,"Rutherford to Raina, 2 runs",slower ball at a length on leg stump. Allows it to come on and tickles it fine

8.6,"Morris to du Plessis, no run","slower and fuller on the stumps, defended"
8.5,"Morris to du Plessis, FOUR runs","helped along to the fine leg boundary. This is like asking a Chennai born-and-bred, do you want idli and filter coffee for breakfast? Of course he'll say yes."

8.3,"Morris to Raina, no run",bunted into the off side
8.2,"Morris to Raina, FOUR runs",flat-batted back over the bowler's head. This is poor bowling from Morris

6.2,"Suchith to Raina, 2 runs","ugly hoick, just eludes point! Shaw little late to get off the blocks, but he may have not got there even if he started early, I guess. Lucky break"
6.1,"Suchith to Raina, FOUR runs","crunching cover drive! Chinna Thala in his elements. Too full, got to the pitch and belted that away"
5.6,"Axar Patel to Raina, 1 run",works this from outside off towards midwicket
5.5,"Axar Patel to Raina, FOUR runs","swept past short fine! Poor ball, too full, too much leg stump and he walloped this"
5.4,"Axar Patel to Raina, FOUR runs","too short, and he's smacked that. Pure timing, really. Made room, allowed it to slide on and lent direction to beat point. Lovely from Raina"

5.2,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, no run","gets too close to the pitch of the ball as he advances, squeezed back"
5.1,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, no run",forces this length ball into the covers
4.6,"Morris to Raina, FOUR runs","reaches out to squeeze behind point, but gets a thick edge over the slips. Third man can't do much"

4.4,"Morris to du Plessis, 1 wide","poor ball, slips this too far down leg, Faf looks to tickle this fine but misses"

4.2,"Morris to du Plessis, FOUR runs",full on the pads and he tickles it down to the fine leg boundary. Easy pickings
4.1,"Morris to du Plessis, no run","gets one to skid back in from wide of the crease, Faf is hit high on the thigh pad as he looks to work this square"

3.2,"Suchith to Watson, OUT"," What have you done, Watto?  He's hit the half-tracker straight down the throat of deep midwicket! Surely Suchith went 'oh, damn' as soon as he dropped short, but a few second later, he was looking up to the skies to thank his stars"
3.1,"Suchith to du Plessis, 1 run","shortish and angling into middle and leg, whipped wide of midwicket"
2.6,"Boult to Watson, no run","beauty! This is a short of length ball that zips past the outside edge as he wafts at it, Pant collects this in front of his face. Serious pace"
2.5,"Boult to Watson, no run","looks to squeeze this full delivery behind point, late on the shot. Bowled at 140.8kph"
2.4,"Boult to Watson, no run",absolutely creams the drive but straight to cover
2.3,"Boult to du Plessis, 1 run","chance missed! A direct hit at the stiker's end from Prithvi and Watson would've been running back to the dugout. Akram-esque late inswing, he somehow manages to tuck this to short midwicket"
2.2,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","advances, but Boult cleverly shortens the length, tucked into the leg side. Pressure building. As Ravi Shastri would often say, 'something's got to give'"

1.6,"Suchith to Watson, no run",skids back in from wide of the crease to hit Watson on the pad as he looks to whip this square.
1.5,"Suchith to Watson, no run","stands outside leg as he tries to go over cover, Suchith follows him and cramps him for room, defended. Top bowling"

0.4,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","peach! Faf expects this to duck back in but this one holds its line, has a waft at it but is beaten"
0.3,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","shortens his length, slants it across, bunted from the crease towards point"
0.2,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","creamed but straight to cover! Nice half-volley, struck well but J Suchith is there"
0.1,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","beauty first up! Hint of movement back in from outside off, Faf plays inside the line as it zips through to Rishabh Pant"
3.2,"Chahal to Samson, OUT","length around off, Samson looks to go over extra cover but ends up skying it over point, a bit of confusion as the two fielders are unsure who is going for it but Negi in the ends pouches it"
3.1,"Chahal to Livingstone, 1 bye","fuller outside off and spinning away, Livingstone throws everything at it but it spins away from him, Parthiv cannot collect it neatly and the batsmen take a bye. This should have been a wide though"
2.6,"Khejroliya to Samson, FOUR runs","fuller and wider outside off this time, Samson throws his hands at it, gets a thick outside edge between the keeper and the short third man"
2.5,"Khejroliya to Samson, SIX runs","length ball around middle and off, Samson stands in his crease and just lofts it over long-on, holds his shape and it goes all the way for a six"
2.4,"Khejroliya to Samson, no run","length outside off and angling across the batsman, Samson looks to hit it through the off side and misses, too wide but the umpire doesn't think so"
2.3,"Khejroliya to Livingstone, 1 leg bye","moves across towards the off side and looks to scoop it away but Khejroliya follows the batsman and bowls it full and wide, Livingstone ends up scooping it on to his pads. They run a single nonetheless"
2.2,"Khejroliya to Samson, 1 run","length outside off, backs away and looks to flat-bat it this time, mistimes it towards long-off"
2.1,"Khejroliya to Samson, SIX runs","length ball, angling away from the batsman but Samson fetches it and pulls it over deep midwicket, just clearing the fielder there"
1.6,"Saini to Livingstone, no run","fuller and wider outside off, Livingstone looks to reach for it but cannot put bat on to the ball, a precious dot ball"
1.5,"Saini to Livingstone, no run","a slower one, length outside off, Livingstone was early into the shot, looked to heave it on the leg side, the ball hits the toe end and on the bounce to the keeper"
1.4,"Saini to Samson, 1 run","length ball around off, goes for the pull but mistimes it towards deep square leg, only a single. More like a drag than a pull"
1.3,"Saini to Livingstone, 1 run","a high full toss and Klaasen almost pulls of a stunner, at cover. Flung himself to his right, got his hand to it when the ball had already passed him but he fails to latch on to"
1.2,"Saini to Livingstone, SIX runs","toe-end of the bat but it sails over long-off, all the way for a six. Was short of length outside off, Livingstone went for a tennis-like forehand, got enough on it"
1.1,"Saini to Livingstone, FOUR runs","length ball around off, Livingstone clears his front leg and clubs it over midwicket, gets four"
0.6,"Yadav to Samson, no run","fuller and wider outside off, steered but straight towards backward point"
0.5,"Yadav to Samson, no run","length ball at 146.5 kph, on the stumps and hurries on to Samson who looks to pull it away, mistimed towards mid-on"
0.4,"Yadav to Samson, no run","Umesh corrects his line this time, almost a replica of the first ball of the over, short of length outside off and swinging away, Samson looks to hit it through the off side, misses"
0.3,"Yadav to Samson, FOUR runs","length but straying on the pads, swiped away by Samson this time, over backward square leg for four"
0.2,"Yadav to Samson, SIX runs","length ball on the body, Samson plays a short-arm pull, off the front foot and smashes it over deep midwicket, utter disdain"
0.1,"Yadav to Samson, no run","length ball outside off, swinging away as Samson looks to hit it on the up but misses. An appeal by the bowler for caught-behind but nothing on the UltraEdge"
4.6,"Thomas to Saini, 1 bye","back of a length, wide outside off, and Saini can't connect with the cut. They scamper across for byes as Samson misses the direct hit"
4.5,"Thomas to Negi, OUT","sharp catch by the keeper! A 145.1kph fireball on off, and Negi swivels to slog over midwicket. The ball, however, takes some extra bounce and collects a feather-edge off the bat"
4.4,"Thomas to Negi, FOUR runs","top-edged over the keeper! Short on middle, and he goes for a wild pull. Catches the bat's edge and RCB collect four more runs"
4.3,"Thomas to Klaasen, OUT","leading edge to deep cover! Full, on middle, and Klaasen looks to deposit this over midwicket. But the ball held it's line, and therefore took the bat's splice. In the air for a long time before Livingstone dives forward to complete the catch"
4.2,"Thomas to Negi, 1 bye","length ball, outside off, and angling further away. Negi tries to cut, but misses, and they scamper across for bye-runs. Negi is surprised that the umpire didn't call it a wide. Brave from Negi to run though"
4.1,"Thomas to Klaasen, 1 run","full on middle, and he clears his front leg to smash a shot past the non-striker. Long on intercepts"
4.1,"Thomas to Klaasen, (no ball)","front-foot no ball! Full and fast outside off stump, but Klaasen misses the slog"
3.6,"Unadkat to Patel, OUT","cheeky, but doesn't pay off! Length ball outside off, and Parthiv shuffles across his stumps to try and ramp it past short fine leg. Slices the shot, and Oshane is in the ball's path"
3.5,"Unadkat to Patel, no run","slower ball! Parthiv swings but misses. Length ball, just outside off, and Parthiv shapes up to slog leg-side. He's through the shot too early though"
3.4,"Unadkat to Patel, 2 runs","length ball, wide outside off, and he carves this off the back foot to deep point. Terrific commitment from Rahane at the deep, sliding across the ground to stop the boundary"
3.3,"Unadkat to Patel, 2 runs","Klaasen takes cover! Full on middle, and he drills this straight. The non-striker does well to duck, and long-on does even better to stop the ball"
3.2,"Unadkat to Patel, FOUR runs","length ball, just outside off, and Parthiv tries to check-pull along the ground. But the delivery takes some extra bounce, and Parthiv has managed to top-edge this over short fine leg"

2.6,"Parag to Klaasen, 1 run","full on off, and drilled down the ground to long on"
2.5,"Parag to Gurkeerat, OUT","another medium-pace delivery, and he tries to clear wide long on. Slogged to the leg side, but not timed well, and the fielder at cow corner comfortably pouches this. Parag dances after taking the wicket. Ah, the innocence of youth!"
2.4,"Parag to Gurkeerat, FOUR runs","length ball on leg, and he tries to sweep behind square. Top-edge takes it over the keeper's head, and the ball bounces across the boundary-line"
2.3,"Parag to Gurkeerat, 2 runs","fast ball, half-tracker on middle, and guided off his hips to deep midwicket. Gently played, so Mann manages to run back for the second"
2.2,"Parag to Klaasen, 1 run","full on middle, and the googly is mistimed down the ground to long on"
2.1,"Parag to Klaasen, 2 runs","full on middle, and clipped off his toes to deep backward square for a single"
1.6,"Gopal to Stoinis, OUT","that's a hat-trick for Shreyas Gopal! Full, just outside off, and the legbreak is driven straight. But it's hit in the air, and mid-off gets behind it. Smith holds on to Stoinis, and Gopal is doing a Tahir!"
1.5,"Gopal to AB, OUT","First Kohli, and now AB! This was the legbreak, full outside off, and he tries to slap this over cover. slices the shot, though, and it's too easy for the fielder running in from cover. Gopal does the double over Kohli and de Villiers in IPL 2019"
1.4,"Gopal to Kohli, OUT","holes out! Silence at the Chinnaswamy. Full on off, and the Kohli goes for the big shot again. Tries to lift it over long on again, and the ball was wide enough for him use his arms, but it comes off the toe-end of his bat and Livingstone makes no mistake"
1.3,"Gopal to Kohli, 2 runs","full on middle, and Kohli goes straight over Gopal's head this time. Smacked over the bowler, but Livingstone at long-on dives across the ground to intercept the ball. His knee takes a blow due to the wet ground, but looks alright. Terrific effort, saving two runs"
1.2,"Gopal to Kohli, FOUR runs","bang, bang! Full, just outside off, and the googly is drilled past the fielder at mid-on! Runs away to the straight boundary"
1.1,"Gopal to Kohli, SIX runs","full, on off, and Kohli clears his front leg before whipping a six over long on! Big stride forward, and clean striking thereafter"
0.6,"Aaron to AB, FOUR runs","full on off, and the inswinger is picked up and deposited to the wide long-on fence. Clears his front leg to swing across the line, and gets enough muscle to beat the fielder in the deep"
0.5,"Aaron to AB, 2 runs","full, on off but swinging inwards. He mistimes a leg-side slog to deep midwicket"
0.4,"Aaron to AB, FOUR runs","length ball, wide outside off, and he tries to punch through the covers. Ball takes the outside edge because of some extra bounce, and flies away to the third-man fence"
0.3,"Aaron to Kohli, 1 run","slower, and a well-directed yorker on middle. Swings into Kohli's pads, and worked away to midwicket"
0.2,"Aaron to Kohli, SIX runs","sliced, but over third man! The men in the RCB dugout can't hold on to it either. Smarter ball, length outside off and angling in, but Kohli throws his hands at this. Looks to go inside-out over cover again, but outside-edge takes the ball over the fielder inside the circle"
0.1,"Aaron to Kohli, SIX runs","glorious! Full, just outside off, and he simply lifts this over long off! So what if it's nearly 148kph? Kohli picked that length up perfectly"
19.6,"Sandeep to Ashwin, 1 run",it all ends with a knuckle ball that is nudged through midwicket. All very tame
19.5,"Sandeep to Shami, 1 run",defends the slower ball on middle through midwicket
19.4,"Sandeep to Mujeeb, OUT",clatters into the stumps and the slower ball takes out Mujeeb - a duck and 0 for 66 for him in this game
19.3,"Sandeep to Mujeeb, no run","another knuckle ball, another swing and miss outside off"
19.2,"Sandeep to Mujeeb, no run",does him with the knuckle ball and Mujeeb has already swung himself clean off his feet by the time the ball passed him outside off
19.1,"Sandeep to Prabhsimran Singh, OUT",traps him lbw but he's reviewed it straight away. It's the no-nonsense yorker. Full and straight. Prabhsimran plays all around it and is pinned on the back leg. Could it be going down? There's definitely no bat and HawkEye says it's umpire's call on impact and umpire's call on hitting the stumps.
18.6,"Ahmed to Prabhsimran Singh, 1 run",nails the yorker from round the wicket and Prabhsimran slices it through point
18.5,"Ahmed to Prabhsimran Singh, FOUR runs",stays beside the back of a length ball on off stump and lifts it over short third man
18.4,"Ahmed to Prabhsimran Singh, no run",
18.3,"Ahmed to Prabhsimran Singh, no run","back of a length and outside off, cuts and misses"
18.2,"Ahmed to Rahul, OUT","looooovely Kane! He runs to his right from extra cover, and this is a hiiiiiiiigh ball. For the longest time it looks like it will evade him, but he tracks it down somewhere near mid-off, puts in the dive and takes it almost easily. Gets a kiss on his cap for that trouble from Khaleel. Rahul's innings ends looking for a big shot , over cover, he doesn't time properly. Piled the pressure on himself. Couldn't claw out of it"
18.2,"Ahmed to Rahul, 1 wide","bouncer, but it's too short and soars over the ducking Rahul"
18.1,"Ahmed to Rahul, 2 runs",takes all the pace off and that's why Rahul's heave over midwicket ends up falling short of the boundary. Vijay flicks it back as he runs to his left from midwicket and Nabi collects it to throw it back in
17.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Prabhsimran Singh, SIX runs","launches it over long-off. Prabhsimran is deep in his crease against this almost wide yorker and he gets under it so well, sending it miles over Warner"
17.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Prabhsimran Singh, no run",beats him. This is class bowling. He knows the youngster is backing away. He knows he can do him if he takes the pace off and keeps it wide outside off
17.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Prabhsimran Singh, 2 runs","backs away and cuts the shortish delivery on off stump away behind point. He's finally getting his timing right, and it's because he's holding his shape better"
17.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Prabhsimran Singh, 1 wide","goes for the bouncer against the inexperienced batsman, but it climbs up too far. Prabhsimran can't reach it with his ramp shot"
17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, 1 run",another yorker - this one tailing into the right-hander at the last - and a set Rahul is only able to nudge it to midwicket. Buh-rilliant execution from one of India's best bowlers
17.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","looks for the reverse scoop, but Bhuvi bowls the most delicious yorker, the ball going right through his legs and, unfortunately for SRH, missing leg stump"
17.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, 2 runs","vintage Warner! Down in the long-off boundary, picking up the bludgeon down the ground early, moving quickly to his right, diving full length and stopping a certain boundary"
16.6,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","low full toss outside off, Rahul smears it to deep point"
16.5,"Sandeep to Prabhsimran Singh, 1 run",slices the full delivery outside off to deep point
16.4,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","walks across, correctly predicting the bowler's plans to hide it outside off, but he mis-hits it down to long-off"
16.3,"Sandeep to Rahul, SIX runs",one-handed! He's deep in his crease. He's reaching down low for the ball. He's lost his shape. But somehow he times it well enough that it sails over the straight boundary
16.2,"Sandeep to Prabhsimran Singh, 1 run","short ball, knuckle ball, which Prabhsimran manages to heave it in the air to deep square leg, placing it between midwicket running back and the boundary rider coming forward"
16.1,"Sandeep to Prabhsimran Singh, no run","finds the yorker and Prabhsimran is only able to steer it to cover. Rahul, at the non-strkers', is desperate to regain the strike but he has to be sent back"
15.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","Top work, Abhishek! He's at point and Rahul is looking to smear a near yorker over his head. The open face comes out. The timing is perfect but the fielder leaps up and snatches the ball out of thin air"
15.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, FOUR runs","backs away and carves the shortish delivery on middle and off over extra cover. Brutal and beautiful. Yep, he's finally going for it now"
15.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","low full toss, Rahul miscues it to extra cover, the lack of pace, and possibly it dipping on him the last moment, messing with his timing"
15.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","legcutter on off stump, Rahul keeps still and pushes to extra cover"
15.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, 2 runs","back of a length on off stump, Rahul slices it behind point and sprints through for the second. Looks like he's finally decided it's time"
15.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, SIX runs",length and Rahul deposits it over long-on. Keeps a stable base and swings through the line. Languid goodness
14.6,"Rashid Khan to Prabhsimran Singh, no run","shapes to cut, but this is the googly, and after pitching outside off, it snarls into the right-hander, nearly pinning him lbw"
14.5,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, 1 run",looks to turn the flighted delivery outside off through midwicket but ends up with a leading edge through cover
14.4,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, no run",goes back and blocks the quicker legbreak outside off
14.3,"Rashid Khan to Prabhsimran Singh, 1 run",sees a loopy delivery well wide of off stump and thumps it back down to long-on
14.2,"Rashid Khan to Prabhsimran Singh, no run",inside edge as he tries to late cut a flatter delivery outside off. Nearly drags it onto his stumps
14.1,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, 1 run","googly, tossed up on off stump, spinning into the right-hander. Rahul lunges forward to block and finds a single through midwicket"
13.6,"M Nabi to Prabhsimran Singh, no run","holds his length back and Prabhsimran goes searching for the ball outside off, trying a late cut, and missing"
13.5,"M Nabi to Prabhsimran Singh, no run",gets forward to block the flighted delivery outside off
13.4,"M Nabi to Prabhsimran Singh, no run","tosses it up outside off, Prabhsimran drills it back to Nabi"
13.3,"M Nabi to Rahul, 1 run",nudges a fuller delivery outside off to long-on
13.2,"M Nabi to Rahul, SIX runs","gets to fifty by picking on a rank long hop, swivelling on the back foot and pulling it over deep square leg"
13.1,"M Nabi to Rahul, SIX runs","a little width on offer and Rahul exploits it beautifully, lofting the ball over extra cover. Outstanding strike"
12.6,"Rashid Khan to Ashwin, OUT","picks out long-on! This is the googly, invitingly tossed up outside off. Ashwin goes with the spin, but he only picks out Manish Pandey. Rashid's on a hat-trick"
12.5,"Rashid Khan to Miller, OUT","hammers it straight to deep midwicket. There is so much power in this pull shot. Bends his knees to get low and get under the ball. But as much power as he puts in it, he doesn't get enough elevation. Huh, usually it's the other way round for a wicket to fall!"
12.4,"Rashid Khan to Miller, no run","98 kph and he almost bowls him. He pitches the slider on leg stump. And since the trajectory is flat, Miller thinks he should cut it. Goes back, makes room, and then watches as the ball skids on, looking to topple his sticks. Just about stops that"
12.3,"Rashid Khan to Miller, 2 runs","this time he connects with the sweep, thanks in part to the tossed up ball being outside off. Strong shot, but Vijay Shankar on the boundary puts in a lovely effort. Sprints about 10 yards, puts in the full-length dive and saves a run"
12.2,"Rashid Khan to Miller, no run","googly, and he's not picked it. Goes for the sweep because the line of the ball is leg stump. Misses the shot and gets struck on the pads. Weathers an lbw shout as well"
12.1,"Rashid Khan to Miller, FOUR runs","drags the length short and it's punished as Miller rocks back and pulls it mightily, in front of square and to the boundary"
11.6,"M Nabi to Miller, 1 run","finishes off with another low full toss, which Miller can only slap down the ground to long-off"
11.5,"M Nabi to Rahul, 1 run","low full toss on off stump, Rahul whips it to deep midwicket"
11.4,"M Nabi to Miller, 1 run",backs away to cut the short ball on middle out to the sweeper cover
11.3,"M Nabi to Miller, no run",jams it almost into the blockhole and Miller is only able to dig it out of the base of middle stump
11.2,"M Nabi to Miller, no run",
11.1,"M Nabi to Miller, 2 runs","round the wicket to deliver a dart on leg stump, Miller clips it through midwicket"
10.6,"Ahmed to Miller, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, Miller taps it behind point"
10.5,"Ahmed to Pooran, OUT","claims the catch, Bhuvi you beauty!. He's on the long leg boundary. He needs to run in, and then move to his right, dive forward, grab the ball inches off the ground and then make sure his elbow doesn't jam into the ground. That usually makes the ball pop out of your hands. But it doesn't here. Splendid technique. And a word about the ball too: Khaleel got hit for six off this length - the short length angled at the body. Credit to him for trying it again and this time securing the top edge as Pooran hooked"
10.4,"Ahmed to Pooran, FOUR runs","stays low because he needs to with a length ball on off stump, and by staying low, he's able to get under it and basically scoops it to the square leg boundary. Brilliantly innovative batting"
10.3,"Ahmed to Pooran, no run","shortish and outside off, he goes for the cut, but the extra effort from the left-arm quick makes it bounce over his bat"
10.2,"Ahmed to Pooran, FOUR runs",pitches it up and watches it disappear. A simple front-foot stride and a full flow of the bat. #Magic
10.1,"Ahmed to Pooran, SIX runs","crosses the boundary while taking the catch! It just did not look like Pooran got that much into this pull. He's got his eyes off the ball, which by the way is getting big on him. He whips it as it climbs up towards his chest, Bhuvi's down there, he tracks it really well, backpedals to the boundary, leaps up, takes it with both hands - but the momentum takes him over the ropes"
9.6,"M Nabi to Pooran, 1 run","fuller, on off, and he drills a square drive to the sweeper-fielder on the off side"
9.5,"M Nabi to Pooran, SIX runs","over long on! Full on off, and that's in Pooran slot. Gets his front leg to the pitch of the ball, and hammers this to the second tier"
9.4,"M Nabi to Pooran, no run","length ball, on middle from around the wicket. Fended with soft hands towards the off side"
9.3,"M Nabi to Rahul, 1 run","full, just outside off, and he drives with the turn to long on"
9.2,"M Nabi to Rahul, 2 runs","reverse swept! But Khaleel does well - from short third man - to stop the ball. Full on off, and Rahul was quick to play that shot. Kings XI could've taken a third had Rahul not assumed the ball to go for four"
9.1,"M Nabi to Rahul, no run","length ball, just outside off, and he works it towards the leg side. Can't go past Williamson at midwicket"
8.6,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, no run","full on middle, and the legbreak is inside-edged onto his pads. A successful over for Sunrisers"
8.5,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, no run","length ball, on middle, and he punches this googly back to Rashid"
8.4,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, OUT","holes out! Too easy for Rashid. Goes full on middle, and Mayank looks to slog-sweep. Struck well, but not far enough, and the fielder at cow corner waits for the ball to come to him. Not smart from Mayank. They had collected eight off Rashid's over already "
8.3,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, SIX runs","smoked! Full on off, and he picks the legbreak well. Settles down on one knee and lifts this over Rashid's head"
8.2,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, 1 run","length ball on off, and turning into Rahul's pads. Nudged off his pads to square leg for one"
8.1,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off, and he cuts the googly to point. Well stopped by the diving fielder"
7.6,"Sandeep to Agarwal, 1 run","full, slower ball on middle, and worked away past the square-leg umpire to the sweeper in the deep. Time out"
7.5,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and firmly punched off the back foot to long on"
7.4,"Sandeep to Rahul, no run","length ball, on off stump, and swinging just away from Rahul. He comes forward to defend, but the legcutter whizzes past his outside edge. Beautiful shape"
7.3,"Sandeep to Rahul, FOUR runs","full on leg, and he flicks this off his toes past Khaleel at fine leg! On the bounce for four"
7.2,"Sandeep to Rahul, no run","length ball, wide outside off, and guided away to point"
7.1,"Sandeep to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off, and guided fine past point. Fielder there near the boundary though"
7.1,"Sandeep to Agarwal, 1 wide",length ball on middle from Sandeep. But the ball angles down leg. He needs to reload
6.6,"Abhishek to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball, on off, and nudged away off his pads to midwicket for one"
6.5,"Abhishek to Agarwal, FOUR runs","length ball, on off, and he carves a cut right over cover! Ball bounces awkwardly in front of Rashid, and bounces over his head despite a valiant attempt"
6.4,"Abhishek to Rahul, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off, and cut square to Rashid at deep point"
6.3,"Abhishek to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball on middle, and he goes deep into his crease. Muscles a pull to wide long on this time"
6.2,"Abhishek to Rahul, 1 run",length ball outside off from the left-arm spinner. Lands and turns away from the batsman. Pulled along the ground to deep midwicket
6.1,"Abhishek to Agarwal, 1 run","full, just outside off, and Agarwal slaps this inside-out over cover. Warner takes the catch at long off but that's a free hit. Mayank survives"
6.1,"Abhishek to Rahul, (no ball) 1 run","length ball on middle, and punched down the ground to long on for a walking single. But that's a no ball! Front-foot. Massive no ball"
5.6,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, 1 run","length ball on off, and turning into his pads. Nudged away to square leg"
5.5,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, no run","huge appeal for lbw but not given. Full, just outside off, and the googly spins inwards. He comes forward to defend, but misses the shot, and Rashid appeals for lbw. Rashid wants the review but Saha isn't convinced. Rashid gets overruled, and Sunrisers save a review. Impact was outside off"
5.4,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball on middle, and he goes deep into his crease to pull behind square. Goes through to fine leg on the bounce"
5.3,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, no run","length ball, on off, and the googly turns inwards. He checks a cut-shot to point"
5.2,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, 1 run","length ball on middle, and flicked off his pads to square leg"
5.1,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball, back of a length, and punched off the back foot to long on"
4.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off but angling in. He opens the bat's face and guides it down to third man"
4.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, 1 run","full, wide outside off, and allows Rahul to free his arms. Driven through the covers, but Williamson manages to intercept"
4.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","full on off, and drilled to mid on. No chance of a run"
4.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","full, just outside off, and he caresses a drive to cover"
4.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, 2 runs","full, just outside off, and that's gone into orbit! Tries to flick it to deep midwicket, but it doesn't have the distance. In the air for ages, and Rashid runs backwards from mid-on, but the ball lands just beyond him. At first this looked like six, but eventually just a couple for Kings XI"
4.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, 2 runs","full outside leg, and angling into the batsman who has stepped back to get some extra room. Driven inside-out to cover"
3.6,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","length ball on middle, and angling down leg. But he flicks it off his hips to square leg instead"
3.6,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 wide","length ball, on middle, and angling down the leg side"
3.5,"Sandeep to Rahul, FOUR runs","outta here! Full on middle, but Rahul puts his front leg across the stumps before muscling a paddle-sweep over the fielder at short fine leg. Terrific improvisation to play the shot while showing all three stumps. Replays, though, suggest that the ball landed just inside the boundary skirting."
3.4,"Sandeep to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball on off, and he muscles a pull to deep midwicket"
3.3,"Sandeep to Agarwal, FOUR runs","full on leg, and clipped away to square leg. Rashid gives up on the chance from short-fine leg"
3.2,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball, length outside leg and Mayank displays all three stumps before tapping it down to mid-off"
3.1,"Sandeep to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball on middle, and angling into leg stump. Mistimes the flick, and it hits his pads before rolling away to point"
2.6,"Ahmed to Agarwal, 1 run","back of a length on leg, and flicked to midwicket for a quick single"
2.5,"Ahmed to Rahul, 1 run","length ball on middle, and slower from Khaleel too. Tapped with the bat's open face to point"
2.4,"Ahmed to Agarwal, 1 run","full on off, and he drives away from his body. Outside edge takes the ball down to third man"
2.3,"Ahmed to Rahul, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and nudged away to point"
2.2,"Ahmed to Rahul, SIX runs","'oh wow', goes Simon Doull on commentary! Doesn't matter that Gayle just fell. Full on middle, and he clips this nonchalantly over to the leg-side stand"
2.1,"Ahmed to Gayle, OUT","that's a ridiculous take from Pandey! Length ball outside off, and Gayle tries to clatter this over cover off the back foot. Takes the bat's splice, and goes into the air. Pandey gets under it at cover, and dives forward to take the catch. He takes the catch while his body hits the ground, but the ball pops out of his hands for a moment. Lucky for Pandey, the ball got stuck between his fingers and his chin, and the Sunrisers players rush around him to celebrate the big wicket"
1.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","length ball, just outside off, and tapped off the back foot to mid-off"
1.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","back of a length, just outside off, and he mistimes the slower ball back to Bhuvi. That's four dots in a row"
1.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","full on off, and angling into Rahul. He comes onto the front foot to block towards the off side"
1.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","length ball, wide outside off, and punched off the back foot to cover point"
1.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run","length ball, on off, and he comes onto the front foot to defend"
1.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, FOUR runs","flies over first slip! Full, outside off and swinging away. Rahul throws his hands at this, and the attempted cover drive takes the bat's outside edge"
0.6,"Ahmed to Gayle, no run","length ball on off, and whizzing past the batsman's outside edge to the keeper"
0.5,"Ahmed to Gayle, FOUR runs","full, wide outside off, and Gayle backs away to muscle a shot over cover. Ball flies off the bat's toe end and races away to the backward-point boundary. The extra ball hurts Sunrisers"
0.4,"Ahmed to Rahul, 1 run","length ball, leg stump, and nudged off his pads to square leg. Just a single"
0.4,"Ahmed to Rahul, 1 wide","length ball, angling across off, and left alone"
0.3,"Ahmed to Rahul, no run","length ball, on off, and he nudges towards the leg side with the bat's face closed. Stopped by midwicket"
0.2,"Ahmed to Rahul, no run","big appeal for lbw and not given! Khaleel can't believe it. Lands on middle-and-leg, and comes into Rahul. He misses the flick, and ball hits his front leg. Replays suggest that the ball was on leg stump all along, but height may have been a concern"
0.1,"Ahmed to Rahul, no run","length ball, wide outside leg but coming into his body. Defended towards the bowler"
0.1,"Ahmed to Rahul, 1 wide","full, just outside leg stump, and going down the leg side. Through to the keeper"
19.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Shankar, 2 runs","full toss on off stump, Vijay lofts down the ground for a couple of runs"
19.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Abhishek, 1 run","full and angling into leg stump, Abhishek makes room and lifts it to long-off"
19.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Abhishek, FOUR runs",misses his yorker and Abhishek does well to hold his shape and lifts the ball over mid-off. Outstanding cricket. There's such a temptation to slog in these times but the youngster does not succumb
19.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Abhishek, 1 wide",slips down leg. The length is right - another yorker - but the line goes just a tiny bit wrong
19.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Shankar, 1 run","another yorker, this one shaping across the right-hander. Vijay is squared up as he blocks, getting a single to point off the outside half of the bat"
19.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Abhishek, 1 leg bye","low full toss on leg stump - there's swing here, possibly reverse - Abhishek tries to whip it away but does not make any connection. Vijay, at the non-strikers', wants the leg bye and gets it"
19.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Rashid Khan, OUT","outstanding stuff. Rashid is moving all over the place. Walking across, then walking back. Trying to throw young Arshdeep off his lengths. But he takes none of it. Looks for the leg-stump yorker. And absolutley nails it. Rashid is outside leg stump right now and makes a last ditch effort to chop a horizontal bat down on the ball. He's beaten for pace. Utterly"
18.6,"Shami to Shankar, 2 runs",yorker becomes a full toss which Vijay lifts overmidwicket
18.5,"Shami to Shankar, 2 runs","lands another inswinging yorker on the base of middle stump, Vijay digs it out to cover and sprints through. Needless throw gives up extra runs. M Ashwin the culprit"
18.4,"Shami to M Nabi, OUT",takes out two of the three stumps and Shami just walks off. No celebration. He knows this total is a monster. But it is still a skillful piece of bowling. Full. Straight. Nearly a yorker. Nabi clears his front leg and swings. he misses
18.3,"Shami to Rashid Khan, 1 run",inswinging yorker and Rashid is just about able to squirt it away to fine leg with an inside edge
18.2,"Shami to Williamson, OUT","outstanding take!. M Ashwin at cover, leaping up to wrangle a cut shot that Williamson intends to send over him. The fielder is up off his feet, both hands over his head, and he plucks it out of thin air. Beautiful stuff. And a slower short ball does indeed do the trick. Shami's gone to it so often this innings"
18.1,"Shami to M Nabi, 1 run",good fielding at mid-off by R Ashwin. Moves to his left and puts in the dive to stop a yorker that Nabi has hammered all along the ground. Looks set to reach the extra cover boundary until the Kings XI captain butted in
18.1,"Shami to M Nabi, 1 wide","goes for the bouncer on middle and off stump, Nabi tries to ramp over third man, but the ball keeps climbing and the umpire penalises Shami for it. Rightly so"
17.6,"Mujeeb to M Nabi, 1 run",walks across and tries to heave the good length - off-pace - ball outside off. But he ends up cue-ending it to deep point.
17.5,"Mujeeb to M Nabi, SIX runs","that's the most expensive spell of bowling this IPL. Nabi bestows his country-mate with that label, launching a length ball on off stump away over his head. Those two wides made him bowl straight and now he gets punished"
17.5,"Mujeeb to M Nabi, 1 wide","another one that he wants to hide outside off, but skirts the wrong side of the wide line"
17.5,"Mujeeb to M Nabi, 1 wide","good response, seeing the batsman making room and firing in the wide yorker. Just one problem. The umpire says it's too wide"
17.4,"Mujeeb to M Nabi, SIX runs","launches it! See, he's an awesome hitter. And he proves it by taking on a length ball on off stump and making it disappear over the bowler's head"
17.3,"Mujeeb to Williamson, 1 run",works a full ball on off stump down to long-on
17.2,"Mujeeb to Williamson, SIX runs",that's poor bowling. Short. Angled down leg. All Kane has to do is get under it and he does that with a no-holds-barred sweep shot
17.1,"Mujeeb to Williamson, FOUR runs","outside edge! Williamson backs away to try and smoke it over extra cover. But the ball skews away over Gayle, and just as he catches up with the ball, he tries to stop it with his feet and instead kicks it over the boundary"
16.6,"Shami to Williamson, 1 run",pushes the shortish delivery outside off to sweeper cover. Only six off that over. Kings XI definitely have a shout here
16.5,"Shami to M Nabi, 1 run",inside edge as Nabi stays stuck in his crease and throws his bat at a full ball outside off. Pings away to fine leg
16.4,"Shami to Williamson, 1 run",back foot punch to the sweeper cover. Mike Hesson spoke of targeting him with short lengths. His bowlers are doing just that
16.3,"Shami to M Nabi, 1 run",goes for the yorker and Nabi whips it down to long-on. He was looking more over square leg but miscues it
16.2,"Shami to Williamson, 1 run",works the back of a length ball off his hips to deep midwicket
16.1,"Shami to M Nabi, 1 run",slashes the short and wide delivery and the outside edge takes it down to deep third man
15.6,"Ashwin to Warner, OUT","goes round-arm again and it works. Warner is reaching out to this ball outside off. There's no pace on it too. All that means he has to put in all the power and he just doesn't have any at this stage of the innings. A tired shot. A tired dismissal. But Hyderabad loves him. He walks off to raucaous cheers and he sends a kiss there way. It's his last game this season, will he win it?"
15.5,"Ashwin to M Nabi, 1 run",stays back and punches the flatter delivery outside off to sweeper cover
15.4,"Ashwin to M Nabi, 2 runs",flicks a shortish delivery on off stump through midwicket and pinches two.
15.3,"Ashwin to Pandey, OUT","taken at short fine leg. Pandey does well, initially, getting inside the line of a carrom ball. But it doesn't really bounce and he can't get under it like he wants. That means he can't get power into the scoop shot that he wants to play. Walks off angry at his mistake."
15.2,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","inside edge as Warner tries to cut a loopy, off-stump yorker out to short fine leg. Might have been the arm ball"
15.1,"Ashwin to Warner, no run",goes round-arm and the advancing Warner can only block the back of a length ball on leg stump back down the pitch
14.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, 1 run","another back of a length slower ball, cramping the batsman, Warner dinks it to vacant midwicket and keeps strike"
14.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Pandey, 1 run","back over the wicket now, and a slower ball on the pads is sent to long leg"
14.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Pandey, FOUR runs","goes round the wicket and targets the batsman's head. It's coming right in between the eyes of Pandey. And he just calmly swivels on his back foot and pulls it over short fine leg. That's not the field for this kind of bowling, but it was a decent ball"
14.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, 1 run","surprises the batsman with a banged-in slower ball on off stump. Warner, almost coming down the track, has to stop and then adjust to the lack of pace and then chop it through point"
14.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, FOUR runs",past short fine leg! He's the only fielder up on the leg side and Arshdeep bowls a yorker outside leg-stump. All Warner needs to do is place it and he does that very very well
14.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, 2 runs","short-arm pulls it out to deep square leg, doing just enough to wait on the slower short ball angled into him"
13.6,"Mujeeb to Warner, 1 run",whips a leg-stump yorker out to long-off. Is it just me or is Warner tiring a bit?. He's not holding his shape as much as he used to early on
13.5,"Mujeeb to Warner, 2 runs","goes for the flat-batted swat down the ground, but ends up getting an outside edge that lobs over short third man. Shami was in business for a few seconds "
13.4,"Mujeeb to Warner, FOUR runs","reverse sweeps it away!. And the funny thing is, there is no pace on this ball. It's loopy. And it's way outside off. It's meant to deny Warner his power. But he backs himself. Goes for the unorthodox shot and pulls it off superbly"
13.3,"Mujeeb to Warner, 2 runs",takes on a length ball outside off and hammers it in between deep midwicket and long-on
13.2,"Mujeeb to Pandey, 1 run",hangs back and cuts the shortish delivery outside off behind point
13.1,"Mujeeb to Pandey, 2 runs",opens his body up to flat-bat a short delivery spinning into off stump - and bouncing a bit awkwardly - out to long-off
12.6,"Ashwin to Warner, 2 runs",works it away through midwicket and that takes us to the time out
12.5,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","lovely footwork, getting both of em out of the way of a very full delivery on leg stump so he can unveil a full swing of the bat and sends the ball to long-on"
12.4,"Ashwin to Pandey, no run",spears it into the pads and it slips down leg while Pandey tries to flick
12.3,"Ashwin to Pandey, SIX runs",in the slot and he makes it disappear! Pandey sees the flight in this and immediately clears the front leg and goes gung-ho down the ground. Spectacular hitting
12.2,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","tossed up on leg stump, he gets down and sweeps it to long leg"
12.1,"Ashwin to Warner, 2 runs","long hop, but with Ashwin bowling a slow pace, it sticks in the wicket and Warner, for once, doesn't do well delaying his shot, those milliseconds result in a loss of power and balance. Finds square leg on the boundary"
11.6,"Shami to Warner, 1 run","slow and short again but Warner isn't deceived. He just waits for the ball, holding his shape, and cuts it to deep point"
11.5,"Shami to Warner, 2 runs",hoicks a slower ball - short of a length too - out to deep midwicket
11.4,"Shami to Warner, no run",dabs the short ball on middle to point
11.3,"Shami to Warner, 2 runs","tickles a back of a length ball on leg stump to the right of deep midwicket, specifically to get two runs"
11.2,"Shami to Warner, FOUR runs","another fifty, his eighth of the season. And it happens with a late cut. He intends to get the ball fine to the third man boundary, but a thick outside edge helps him out"
11.1,"Shami to Pandey, 1 run","dropped! But catches like these need to stick. And R Ashwin did so well to actually turn it into a chance. Standing on the edge of the circle at mid-off, he times his jump perfectly, reaching out with his right hand above his head and grabbing a firm hold of the ball. But as he comes down, he loses his grip and Pandey gets a life. Blistering shot, going inside out over the off side, and there was just enough power for him to bat on"
10.6,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","he's deceived him in flight, making Pandey reach out, the hands well in front of the body, to meet the legbreak dipping sharply outside off. Still the man is in such good form that he manages to whack the ball - all along the ground - to long-on"
10.5,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run",stays back and nudges the flatter ball on leg stump through midwicket
10.4,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run",pulls a short ball turning into him to deep square leg
10.3,"Ashwin to Pandey, FOUR runs","sensational! It's a short ball outside off, but the put-away, the cut shot behind point, placed perfectly. There is nothing but timing on this shot. Not even a smidge of over-hitting. He's just that confident he can find the boundary with just touch play"
10.2,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","lovely, restrictive bowling. He chooses the googly. He pitches it on leg stump, the trajectory flat and the pace quick. Warner is thinking about a sweep but it's too quick for a flat-bat shot and so he can only dink it to midwicket"
10.1,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","straighter ball, skids into the right-hander on leg stump, Pandey shifts his weight back and flicks through midwicket"
9.6,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","full, just outside off, and driven to long on for a single"
9.5,"Ashwin to Pandey, 2 runs","length ball, wide outside off, and he flat-bats a pull to long on"

9.3,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off, and punched to point"
9.2,"Ashwin to Pandey, no run","full, just outside off, and he carves this towards cover point. Wants the single, but Warner sends him back"
9.1,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off, and cut square to deep point"
8.6,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","length ball, on middle, and turning away. Cut to point"
8.5,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","full, wide outside off, and he drags an attempted slog to cow corner. Mistimed to deep midwicket"
8.4,"Ashwin to Pandey, no run","full, just outside off, and pushed inside-out to cover"
8.3,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","full outside leg stump, and muscled away to deep midwicket"
8.2,"Ashwin to Warner, 2 runs","length ball on leg, and turning into his pads. Nudged to square leg, and Warner wants the second run. Can be dangerous since the fielder throws this in flat towards the keeper's end, but Warner's dive saves him despite some tidy work from Prabhsimran. A sharp double. Miller the fielder there"
8.1,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","full on middle, and Pandey plays another inside-out drive past Murugan's left. Long-off cleans up"
7.6,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","length ball outside off, and turning away further. The googly is cut away to point"
7.5,"Ashwin to Pandey, FOUR runs","whipped inside-out over cover What a shot. Full on off, and Pandey uses his bottom hand to lift this over the infield. Just beats long-off running to his left"
7.4,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","full on leg, and tapped with soft hands to the vacant midwicket region. Ashwin runs across the ground to intercept and stop the double"
7.3,"Ashwin to Warner, no run","length ball, from around the wicket. Landing on off and angling in further. Warner makes room, and cuts square, but can't find the gap"
7.2,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off, and Pandey backs away before playing a square-cut to deep point"
7.1,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","tossed up, drifted into middle, and turning away from Warner after pitching. Pushed to long off for one"
7.1,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 wide","length ball, from around the wicket, but landing on middle. Angles down the leg side"
6.6,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","full on leg, and tapped towards the leg side for a single. Warner wants two, but the fielder - KL Rahul - at the deep does well to drill a flat throw in"
6.6,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 wide","full, wide outside leg again, and Warner misses the attempted slog-sweep again. Hits the keeper's pads and rolls away to the leg side"
6.6,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 wide","full, wide outside leg stump, and Warner misses the attempted sweep"
6.5,"Ashwin to Warner, no run","full on off, and the legbreak is tapped to cover"
6.4,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","short, wide outside off, and Pandey muscles a cut in front of square to deep extra cover"
6.3,"Ashwin to Pandey, no run","length ball on off, and the googly comes into Pandey's body. Hits him near the pads, but impact outside leg stump"
6.2,"Ashwin to Saha, OUT","Kings XI review? No, umpire Nandan raises his finger very late! Length ball on middle, but turning away from Saha as he misses an attempted drag-pull. Ball takes a touch off the bat's bottom, and Prabhsimran takes a sharp low catch. They appeal, but the umpire first says no. M Ashwin wants to review, and now the umpire eventually raises his finger very late. A bit of confusion in the middle before Saha makes his way back"
6.1,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","length ball, outside leg stump and turning into middle. Warner mistimes a slog-pull to Gayle at square leg"
5.6,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","full on leg, slightly quicker. Nudged to square leg for a single"
5.5,"Ashwin to Saha, 1 run","full on off, and drilled to min-on for a single"
5.4,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","length ball on leg, and Warner looks to switch his grip before eventually playing the conventional flick to the leg side. Warner's twitch is keeping Ashwin on his toes"
5.3,"Ashwin to Saha, 1 run","full on leg, and clipped away to the vacant square-leg region for a single"
5.2,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","length ball on leg, and turning across the batsman. Pulled to deep midwicket"
5.1,"Ashwin to Warner, SIX runs","full on leg, but Warner makes room expecting the cramped line. Swivels and slog-sweeps behind square, and the ball flies over the square-leg fence. What a shot!"
4.6,"Shami to Saha, SIX runs","dragged away to deep midwicket! Sublime from Saha. Length ball on off, angling into Saha's body, and he whips this off his hips to deposit the ball into the stands. Take that, Shami. A strike-rate of 260 for Saha"
4.5,"Shami to Saha, FOUR runs","short-arm jab! Full on middle, and he picks this from near his toes and deposits it into the wide long-on fence"
4.4,"Shami to Warner, 1 run","Warner escapes! Back of a length on off, and he taps it towards the leg side. Saha's halfway down the wicket before Warner chooses to run. Mujeeb runs across from midwicket to try and throw Warner's stumps down  but he fails to gather the ball."
4.3,"Shami to Saha, 1 run","length ball, that nagging length just outside off, and Saha cleverly opens the bat's face to run this down to deep point"
4.2,"Shami to Warner, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and he mistimes a flat-batted pull. Ball rolls along to mid-off as they run across for one"
4.1,"Shami to Warner, no run","full on off and angling away. Warner looks to hammer this through the offside, and mistimes to mid-off"
3.6,"Mujeeb to Saha, FOUR runs","paddled! Full on middle, and he goes down on one knee before playing a very fine sweep! Ball races along the grass, and into the fine-leg boundary for the team fifty"
3.5,"Mujeeb to Warner, 1 run","full on middle, and tapped past the non-striker to long on. Mujeeb's attempted dive can't stop the ball, so Warner walks across for a single"
3.4,"Mujeeb to Warner, no run","full, just outside off, and driven to mid-off. No chance of a single this time"
3.3,"Mujeeb to Warner, FOUR runs","full on middle, and Warner backs away exposing all three stumps. Muscles a drive over cover thereafter, and that's a couple of bounces into the wide long-off fence"
3.2,"Mujeeb to Warner, FOUR runs","full on leg stump, and Warner goes down on one knee! Slog-sweeps behind square, and there's a huge gap near fine leg"
3.2,"Mujeeb to Warner, 5 wide","length ball drifting in, landing on middle, and going down leg. Warner flicks it past the keeper's left this time, and the ball races away for four. Could Prabhsimran have stopped that?"
3.1,"Mujeeb to Warner, no run","full on middle, and Warner backs away before driving to cover. Stopped by Pooran, who throws the ball towards the keeper. The ball flies over Prabhsimran again, but fine leg was backing up"
2.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Saha, 4 byes","poor from Prabhsimran! Offcutter on middle, and the ball goes under Saha's attempted swing and on the bounce to the keeper. But Prabhsimran fails to gauge the bounce, and it goes through him for four byes. The extra ball, thanks to the wide earlier, eventually hurts Kings XI"
2.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, 1 run","length ball on off, and the attempted cut takes an inside edge to square leg. Warner surprised by the extra nip off the deck"
2.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Saha, 1 run","length ball on middle, but slower from Arshdeep. Saha splices an attempted cut back towards the bowler and the batsmen scamper across for a single"
2.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Saha, 1 wide","back of a length on leg stump, and Saha allows the ball to soar over his head. Wide called by umpire Nandan"
2.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Saha, FOUR runs","full on middle, and Saha allows the ball to angle across him but then swings across the line to drag a boundary to the midwicket fence! Smartly picked up"
2.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, 1 leg bye","length ball on middle, but angling into Warner's body. Hits his thigh-guard and dribbles away to short fine leg"
2.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Saha, 3 runs","caressed! Length ball, angling across, and he rides the bounce to punch a shot through the off side. M Ashwin, from cover, gives the ball a mighty chase"
1.6,"Mujeeb to Warner, no run","full on leg stump, and he can't nudge it square. Ball hits his front leg, but impact is outside leg stump"
1.5,"Mujeeb to Warner, SIX runs","full, wide outside off, and Warner stretches towards the pitch of the ball before hoicking an inside-out drive over long off! Smacked for six"
1.4,"Mujeeb to Saha, 1 run","length ball on off, and straightening after pitching. Tries to work it towards midwicket, but leading edge makes the ball fly to point instead"
1.3,"Mujeeb to Saha, 2 runs","drifter that lands full on middle. Flicked off his toes to deep midwicket, and Saha calls loudly for the double"
1.2,"Mujeeb to Warner, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and he sticks his bat out to tap it towards point. Scampers across for one"
1.1,"Mujeeb to Warner, no run","full, from around the wicket. Lands on middle, and tapped back to Mujeeb"
0.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, 1 run","length ball on middle, and angling into his gut. Worked off his chest to square leg for a single"
0.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, FOUR runs","full toss, wide outside leg stump, and Warner has no trouble in nudging it fine off his hips for a boundary! Nobody at fine leg, Arshdeep has been very wayward after two exciting deliveries first up"
0.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, no run","full on off, and check-driven to cover. Rahul runs across to intercept"
0.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, FOUR runs","first runs off the bat! Searching for the swing again, and going full on middle. This time it angles down leg, and Warner comfortably flicks this past the keeper for four"
0.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, 1 wide","full, on middle, but going down leg. First runs"
0.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, no run","full on middle-off, and swinging away oh-so-slightly. He tentatively pushes forward to block once again"
0.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, no run","yorker from the left-arm pacer. Landing just at the base of off stump, and Warner does well to dig this away. A bit of swing away from Warner too. Yum"
19.6,"Chawla to Barinder Sran, 1 run","short of a length on off stump, pulled to deep midwicket"
19.5,"Chawla to Chahar, 1 run","length on off stump, driven on the rise to long-off"
19.4,"Chawla to Krunal, OUT","gets him! At long last, some individual happiness for Chawla. And it is compounded by the fact that this is his 150th in the IPL. He's been effective for KKR for a long, long time, but it's been tough going tonight. Beats Krunal with a googly again. Gets the top edge on his slog sweep and this time he takes it himself, running backwards"
19.3,"Chawla to Krunal, SIX runs","connects. The night is long for Mr. Chawla. Length outside off, reaches out and slugs it over the wide long-on boundary"
19.2,"Chawla to Krunal, no run","googly at a length on middle stump, steps out and lifts it over the bowler. Won't run"
19.1,"Chawla to Krunal, no run","beaten. Googly at a length wide outside off. Looks for the slog sweep, beaten"
18.6,"Russell to Barinder Sran, no run","beats him. Slower ball at a length in the corridor. Swings across the line, the ball hasn't arrived. It trickles through to Karthik"
18.5,"Russell to Barinder Sran, 2 runs","short ball at leg stump, pulled to deep square's right"
18.4,"Russell to Krunal, 1 run","low full toss on middle stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
18.3,"Russell to Krunal, no run","length and wide outside off, slashes at it and misses"
18.2,"Russell to Krunal, no run","yorker just outside off, looks to drive, beaten"
18.1,"Russell to Krunal, 2 runs",
17.6,"Gurney to Pandya, OUT","taken at deep midwicket! Andre Russell holds on to end a manic, outlandish, outrageous little big knock from Hardik Pandya. Make no mistake, it was an innings of pure genius. But Gurney's slower ball does him this time. He slices the attempted pull and it is taken calmly at the line"
17.5,"Gurney to Pandya, no run","full slower ball outside off, pushed into the covers"
17.4,"Gurney to Pandya, FOUR runs",wow! Squeezes this yorker out and manages to find four at the cover boundary! Full outside off and he carves it over cover point to get into the nineties
17.3,"Gurney to Pandya, SIX runs","see ya! Overpitched on the legs with that angle. Clears the long leg boundary, like he will in this form"
17.2,"Gurney to Krunal, 1 run","slower ball at middle, dragged into the leg side off the inside half"
17.1,"Gurney to Krunal, no run","full slower ball outside off, slogs and is beaten on the inside edge"
16.6,"Narine to Pandya, 2 runs","length ball wide outside off, shuffles and slogs on the up. Gill does superbly at long-on. Sprints, dives to his right, puts his shoulder at risk. But he keeps it in"
16.5,"Narine to Krunal, 1 run","full on middle stump, mistimed slog to long-on"
16.4,"Narine to Pandya, 1 run","length, sliding outside off. Mistimed punch cleaned up by a straight mid-off fielder"
16.3,"Narine to Pandya, no run","floater at a length, away from off stump. Beaten on the cut"
16.2,"Narine to Pandya, SIX runs","clears midwicket. AGAIN. Full ball at leg stump, now stride, no backlift. Just a whip of the wrists, again, with a dash of helicopter"
16.1,"Narine to Pandya, FOUR runs","lofts it over the bowler and reaches down to grab his toe. His hamstrings must be cramping. Length ball outside off, reaches out and gets a proper connection on it"
15.6,"Chawla to Pandya, 1 run",length and turning in from outside off. A subdued chop into the covers
15.5,"Chawla to Pandya, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, waits on it and crunches it over extra cover. Anyone else really feeling for Chawla right now?"
15.4,"Chawla to Pandya, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, smashed to the cover boundary off the back foot"
15.3,"Chawla to Pandya, 4 byes","121kph zinger from what must be a furious Chawla. It doesn't get better, I'm afraid. Past Hardik's pull, off DK's elbow and into the boundary"
15.2,"Chawla to Krunal, 1 run","dropped! No ""mine"" and no ""pinnadi po"" between DK and Uthappa here as they collide and put one down. Oh, poor Chawla. Tosses it up slowly, a googly. Krunal goes for the slog sweep, top edges into the covers. Uthappa under it finds DK in his face at the last moment"
15.1,"Chawla to Krunal, SIX runs","full and just outside off, and the entire family will hit Chawla over the leg side tonight if they have the chance. Pushed through flat and drilled straight over the bowler"
14.6,"Russell to Krunal, 1 run",full and just outside off. Mistimed slog out to long-on
14.5,"Russell to Pandya, 1 run","yorker length just outside off, shuffles and jams it down to long-on"
14.4,"Russell to Krunal, 1 run",bouncer up at the grille. Hooks hurriedly and is out of shape. It lobs out towards deep midwicket
14.3,"Russell to Pandya, 1 run","yorker just outside off, jammed down to long-on"
14.2,"Russell to Krunal, 1 run","short of a length in the corridor, chopped to third man"
14.1,"Russell to Krunal, 2 runs",slower short ball in the corridor. Gets on top of it and pulls to deep midwicket's left

13.3,"Narine to Pandya, SIX runs","17-ball fifty! Dropped short, turning into leg stump. He's not missed that shot once tonight and he has no problem sending this high over the deep midwicket fielder"
13.2,"Narine to Pollard, OUT","taken at deep square! Narine comes in and is assisted with some quality from Nitish Rana. Length ball, slightly slowed up. Pollard reaches out and swishes at this. It comes off the inside half and is getting low at Rana who sprints quickly enough not to let it go below waist height and then watches it into his hands. Keeps the balance and holds on"
13.1,"Narine to Pollard, no run","short of a length and turning in at middle, cramped and pushes it back down the pitch"
12.6,"Gurney to Pandya, no run","full toss outside off and he mistimes a drive, straight to mid-off"
12.5,"Gurney to Pandya, FOUR runs","full toss, wide outside off. Reach out, get a little bit of your amazing bat on it. Get it over cover. That's the formula, Hardik's nailed it"
12.4,"Gurney to Pollard, 1 run","full toss on off stump, driven to long-off"
12.3,"Gurney to Pandya, 1 run","full on middle, flicked to deep square"
12.2,"Gurney to Pandya, SIX runs","whipped over the square leg boundary! Stay put, people. Hardik has the skill, and tonight he has the license. Shuffles across and gives this a bit of helicopter to pick it up from off stump"
12.1,"Gurney to Pollard, 1 run","full and pushed across off stump, driven along the turf to long-off"
11.6,"Chawla to Pandya, SIX runs","over deep backward square. This is poor and a little hard to fathom from Chawla. He's feeding a leg side swing and taking his variations out of the picture, not to mention the lbw itself. He's also dropping it short, and Pandya in this form will pull him over the boundary every time"
11.5,"Chawla to Pollard, 1 run","length on middle, punched to long-on off the back foot"
11.4,"Chawla to Pandya, 1 run","short of a length at middle, pulled to deep midwicket"

11.2,"Chawla to Pandya, 1 run","short of a length on middle stump, whipped to long-on off the back foot"
11.1,"Chawla to Pandya, SIX runs","punched over the midwicket boundary. Chawla, on the defensive, around the wicket and bowling short on the leg stump. It was bound to go there"

10.5,"Narine to Pollard, 1 run","length outside off, tapped through cover"
10.4,"Narine to Pandya, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven down to long-on"
10.3,"Narine to Pandya, SIX runs","looked so easy! Length ball turning in at middle stump, gets low and sweeps on the rise without going on his knees. Clears midwicket"
10.2,"Narine to Pollard, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, punched to deep midwicket off the back foot"
10.1,"Narine to Pollard, FOUR runs","flicked to deep square's left. Full on the pads, half a stride and pick-up off the toe-end of the bat"

9.5,"Chawla to Pollard, FOUR runs","length outside off, punched off the backfoot and beats deep cover to his left"
9.4,"Chawla to Pandya, 1 leg bye","googly from around the wicket, spins back into the pads, as Hardik gives himself room, hurries onto him a little as well, leg bye down to short third-man"
9.3,"Chawla to Pandya, SIX runs","length on middle, not quite under the bat but Hardik just clears his front leg a little and extends his arms to clear long-on with ease"
9.2,"Chawla to Pandya, no run","full and flat, angled in, pushed back to the bowler"
9.1,"Chawla to Pandya, SIX runs","full and in the slot, Hardik hammers it flat and hard over the bowler's head for six"

8.3,"Russell to Pollard, 1 run","full on middle, drilled down the ground"
8.2,"Russell to Yadav, OUT","leading edge and taken by the keeper! It was a full toss but slower ball that dipped appreciably, Suryakumar had his hands way in front of the body there and was early into the flick that had earned him a couple of sixes and a four, but he was deceived comprehensively on that occasion as it went high up in the air and the keeper took it with ease"
8.1,"Russell to Yadav, SIX runs","length on middle, Suryalkumar uses his wrists to drag it towards squareleg, no flourish of the bat and it sails over deep squareleg"
7.6,"Sandeep to Yadav, 1 run","full toss outside off, driven to deep cover again"

7.4,"Sandeep to Yadav, 1 run","full outside off, crunched straight to deep cover"

7.1,"Sandeep to Pollard, 1 run","full outside off, Pollard goes for the big booming drive but only gets an outside edge to third-man"
6.6,"Russell to Yadav, FOUR runs","length outside off, Suryakumar runs it down to third-man, deliberately placing it very fine, and the third-man fielder can't get there despite the dive to his left"
6.5,"Russell to Pollard, 1 run","short ball, that's a good one made to look even better by Pollard, fending awkwardly, flies down to third-man but falls well short"
6.4,"Russell to Pollard, no run","length on off, nearly chops it back on to the stumps as he looks to cut"
6.3,"Russell to Pollard, no run","full on off, pushed to cover"
6.2,"Russell to Pollard, no run","length outside off, left alone by Pollard"
6.1,"Russell to Lewis, OUT","and what a game he's having! Just ambles in and delivers it on a length, angles it across, pretty innocuous delivery and Lewis basically guides it into the hands of the keeper"
5.6,"Gurney to Lewis, 1 run","yorker on off, squeezes it out to the off side and they come through for a single to finish a pretty sedate Powerplay"
5.5,"Gurney to Lewis, FOUR runs","full outside off, Lewis throws his bat at it and clears the cover field"

5.2,"Gurney to Yadav, 1 run",full on the pads and clipped straight to deep squareleg
5.1,"Gurney to Yadav, FOUR runs","full on the pads and Suryalumar goes through his favourite leg side again, flicks again, this time in front of square and for four"

4.5,"Sandeep to Yadav, 1 run","length outside off, steered to third-man"
4.4,"Sandeep to Yadav, SIX runs",full on middle and Suryakumar flicks aerially with one leg almost off the ground and the timing's good to carry it over the ropes at deep squareleg

4.2,"Sandeep to Lewis, no run","slower ball, angled across, Lewis looks to pull but deceived and misses"

3.3,"Gurney to Rohit Sharma, OUT","length and angled in, Rohit tries to slog it to the leg side, seems to get an inside edge onto the pad, but given by the umpire. Rohit reviews. Seems to be no edge there and that spells trouble for Mumbai, as it would have clipped leg stump"

1.4,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","length on off, Rohit comes down the wicket and drags it to the on side, doesn't get the desired timing but beats long-on to his right"
1.3,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on middle, Rohit comes down the wicket and kicks it away"
1.2,"Narine to de Kock, OUT","perfect start for Knight Riders! Length on middle, cramping de Kock for room so he tries going for the slog sweep but the extra bounce means that he top edges it to that man again, Russell, who makes no mistake at deep squareleg"

0.2,"Sandeep to de Kock, 1 leg bye","length on the pads, de Kock can't whips it away to the leg side, takes it on the body, but comes through for a quick single"
0.1,"Sandeep to de Kock, no run",
19.6,"Malinga to Russell, SIX runs","and Russell makes it 232! The highest score of the season. Also his highest of the season. Length outside off. Lots of room. Poor bowling. Russell drills it over long-off, flat"
19.5,"Malinga to Russell, no run","yorker outside off, chopped to deep point"
19.4,"Malinga to Russell, no run","on the bounce to long-off and they won't run. That is a dangerous length from Malinga and he gets way with it. Length outside off, hammered on the up"
19.3,"Malinga to Russell, FOUR runs","under-edge bounces over the keeper!  Obviously he meant that. Length ball wide outside off, stays still and throws the hands at it. It bounces into the turf and clears the keeper"
19.2,"Malinga to Russell, FOUR runs",how'd he do that? Is possibly what Malinga is thinking as he looks for his captain on the field. There's a deep extra cover and a wide long-off. Russell bisects them with a drive
19.1,"Malinga to Russell, SIX runs",and now Russell. Overpitched ball on leg stump. Gets the front leg out of the way and slogs it over deep midwicket. Boring.
18.6,"Bumrah to Russell, 1 leg bye",short of a length and into his body as he's hurried on the pull again. Single stolen pitch side
18.5,"Bumrah to Russell, no run",on his backside! Bumrah with a sensational response. Bouncer follows him down leg side and he has to do superbly to get his face out of the way. Ends up on the floor as he attempts it
18.4,"Bumrah to Russell, SIX runs","two-handed forehand over extra cover. Length ball wide outside off, he's got this front leg in the air and he wallops this, flat over the extra cover boundary"
18.3,"Bumrah to Russell, FOUR runs","short of a length at leg stump, backs away and hurriedly swipes at it. Gets it off the inside half. Good result? No, deep square must retrieve this from the boundary padding to his left"
18.3,"Bumrah to Karthik, (no ball) 1 run",no-ball! Low full toss outside off and a mistimed drive to long-off. Everything went to plan there but his landing
18.2,"Bumrah to Russell, 1 run","yorker at leg stump, jammed out to long-on and that is fifty for Russell. In a season so bizarre that his 166 strike rate right now is making a lot of people feel let down"
18.1,"Bumrah to Russell, no run","yorker at off stump, can't do more than jam that back to the bowler"
18.1,"Bumrah to Russell, 1 wide","slower ball, short and very wide. Left alone"
17.6,"Pandya to Russell, 1 run",short ball jumps up at him and he can't get in position for the pull. The ball plops into the turf in the square leg region
17.5,"Pandya to Russell, SIX runs","upper cut! Bouncer, wide outside off. Third man is in, no risk in even attempting that shot"
17.4,"Pandya to Russell, no run","back to it. And executed well. Slower ball lobbed wide at a length. Backs away, jumps back at it. Beaten"
17.3,"Pandya to Russell, SIX runs",full toss on leg stump! Oh boy. Two balls of straying away from the plan and it's costed 12. Backs away and swipes it over deep midwicket
17.2,"Pandya to Russell, SIX runs","misses his length this time and Russell finally gets that pull away. Slower ball, short and turning in. Easy swing to clear deep midwicket"
17.1,"Pandya to Karthik, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length in the corridor. Dabbed to short third"
16.6,"Bumrah to Russell, no run","slower ball at a length wide outside off, lines up for the slog but is well beaten"
16.5,"Bumrah to Karthik, 1 run","low full toss outside off, mistimed drive to mid-off"
16.4,"Bumrah to Karthik, SIX runs",delicious! What lovely timing. The old Ponting launch over midwicket from just short of a length. Regular paced delivery and his swing is perfect under this
16.3,"Bumrah to Karthik, FOUR runs",looks like a slower ball and looks like DK has picked it perfectly. Short and wide outside off. Waits on it and pulls off the front foot to bisect deep square and deep midwicket
16.2,"Bumrah to Russell, 1 run",short and into the body. A muffled pull to long-on's right
16.1,"Bumrah to Karthik, 1 run","length outside off, driven on the rise to mid-off"
15.6,"Pandya to Russell, FOUR runs","lifts it over short third. Once again he's unsettled under the short one, but this one is dug in really short so there's time. The width helps too. He just guides it over the infield"
15.5,"Pandya to Karthik, 1 run","length just outside off, pushed to point's left with an open face"
15.4,"Pandya to Russell, 1 run","past the midwicket fielder inside the circle, who might be in there to catch the miscued pull. This is length, and he chips it past him towards deep midwicket"
15.3,"Pandya to Russell, no run",slower short ball outside off. The revs mean this ball grips and goes over Russell's attempted cut
15.2,"Pandya to Gill, OUT","taken at deep midwicket! At first it looks like he's sent this into the windshield of that Tesla floating in space, but gravity steps in. And then Evin Lewis. Slower ball, picked up from outside off, but taken a comfortable few inches inside the line"
15.1,"Pandya to Russell, 1 run",sliced but safely into the vacant mid-on region. Backing into the leg side and is late on the hook against a superbly directed short ball
14.6,"Malinga to Russell, 1 run","slower short ball wide outside off, cut straight to deep point"
14.5,"Malinga to Russell, no run","slower ball, short and wide outside off. Mistimed cut straight to short third"
14.4,"Malinga to Russell, FOUR runs",oh that's not a great option - length and very wide. Russell has the front foot into the leg side but he swishes hard and gets it past short third man
14.3,"Malinga to Gill, 1 run",yorker with late swing in at leg stump. Flicked through midwicket
14.2,"Malinga to Gill, FOUR runs",deft. Inswinging yorker at the toes. A shuffle and late bat down at it to clip it past short fine
14.1,"Malinga to Gill, FOUR runs",don't stick out your hand Lasith! Gill has picked the offcutter which is on a length outside off and spanked it on the up past the bowler's left. Long-off not even close
13.6,"Chahar to Russell, SIX runs","and another! Too flat, too similar. Length on off, no turn, clean swing on the slog sweep and it's over the fence"
13.5,"Chahar to Russell, SIX runs",nailed it! First of the night for Russell. Uses his reach to get closer to the pitch this time and absolutely carts this length ball over midwicket
13.4,"Chahar to Russell, no run",past off stump as Russell gets low for the slog sweep but doesn't get anywhere near the pitch
13.3,"Chahar to Gill, 1 run","length outside off, driven on the up to sweeper cover"
13.2,"Chahar to Gill, no run",inside edge onto boot. Slower and at a length outside off. Looks for the slog sweep
13.1,"Chahar to Gill, SIX runs",pumps it over the midwicket boundary! Length and pushed through fast. Lines it up and connects cleanly on the slog
13.1,"Chahar to Gill, 1 wide","length ball down leg side, beaten on the sweep"
12.6,"Pandya to Russell, no run","short and wide outside off, springs up and chucks his hands at this. Can't connect"
12.6,"Pandya to Russell, 1 wide","another slower ball, very very wide"
12.5,"Pandya to Russell, no run","yorker at off stump, opens the face and chops it straight to backward point"
12.5,"Pandya to Russell, 1 wide","slower ball, wide outside off, left alone"
12.4,"Pandya to Russell, no run",steep bouncer dipping back in towards Russell who takes a middle stump guard and a small step into the off side to counter Hardik's anticipated line. But this one comes back in at his body and he drops his bat to let it pass
12.4,"Pandya to Russell, 1 wide","slower offcutter, wide outside off. Left alone"

11.3,"Chahar to Russell, no run","length at middle stump, steps out and pokes it down the pitch"
11.2,"Chahar to Russell, FOUR runs",is that dropped? Chahar's zig-zag run-up has been followed by yet another miscued cross-batted shot. Russell's pull dips on Evin Lewis at deep midwicket and he gets some fingers under the ball but can't do it quickly enough

9.1,"Chahar to Gill, SIX runs","length outside off and that's an outrageously good shot over extra cover, just extends his arms through the ball and times it so well that it goes over the ropes"

7.2,"Axar Patel to Kohli, OUT","he's picked out the lone man in the deep! Short, Kohli rocks back and wallops the pull. Hit so well, so hard but Rutherford is lurking.

19.2,"Aaron to Bhuvneshwar, 4 byes",Samson's missed it Aaron dug in the slower bouncer and Bhuvi had to sway out of the way while trying to ramp it. Samson went to his left but the ball went under his glove

Shakib tries to fetch it from there and wants to pull it to midwicket, but it's a long boundary and he has to generate all the power himself.

17.6,"Thomas to Rashid Khan, no run",greeted by a snorting bouncer first up and he ducks well under it
17.5,"Thomas to Saha, OUT","Oshane's not going to be denied for long. Saha's been out of cricket for a while and a pacy, back of length ball that's zipping in from off is not the easiest to face. He was giving himself room to try and swat it into the legside, but gets a thin top edge that is held by Samson behind the stumps."
17.4,"Thomas to Saha, 2 runs","sitter dropped by Shreyas Gopal at fine leg that was a quick one that hurried on to Saha, who could only paddle it straight up in the air. It was going straight to Gopal, who fluffed it."

Hooda has no clue about it, way too early into the flick and he pops it in the air. It's flying above Unadkat but he times his jump perfectly in the follow through to pluck it with his left hand stretched out full, in the air. And he's pumped."
16.1,"Unadkat to Shakib, 1 run","put down by Aaron diving to his left at short fine Length ball outside off, Shakib walked way across his stumps and tried to flick it fine. Didn't time it, so the ball wasn't travelling fast. Aaron dived to his left and got hands to it, but couldn't hold on"

15.5,"Aaron to Shankar, OUT","taken by Unadkat running in from deep square leg Shankar hadn't looked fluent, and he gets a top edge to this intended pull.

15.1,"Aaron to Shankar, 1 run","great effort by Samson but puts the edge down Full ball and Vijay drives with feet not moving, it takes the outside edge. Samson flies to his right but can only get a glove to it, doesn't stick"
14.6,"Gopal to Pandey, OUT","we might have a stumping here Pandey waits on this and late cuts it, but seemed to lose balance and Samson broke the stumps. And that's brilliant work by Samson. He broke the stumps right when Pandey's foot was in the air. Oh wait, that's actually caught behind. Though it would have been stumped too. Pandey cut it so fine, it went into Samson's gloves and he held on. The batsman seemed to think about setting off for a run then decided against it, and in that process, lost balance. Samson broke the stumps at that precise moment too."
14.5,"Gopal to Pandey, FOUR runs","brilliance. Full ball on the stumps, bowled a bit quicker, Pandey gives himself room and carves it over extra cover for a peachy boundary"

12.3,"Thomas to Shankar, 1 run","back of a length on the stumps, Vijay is pushed on the back foot and he pats it back. They decide on the quick single and Riyan charges in from cover and has a shy, but Pandey is quick and would have been just home even with a direct hit"

11.4,"Binny to Pandey, no run","good length  on the stumps, pushed back to the bowler"
11.3,"Binny to Pandey, 2 runs","good fielding by Livingstone, pleasant change from the standards Royals have maintained in the field today. Short of a length outside off and Pandey slapped it over extra cover, almost tennis ball style from shoulder height. Livingstone made good ground and parried the ball in to save the boundary"
11.2,"Binny to Pandey, FOUR runs","drilled. Pandey must have faced a lot of Binny in the Karnataka nets, but anyone getting a half-volley on off would have put this away. Straight back past the bowler"

12.5,"Roy to Santner, no run","length ball on middle, and punched straight back. Sharp stop from Anukul diving to his right"
12.4,"Roy to Bravo, 1 run","full on leg, and whipped away to Krunal at sweeper on the leg side"
12.3,"Roy to Santner, 1 run","length ball on middle, and angling across. Punched down the ground to wide long off"
12.2,"Roy to Santner, no run","length ball on middle, and skidding through. Santner uncomfortably nudges it away to the leg side"
12.1,"Roy to Bravo, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off and turning further away. Dragged to deep midwicket for one"
11.6,"Bumrah to Santner, no run","back of a length, angling across, and Santner's attempted back-foot defense takes an outside edge, and very nearly carries into the keeper's gloves"
11.5,"Bumrah to Santner, no run","back of a length on middle, and he tiptoes to defend"
11.4,"Bumrah to Vijay, OUT","slower ball, wide outside off, and he steers a cut-shot straight to the fielder at point! Dives diagonally to his right to take the catch, but umpire Gaffaney Llong wants to check with the TV umpire if that's carried. Soft signal: out. Replays make things even more complicated. From some angles it looks like a bump-ball, from another angle it looks like the fingers are under the ball. Let's see what the TV umpire says. And he says that Suryakumar has taken a clean catch! Big blow for CSK."
11.3,"Bumrah to Bravo, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off, and slapped behind point to Anukul in the deep"
11.2,"Bumrah to Bravo, no run","back of a length, wide outside off but angling in. He covers his off stump, and blocks to the leg side"
11.1,"Bumrah to Vijay, 1 leg bye","appeal for lbw but not given. Length ball on off, angling in, and hitting the knee roll before rolling down to third man. But the ball would've missed leg stump"
10.6,"Chahar to Vijay, 1 run","half-tracker on off, and he backs away to flat-bat a shot down the ground. Ball goes through Chahar's fingers but there's protection at long off"
10.5,"Chahar to Vijay, no run","length ball, outside off and turning further away. Vijay tries to cut, but misses, and QdK quickly whips the bails off. They're checking for a stumping chance because Vijay had lost his balance while trying to play that shot. Replays suggest he's got something behind the line. Safe"
10.4,"Chahar to Bravo, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and turning away. Cut off the back foot to point for a swift single"
10.3,"Chahar to Bravo, no run","full on leg, and turning across the batsman. Defended off the back foot to the leg side"
10.2,"Chahar to Vijay, 1 run","full, just outside off, and driven gently past Chahar's left to long off"
10.1,"Chahar to Bravo, 1 run","full on off, and the googly spins inwards. Worked off his pads to the leg side"
9.6,"Roy to Shorey, OUT","drags it straight to long-on! Length on middle stump, steps out and is nowhere near the pitch of this. Swings across the line and has no control of this. Easily taken at the line"
9.6,"Roy to Shorey, 1 wide","length ball, down leg side and past the flick"
9.5,"Roy to Vijay, 1 run","length on middle stump, leans in and flicks to deep midwicket"
9.4,"Roy to Shorey, 1 run","tossed up at leg stump, steps out and flicks into the midwicket region"
9.3,"Roy to Vijay, 1 run","full on middle stump, jammed down to long-on"
9.2,"Roy to Shorey, 1 run","dropped! Second for Anukul, this time a much more difficult one. Shorey steps out and makes it a full toss before punching it firmly to Anukul's left. Bursts through his grasp"
9.2,"Roy to Shorey, 1 wide","length and down leg side, past the attempted paddle"
9.1,"Roy to Shorey, no run",beaten in flight but manages to defend to extra cover. Stepped out early against this length ball
9.1,"Roy to Shorey, 1 wide","length at middle, skids down leg and past the flick"
8.6,"Chahar to Vijay, 2 runs",Vijay survives a run-out call. Nudges this short of a length ball through the vacant square leg region. Comes back for the second. The throw is prompt and hard and Rohit does superbly to lunge low to his right and catch it before flicking it onto the stumps. Marginally in
8.5,"Chahar to Shorey, 1 run","missed run-out at the non-striker's end! Poor running from Shorey. Cuts to point and is caught ball watching. Vijay is nearly past him when he responds and there's time, because it's an easy single. But he then jogs, for some reason, not even trying to make it to his crease. Chahar picks up a poor throw and then makes a poor flick himself to miss the stumps. Just extremely ordinary cricket from everyone there"
8.4,"Chahar to Shorey, no run",beaten. Short and turning away outside off as he looks to pull
8.3,"Chahar to Vijay, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket where SKY keeps them to one"
8.2,"Chahar to Shorey, 1 run","length outside off, gets forward and gets a thick edge to backward point's left"

7.5,"Krunal to Vijay, no run","length outside off, defended to point on the front foot"
7.4,"Krunal to Vijay, no run","length just outside off, grips and turns as he looks to flick. Leading edge to the bowler"
7.3,"Krunal to Shorey, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked off the front foot to deep midwicket"
7.2,"Krunal to Jadhav, OUT","chopped it on! Arm ball again! A lot slower this time, but just as effective because it's short of a length. He gets on the back foot to try and play the late cut, but he's right in front of the stumps with an angled bat and he can only get it onto the stumps off the under-edge"
7.1,"Krunal to Jadhav, 2 runs","length outside off, gets forward and expertly nudges into the vacant midwicket region with soft hands"
6.6,"Chahar to Jadhav, 1 run",short and turning away outside off. Late cut to short third
6.5,"Chahar to Jadhav, no run","length and turning outside off, looks to chop, beaten"
6.4,"Chahar to Jadhav, no run","short of a length just outside off, hurriedly pushed back to the bowler"
6.3,"Chahar to Vijay, 1 run","full on off stump, driven with the turn to long-off"
6.2,"Chahar to Jadhav, 1 run","length on off stump, defended into the covers"
6.1,"Chahar to Jadhav, no run","short of a length and skidding on outside off, looks to cut and is beaten"
5.6,"Bumrah to Vijay, FOUR runs","just falls short of Krunal and the cruel price to pay for his ambition is that this ball trickles behind him into the backward square boundary. Short of a length and Vijay not in control of the pull. Too late on it and ends up lobbing it up in that direction. Krunal sprints in some 10-15 yards and dives forward wholeheartedly, but can't wrap his fingers around the ball"
5.5,"Bumrah to Vijay, no run",short of a length and skidding into the corridor. Stabbed to point off the back foot
5.4,"Bumrah to Vijay, no run","length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
5.3,"Bumrah to Jadhav, 1 run","offcutter, short of a length just outside off. Steered to third man with an angled bat"

5.1,"Bumrah to Jadhav, no run","length on off stump, defended solidly on the front foot"
4.6,"Krunal to Vijay, no run","appeal for lbw but no review. Length and skidding on. Vijay goes across the line, trying to pull. Cops this on the flap"
4.5,"Krunal to Vijay, no run","past the edge. Length outside off, looks to drive and is beaten"
4.4,"Krunal to Jadhav, 1 run","length outside off, closes the face and pushes to mid-on's right"
4.3,"Krunal to Rayudu, OUT","straight through him! That's the perfect arm ball if there is one. 99kph, skidding straight on and hitting the top of middle stump before Rayudu can gauge what's happened. He's driving for the turn, on the rise, outside off. It skids straight on"
4.2,"Krunal to Rayudu, no run","length on off stump, defended into the off side"
4.1,"Krunal to Rayudu, no run","full on leg stump, looks to flick and cops it on the pad"
3.6,"Pandya to Vijay, 2 runs","length outside off, driven on the rise. Extra cover dives to his right and parries it to mid-off's right. The latter has a lot of recovery to do after starting to sprint to his left"
3.5,"Pandya to Vijay, no run","offcutter at a length, cramping him and making him chop onto the body as he gets on the front foot"
3.4,"Pandya to Vijay, SIX runs","straight over the bowler! He was looking, perhaps, to go over mid-off. But he hasn't picked the slower ball from Pandya. Luckily for him, not too much pace off that ball and it pings off the middle with his extension and comfortably clears the straight boundary"
3.3,"Pandya to Vijay, FOUR runs","length on leg stump, allows it to come on and flicks aerially to the long leg boundary"
3.2,"Pandya to Vijay, no run","length at off stump, looks to punch at it, it doesn't come on. Stays on the pitch"
3.1,"Pandya to Raina, OUT","taken at point! Yikes, Raina looked completely out of sorts there. A couple of steps into the leg side, reaching out a long way to this length ball outside off and a aimless swipe from under it. Completely out of shape against what was a straight short ball. Slices and SKY takes it. Poor from the stand-in captain"
2.6,"Malinga to Vijay, 2 runs","dropped at point! Anukul Roy can't sort his position out quickly enough and lets a simple one go. Vijay looking for the chip again, this time to a full ball outside off. Ends up slicing it high. Roy has to take a couple of steps back. Might have slightly over-run because he has some adjusting to do as he stops his momentum and puts his hands out in front of his body and to the right. Straight through"
2.5,"Malinga to Vijay, no run","slower ball just outside off, blocked on the front foot"
2.4,"Malinga to Vijay, 2 runs","and another but not too much control this time. Length just outside off, offers the angled bat and it goes wide to third man's right"
2.3,"Malinga to Vijay, 2 runs","short of a length, checks the punch this time and offers a straighter bat to chip this over cover this time"
2.2,"Malinga to Vijay, FOUR runs","short of a length just outside off, shapes for the cut and has to check his shot as this grips in the pitch. Just chips it square, over point, and that's enough"
2.1,"Malinga to Raina, 1 run","thick edge down to third man. Length ball just outside off, reaches with hard hands and loses control against this slower ball"
1.6,"Krunal to Vijay, no run","length ball outside off, gets low and looks to sweep. Cops it on the pad, outside the line"
1.5,"Krunal to Vijay, no run","length at off stump, blocked on the front foot"
1.4,"Krunal to Vijay, no run","appeal for stumping. Big turn for Pandya to square Vijay up. His back leg rises but has he brought it back down in time? Looks like it yes, a toe and he's safe. This ball gripped and spun past the bat as he looked to play the flick"
1.3,"Krunal to Vijay, no run","length at off stump, tapped towards mid-off"
1.2,"Krunal to Raina, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked aerially to square leg's right"
1.1,"Krunal to Vijay, 1 run","length on off stump, tapped into the covers"
0.6,"Malinga to Raina, no run","full at off stump, blocked down the pitch"
0.5,"Malinga to Watson, OUT",straight to short fine! 'Are you kidding me?' is Watson's expression right now. A filthy overpitched ball down leg side. Looks to flick it and finds Rahul Chahar there
0.4,"Malinga to Watson, no run","short of a length and cramped at off stump. Looks to punch, can only get it back down the pitch"
0.3,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR runs","short of a length on the pads, stays deep in the crease and tucks it to short fine's right"
0.2,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR runs",shot! That is crisp. Short of a length with some shape away and he gets his weight right onto the back foot and punches it between cover and extra
0.1,"Malinga to Vijay, 1 run","length and curved away in the corridor. On the back foot to defend, gets a thick edge down to third man"
19.6,"Bravo to Pandya, 2 runs","overpitched, wide outside off, and drilled to deep point. Mumbai finish on 155 for 4"
19.5,"Bravo to Pandya, SIX runs","hammered! Slower ball, full outside off, but Hardik's picked the change of pace. Drags this shot across the sline, and the ball flies over the long-on fence"
19.4,"Bravo to Pandya, FOUR runs","and Pollard ducks for cover now! Low full toss on off, and Hardik swings across the line to bludgeon a flat-batted shot to the long-on boundary"
19.3,"Bravo to Pandya, no run","yorker, outside the tramlines, but Hardik's walked across to the off side, so it isn't called a wide. Hardik, for his part, could not connect with the attempted slice"
19.2,"Bravo to Pollard, 1 run","full toss, wide outside off, and he mistimes a shot to long off. Hit flat to Jadhav this time"
19.1,"Bravo to Pollard, FOUR runs","boom! The umpire ducks for cover. Full, wide outside off, and he flat-bats a shot over Bravo's head. Lands just inside the long-off boundary"
18.6,"Chahar to Pandya, no run","left alone by Hardik, despite it being just a length delivery. Maybe he expected the ball to bounce some more, but it didn't, and that's a free dot ball added to Deepak Chahar's account"
18.5,"Chahar to Pollard, 1 run","back of a length, wide outside off, and he drags a pull to deep midwicket. Pollard wants two, but Hardik says no"
18.4,"Chahar to Pollard, 2 runs","full on leg stump, and Pollard can't whip this away. Hits his boot and rolls away to square leg"
18.3,"Chahar to Pollard, FOUR runs","length ball just outside off, and Pollard drags a pulled shot behind square to the fine leg boundary! Not a convincing shot, but Pollard won't mind it at this stage"
18.2,"Chahar to Pandya, 1 run","sliced but drops short of Raina running in from cover. This was a short ball that Hardik couldn't get on top of due to the extra bounce. But wait, Raina has hurt himself trying to field. He hobbles across the ground before falling onto the ground. Looks like he's put some extra pressure on his ankle."
18.1,"Chahar to Pandya, 2 runs","back of a length on middle, and he muscles a pull to deep midwicket. Enough time to scamper back for the second"
17.6,"Bravo to Pollard, no run","overpitched, wide outside off again, and Pollard lets it go! Thought that was beyond the tram-lines, but wasn't"
17.5,"Bravo to Pandya, 1 run","slower ball, very wide outside off, and Hardik flat-bats a shot to long on. Would've been a wide had Hardik left the ball"
17.4,"Bravo to Pandya, 2 runs","length ball, wide outside off, and he slices a cut down to deep point. But Imran Tahir slides across the ground, and dives across it to save a four. Gets an applause from fellow senior statesman Shane Watson"
17.4,"Bravo to Pandya, 1 wide","full, very wide outside off, and Hardik lets it go. Collects the extra run"
17.3,"Bravo to Pollard, 1 run","length ball, slower ball, wide outside off. Pollard mistimes a cut in front of square to wide long on"
17.2,"Bravo to Pollard, no run","back of a length, wide outside off, but this is the slower ball too. Pollard walks across to the off side, but misses, completely deceived by the lack of pace. Rayudu throws the ball over Pollard's head, and nearly hits the back of the batsman's head. Luckily it doesn't, and Rayudu and Pollard share a smile"
17.1,"Bravo to Pandya, 1 run","full, wide outside off, and he bends his knees to drill a straight drive to long off"
16.6,"Santner to Pollard, no run","full outside off, and Pollard shapes up to deposit this over the bowler's head. But the extra turn deceives the batsman, and the delivery goes through to the keeper"
16.5,"Santner to Pollard, no run","full on middle, and Pollard takes a big stride forward to block this ball away"
16.4,"Santner to Pollard, no run","full on middle, and he drills a drive straight. Stopped by Santner"
16.3,"Santner to Pollard, no run","length ball, just outside off, and turning away after pitching. Uncomfortably defended with soft hands towards the off side"
16.2,"Santner to Rohit Sharma, OUT","holes out! Full, but slower through the air. Lands on leg stump, and Rohit makes room to clear long on. Hits this well, but he's through the shot a tad too early. Vijay takes an easy catch at long on. Excellent spell from Santner tonight!"
16.1,"Santner to Pandya, 1 run","back of a length on off, and the ball takes some extra bounce. Hardik punches off the back foot to long on"
15.6,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","just over the boundary! Full, on off, and Rohit gets down on one knee to have a swing at it. Mistimes the slow-sweep, but still has enough power behind that shot to clear the boundary line"
15.5,"Tahir to Pandya, 1 run","length ball on off, but the googly turns sharply into Hardik's pads. Whipped away to backward square leg"
15.4,"Tahir to Pandya, no run","overpitched on off, and he muscles a straight drive back to the bowler. Tahir does well to get a hand to it"
15.3,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","what happened there? Back of a length, just outside off, and Rohit skips down the wicket. He has to adjust, and he gloves an attempted cut to the vacant first-slip region"
15.2,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","full on leg, and drifting into his pads. Rohit gets his front foot out of the way, and swings over to the leg side. A couple of bounces and into the wide long-on boundary"
15.1,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","half-tracker on middle, and Rohit rocks back to pull off the back foot. Mistimed to the leg side, but in the gap between deep midwicket and deep backward square. Ball dribbles into the fence"
14.6,"Santner to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full, just outside off, and he check-drives to wide long off. Another tidy over from Mitch Santner"
14.5,"Santner to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on middle, and he presses forward to block the ball back"
14.4,"Santner to Pandya, 1 run","full, just outside off, and he drills a drive to wide extra cover for a single"
14.3,"Santner to Pandya, no run","another one! Full outside off, and turning away from Hardik. Looks to drive, but misses. Ball whizzes past his outside edge again"
14.2,"Santner to Pandya, no run","how did that miss off stump? Full on middle, and Hardik looks to defend with the straight bat. But the ball turns away, flies past his outside edge and nearly clips off stump"
14.1,"Santner to Pandya, no run","full on middle, and turning away from Hardik after hitting the surface. Looks to work it towards the leg side, but leading edge takes it to point instead"
13.6,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on middle, and Rohit carefully fends with soft hands to see the over out. Another timeout"
13.5,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, no run","full, just outside off, and defended back to Tahir"
13.4,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, no run","drops just short of cover! Full outside off, and turning away. Rohit presses forward to defend, but the ball pops into the air. Raina dives forward, but the ball lands just in front of him"
13.3,"Tahir to Pandya, 1 run","full on off, and driven down the ground to long off for a jogging single"
13.2,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length ball on off, and the googly turns inwards. He's on the back foot, and works it off his hips to midwicket"
13.1,"Tahir to Krunal, OUT","full on middle, and Krunal goes down on his knees to try and slog a sweep. Mistimes the shot, and the ball pops in the air. Santner at deep midwicket takes a simple catch. Another failure for Krunal"
12.6,"Santner to Krunal, 1 run","full on leg, and Krunal skips down the wicket to meet the ball. Muscled over square leg, but there's protection there in the deep"
12.5,"Santner to Krunal, no run","full on off, and he takes a big stride forward to work the ball towards the leg side"
12.4,"Santner to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full on middle, and he drives to cover's right for a quick single. Fifty for Rohit, his first of IPL 2019. A sedate celebration"
12.3,"Santner to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on middle, and he pushes this to short cover once again"
12.2,"Santner to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on leg stump, and he pushes an inside-out drive to mid off"
12.1,"Santner to Lewis, OUT","it's high, but not long enough! Full on leg stump, and Lewis looks to swing across the line. Slices the shot, and while the ball has the elevation, it doesn't quite have the distance. Bravo safe as houses at deep midwicket"
11.6,"Bravo to Rohit Sharma, no run","yorker on middle, and Rohit does well to keep this away. Rohit wants the single, but Bravo's quick to intercept"
11.5,"Bravo to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","ramped over the keeper! Back of a length, not quick enough, and Rohit opens the bat's face before helping the ball over Rayudu"
11.4,"Bravo to Rohit Sharma, no run",
11.3,"Bravo to Lewis, 1 run","length ball angling across Lewis, and he mistimes an attempted cut to Santner at deep point"
11.2,"Bravo to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length ball on off stump, angling into Rohit. Drilled down the ground to Chahar at long on for a walking single"
11.1,"Bravo to Lewis, 1 run","slower ball gone wrong as the ball dips on Lewis. Nearly a waist-high full toss, and that's been nudged away to square leg"

10.5,"Santner to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full toss on middle, and driven down to the bowler. Parries the ball away to mid-off"
10.4,"Santner to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","full, wide outside off, and he slaps a drive square past point. Fielder in the deep is nowhere close"
10.3,"Santner to Rohit Sharma, no run","length ball outside off, and the ball turns away from Rohit. Tries to tap it towards the off side, but it's under-edged to point"
10.2,"Santner to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","full on leg, and he puts his front leg across the ball, before paddling this to Tahir at fine leg"
10.1,"Santner to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on off, and turning away from Rohit as he pushes forward to defend. Ball whizzes past his outside edge, and Rayudu collects this well"

8.6,"Tahir to Lewis, 1 run","full outside off, sliced to sweeper's left"
8.5,"Tahir to Lewis, FOUR runs","off the inside half but enough on this. It's straight once more and that's what gets him the runs. Slower and turning a touch, but the straight loft beats long-on to his right"
8.4,"Tahir to Lewis, SIX runs","straight over the bowler. Full, pushed through and in his zone, like a throwdown. Stays put and gets his hands through this smoothly"
8.3,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length on off stump, looks to sweep, gets a leading edge that takes it to long-on"
8.2,"Tahir to Lewis, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punched to sweeper cover"

7.5,"Harbhajan to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length at middle stump, nudged through midwicket off the back foot"
7.4,"Harbhajan to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","pumps it over long-on! Stunning connection. Rohit is looking sublime so far. Harbhajan pushing it flat now after that first six and that means he can step out and get some pace on it. And he does, and he launches it over the sightscreen"
7.3,"Harbhajan to Rohit Sharma, no run","length on off stump, pushed to short third off the outside half"
7.2,"Harbhajan to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","lifts it over the deep midwicket boundary! Tossed up at middle stump, steps out, not quite to the pitch but goes through and drags it, high but wide enough of the fielder running to his left"

6.1,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full outside off, gets down, paddles to long leg"
5.6,"Harbhajan to Lewis, no run","big turn to go past the outside edge. Lovely line. Just outside off, dipping at a length. The ball he bowled to get Narine earlier this season if you remember. Lewis looks to defend, isn't close as it rises as well. Oh hang on! Replays show there was an edge on that! None of the CSK players noticed."

5.2,"Harbhajan to Rohit Sharma, no run",onto his throat but not sure if there was a top edge on that. Loopy length delivery outside off and Rohit can't get the sweep away
5.1,"Harbhajan to Lewis, 3 runs","short of a length slider at middle stump. Shuffles, goes deep in the crease and swishes an angled bat at this. Gets it off the inside part and past short fine"
4.6,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","finds the gap. Chahar's inconsistent lines have been punished this over. This is short, regular pace and at leg stump. At his regular pace, that's an invitation for an easy pull. Rohit accepts and puts it wide of short fine"
4.5,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs",slower short ball outside off. Waits on it and drags the pull to deep square's left
4.4,"Chahar to Lewis, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, turned to fine leg"
4.3,"Chahar to Lewis, FOUR runs","inside edge past Rayudu. Short and slanted across him. Chucks his hands at it, doesn't time it very well"

3.5,"Harbhajan to Lewis, no run","short of a length on off stump, makes room and chops straight to point"
3.4,"Harbhajan to Lewis, no run",big appeal for lbw as he misses the sweep again. This one is possibly turning past off stump. Or so CSK might think. They don't review. Struck him in front of off stump

2.6,"Chahar to Lewis, no run","short of a length at the thigh, looks to pull but misses again. Lobs on the bounce to short fine"
2.5,"Chahar to Lewis, no run","beaten and off balance. Not quite in the boxing sense. It's a juicy, straight overpitched ball with a lot of width, but Lewis' feet are cemented and his hands aren't close enough to connect"
2.4,"Chahar to de Kock, OUT","got him with another slower ball! QDK is too early on yet another shot. This one isn't a knuckle ball, it's more visibly a proper offbreak that is slammed in, back of a length. He wants to turn it to deep square but gets a top edge that Rayudu pockets gratefully"
2.4,"Chahar to de Kock, 1 wide","slower bouncer dug in a bit too short. QDK watches it sail over his head, down leg side"
2.3,"Chahar to de Kock, no run","knuckle ball hits him on the pads as he looks to flick. Too early on that length ball, is QDK"
2.2,"Chahar to de Kock, FOUR runs","looks like a misfield or at the very least half an effort from extra cover. Length outside off, leans in on the front foot, down on his knees as he drives with an extension of his arms. Tahir sticks out a reluctant hand and lets it pass"
2.1,"Chahar to de Kock, SIX runs","smoked. Short of a length at off stump and he takes a couple of steps down before swiping from underneath it. On the rise, over the square leg boundary"

1.1,"Harbhajan to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short of a length at middle stump, dropped into the midwicket region with soft hands"
0.6,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, tapped to extra cover's left on the rise"
0.5,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, no run","beaten. Short of a length, a little more climb than before. Chases and looks to slice. Late on it and some work for Rayudu in the first over"
0.4,"Chahar to de Kock, 3 runs","shot. Overpitched and no shape back in this time. QDK reaches out and drills it between extra and mid-off. Extra cover gets a hand though and Vijay chases, slides, and pulls it back. Looking sharp off the bench"
0.3,"Chahar to de Kock, no run",short of a length and swung in at off stump. Hurriedly tapped to point with an open face
0.2,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short of a length outswinger wide outside off, opens the face and runs it down to third man"

19.2,"Prasidh to Archer, SIX runs","Archer's done it! His final act in IPL 2019 is hitting an extra cover drive off a full ball for six, while giving himself room. Full ball and he shows his extraordinary timing, and sending it zipping through the air and over the boundary. Pick him for the World Cup already, England! Just do it."
19.1,"Prasidh to Archer, FOUR runs","outside edge flies for four! Length ball outside off, Archer goes really hard at it, wanted to go over extra cover, but it takes the edge and goes to third man"
18.6,"Russell to Unadkat, no run","length ball on the stumps, swiped, but gets it only till mid-off"
18.5,"Russell to Parag, OUT","oh dear he's out hit-wicket. Short ball and he was moving inside the line to pull it fine, but doesn't connect with the ball. In the follow through his bat hits the top of the stumps. unfortunate end to an impressive innings."
18.4,"Russell to Parag, SIX runs","Riyan Parag is turning it on He's a teenager and he's just hit IPL 2019's MVP for a six over long-on, even though it wasn't perfectly timed. Own medicine and all that for Russell. Brathwaite at long-on was interested and leapt up, but the ball went over him"
18.3,"Russell to Archer, 1 run","pacy short ball, Archer goes to pull but gets it high on the bat and it goes to long-off"
18.2,"Russell to Parag, 1 run","yorker on the fifth stump line, steered to deep point"
18.1,"Russell to Archer, 1 run","too short and he pulls it well, but there is a deep midwicket"
17.6,"Prasidh to Parag, SIX runs","smoked goes for the aggressive option of bowling a bouncer, but Riyan - with a cool belying his years - just rocks back and pulls it high and handsome, way over deep square leg"
17.5,"Prasidh to Parag, no run","excellent comeback by Prasidh, wide yorker, out of the batsman's reach and within the tram-lines. Riyan was moreover giving himself room so he had to really stretch out to try and get bat on that."
17.4,"Prasidh to Parag, FOUR runs","inside edge goes for four He was moving across and wanted to smash this to cow corner but gets an inside edge. Luck is on his side, it goes very fine for a boundary"
17.3,"Prasidh to Archer, 1 run","nicely timed but there is a man on the cover boundary. Full toss outside off, punched"
17.2,"Prasidh to Parag, 1 run","has a big thrash at that towards long-on but doesn't time it, and it rolls along the ground to the fielder there"
17.1,"Prasidh to Archer, 1 run",blasted this full delivery from the stumps but straight to Narine at mid-off. He was moving to his left and the ball hits his boot
16.6,"Narine to Archer, 1 run","back of a length, and Archer swipes it to deep midwicket off the back foot"
16.5,"Narine to Parag, 1 run","good length outside off, he gets down low and cuts it to the sweeper on the cover fence"
16.4,"Narine to Parag, FOUR runs",quicker one but strays on the pads and Riyan does superbly to just tickle it fine
16.3,"Narine to Parag, 2 runs",comes forward and clips it between long and on deep midwicket
16.2,"Narine to Archer, 1 run","leading edge that falls in no-man's land at cover. He was moving across to flick it to leg, but didn't read the spin"
16.1,"Narine to Archer, SIX runs",swatted down the ground given room to free his arms outside off and he smashes it with a horizontal bat straight back
19.6,"Unadkat to Karthik, 1 run","doesn't connect with the pull, and midwicket collects it on the bounce. So Karthik finishes on 97, but he's played a magnificent hand. This was a length ball - Unadkat finally abandoned trying for the yorker - and a slower one on leg stump"
19.5,"Unadkat to Karthik, SIX runs","demolished. Unadkat misses the yorker again, too full and Karthik powers this straight back past the bowler and over the sightscreen"
19.4,"Unadkat to Karthik, no run","good length on the pads, and he's flicked it to deep square but declines the single."
19.3,"Unadkat to Karthik, SIX runs",smashed. Karthik's gone to his highest IPL score at 90. He's batting very deep in his crease and Unadkat is not getting his yorkers right. DK stays back and power-drives it over long-on with a lot of bottom hand
19.2,"Unadkat to Karthik, FOUR runs","shot. Stayed deep in his crease and picked up this full length ball from the stumps, to power it to the midwicket boundary. Unadkat was looking for the yorker, but didn't get it"
19.1,"Unadkat to Singh, 1 run","back of a length outside off, mis-times the pull to long-on"
18.6,"Archer to Karthik, SIX runs","slower ball, length on the stumps and DK moves across to pull it over the fielder at deep square. Excellent timing again."
18.5,"Archer to Karthik, SIX runs",that is some swat Short ball outside off and he stands tall to slap it over extra cover. Such great timing that it carries all the way
18.4,"Archer to Singh, 1 run","giving himself room to try and carve it into the offside, but Archer follows him with a pacy 146kph yorker length ball and he can only send it as far as the in-field"
18.3,"Archer to Karthik, 1 run","good length outside off, slashed away but Binny does well at backward point to go to his left and stop the ball"

17.5,"Unadkat to Karthik, FOUR runs","Rahane with another fine effort but can't prevent the boundary stand and deliver shot by karthik, too short on the stumps and he swats it away. Rahane runs across and dives full length at square leg. Gets a hand to it but it doesn't stick on. What's worse, he appears to have hurt his shoulder. He's going off the field, rubbing and rotating his left shoulder"
17.5,"Unadkat to Karthik, 1 wide",loses control of that slower one and pushes it well wide of off stump. Outside the tramlines and wide
17.4,"Unadkat to Karthik, no run","moved across  a long way looking for the paddle scoop but good bowling by Unadkat who fires it in quick and full at the batsman and Karthik can't connect. Rinku was rushing down from the other end but is sent back. The throw is a bit awry from the keeper, which allows him to scramble back"
17.3,"Unadkat to Karthik, FOUR runs","excellent placement from Karthik, this was a length ball going across and Karthik stayed still and beside it, cutting it past backward point"
17.2,"Unadkat to Brathwaite, OUT","Rahane with a fine catch at deep midwicket the former Royals captain shows his team-mates how it's done. Length ball on the stumps, Brathwaite is targetting cow corner and over, but ends up getting a toe-end. Rahane runs to his right and tumbles forward to hold on to the catch"
17.1,"Unadkat to Brathwaite, FOUR runs","shovelled down to fine leg. Good length on leg stump, and Brathwaite was setting himself up for a big heave over midwicket, but uses his wrists to adjust at the last moment and get it past short fine leg"
16.6,"Thomas to Karthik, SIX runs","and he makes the free hit count, sending it just over a leaping Ben Stokes at long-on. Length ball and Karthik went back in his crease to create the room to swat it away"
16.6,"Thomas to Brathwaite, (no ball) 1 run","over-stepped. That was a good ball, yorker on off and Brathwaite, got behind it to push it past the bowler, which means Karthik will face the Free Hit"
16.5,"Thomas to Russell, OUT","he's caught now Was dropped twice but not third-time lucky. Short ball on the stumps, he clears his front leg to pull. Like he has all through this innings, there's no timing at all on that, and perhaps the hurt wrist reduces power too. Ends up going off the toe-end to deep midwicket that Riyan Parag takes comfortably."
16.4,"Thomas to Karthik, 1 run","good length on the pads, flicked to deep square"
16.3,"Thomas to Russell, 1 run","straight up in the air and dropped for a second time Prashant Chopra, the substitute fielder was under it at point, doesn't get under it and ends up diving to his left and can't hold on. This was a length ball and Russell got a top edge off an intended pull, went swirling in the air. Plenty of time to catch it, or perhaps too much time, which resulted in the drop"
16.2,"Thomas to Karthik, 1 run","good length outside off, steered to third man and that's fifty for Karthik"
16.1,"Thomas to Russell, 1 run","Short ball and Russell pulls again but without timing, deep midwicket collects"
15.6,"Unadkat to Russell, 1 run","the slower bouncer to Russell seems to be working. Another one angled across, and he has to wait for it, and can only do a tennis ball swat almost to deep midwicket"
15.5,"Unadkat to Karthik, 1 run","good length on off, pushed to point for a quick run. Steve Smith fires in a throw but misses the stumps. Russell might have been in trouble if he had hit"
15.4,"Unadkat to Karthik, SIX runs","shot that is some peachy timing. DK has found his groove in this innings. Back of a length on the pads, he moves across and effortlessly flicks, carries all the way over deep square leg"
15.3,"Unadkat to Russell, 1 run","another slower back of length ball, only 115 kph. Russell goes deep and across and pulls it to long-on. Didn't time it perfectly"
15.2,"Unadkat to Russell, no run","intelligently bowled. slower bouncer going across him and Russell is too early into the pull, swings and misses"
15.1,"Unadkat to Russell, SIX runs","bang first ball after being dropped, he gets a full one on the toes, clears his front leg and slams it over deep midwicket"
14.6,"Archer to Russell, 1 run",Binny has dropped Russell at deep point It's not been a good day for him. This was short and wide outside off and Russell had a good old thrash at it. Binny was in place for such a shot but ends up clanging it. How costly will that be?
14.5,"Archer to Russell, no run",gave himself room and wanted to whack it over midwicket but gets a thick under-edge that Samson dives to his left to collect one-bounce
14.4,"Archer to Karthik, 1 run","good length coming in from outside off, glided to third man"
14.4,"Archer to Karthik, 1 wide","fast and short, but wide down legside and he'll have to rebowl that"

14.2,"Archer to Russell, 1 run","slower ball, good length outside off, chopped to third man. Think Russell had read it late, adjusted to play the shot"
14.1,"Archer to Russell, no run","yorker  at 148 kph on middle and Russell goes deep in his crease, gets behind and offers a full bat face"
13.6,"Aaron to Karthik, FOUR runs","too short and too wide outside off, too much room and Karthik won't miss out on that. Cuts it to the point fence with power and precision. Did that hamstring hurting play a part in Aaron bowling a poor ball?"
13.5,"Aaron to Karthik, no run","short on the stumps, and Karthik wants to pull forcefully off the back foot but gets it off the bottom half of the bat and it trickles to midwicket"
13.4,"Aaron to Karthik, no run","good length on the stumps, patted back"
13.3,"Aaron to Karthik, no run","great stop by Samson behind the stumps. Wide yorker, just inside the tram-line, another knuckle ball perhaps. Karthik throws his bat at it and gets an under edge that is travelling to Samson's right, but he dives and stops it. Would have been four otherwise"
13.2,"Aaron to Karthik, SIX runs","slashed for six Aaron can do something wrong today too after all. Short ball outside off, but enough room for Karthik to cut it uppishly and all the way over point"
13.1,"Aaron to Karthik, no run","full outside off, driven to cover"
12.6,"Thomas to Karthik, 1 run","length ball on the stumps, clipped towards mid-on"
12.5,"Thomas to Russell, 1 run",pacy short ball at 143.4 kph outside off. Russell gets behind it and guides it to third man

12.3,"Thomas to Karthik, 1 leg bye","back of a length on leg, whipped off his hips to short fine leg"

12.1,"Thomas to Karthik, 1 run","short of length outside off, Karthik gets on his toes to steer it to third man"
11.6,"Archer to Karthik, 1 run","back of a length on off, and he pulls it to midwicket, but he's slipped and fallen while hitting the shot. Luckily for him, doesn't hit the stumps, picks himself up and they take a single"
11.5,"Archer to Karthik, no run","back of a length outside off, defended and it rolls to the keeper"
11.4,"Archer to Karthik, no run","good length outside off, defended to point"
11.3,"Archer to Karthik, OUT","that's poor running from Narine. good length coming in from outside off, Karthik has tucked this to deep square leg and it seemed like there was a two there, but Narine was very slow on his feet and he's well out of the crease at the non-striker's end when Aaron's throw comes in and Archer whips the bails off. What's more they ran one run short too, so quite a pointless wicket all around"
11.2,"Archer to Karthik, no run","full outside off, driven crisply, but straight to mid-off"
11.1,"Archer to Karthik, SIX runs","flicked off his hips for six that is some exceptional timing. Back of a length on the hips and Karthik didn't seem to hit it with power, but timed it so well it flew off over deep square leg"
10.6,"Gopal to Narine, SIX runs","Narine gets into the act now. Shreyas is under pressure and he bowls one too full, perfectly in Narine's arc, and he slog-sweeps powerfully to send it soaring over the boundary. Huge over for KKR"
10.5,"Gopal to Karthik, 1 run","good length on off, he comes on the front foot to steer it to backward point"
10.4,"Gopal to Karthik, FOUR runs",smoked through extra cover now! Karthik has exploded in this over. Full toss outside off and he drives it powerfully
10.3,"Gopal to Karthik, FOUR runs","misfield by Stuart Binny at deep midwicket this was sloppy. Karthik had worked this fuller one with his wrists and the ball wasn't travelling all that fast, but somehow Binny fumbles it and allows it to go through his legs for a boundary"
10.2,"Gopal to Karthik, FOUR runs","outside edge goes for four. Nice comeback by the bowler, but good adjustment by Karthik too. Flighted outside off and he was coming forward to  it, realises he's not to the pitch, and almost deliberately opens the face to run it down"
10.1,"Gopal to Karthik, SIX runs","massive Karthik breaks the shackles, and that's a free gift of a ball too. Half-tracker that gave him plenty of time to rock back and smash it over square leg"
9.6,"Unadkat to Narine, no run",
9.5,"Unadkat to Narine, no run","slower short one on middle, Narine fends it with his eyes off the ball, it misses everything, hits him flush on the helmet and balloons up in the air, but short of point"

3.6,"Thomas to Rana, 1 leg bye","length on the pads, hurried for pace and misses the flick but the deflection off the pad down to fine-leg helps Rana retain strike"

19.5,"Yadav to Ashwin, 1 run","dropped by Kohli! Well, the game's safe so it won't be a costly mistake, but these never look good. The ball was slogged almost straight to him, but it just pops out of his reverse-cupped hands. De Villiers, close to him at long off, has a chuckle"
19.4,"Yadav to Ashwin, no run","no hat trick for Yadav, but Ashwin is nonetheless beaten by a full one that zips past his flailing bat outside off"
19.3,"Yadav to Viljoen, OUT","gloved down the leg side, and this game is safe now. Umesh greets his fellow quick Hardus with a bumper first up, and he can only get a glove on it. Parthiv makes ground and tumbles to his left to hold the low, dipping chance, and Yadav is on a hat trick as the Chinnaswamy finds its voice once more"
19.2,"Yadav to Ashwin, OUT","but maybe it is now. The ball was a similar one, so the shot was on again, but Ashwin just didn't get the connection he was looking for. He still got enough on it to make the catch a difficult one - Kohli had to time his leap, right next to the boundary at long on, just right, but he does so and holds the catch cleanly"
19.1,"Yadav to Ashwin, SIX runs","but Ashwin still believes! Yadav offers up a length delivery on the stumps, and the skipper just slams it straight down the ground. This ain't over yet"
18.6,"Saini to Pooran, OUT","another skied slog, but this one is held! If anything, this one went even further up in the air than the last chance as Pooran backed away and heaved at a full one. The ball is in the air for an age, coming down with ice on it, but if there's one fielder you'd trust to hold such a difficult chance, it's de Villiers. He settles under the swirling chance, and has to dive at the last minute to get to it, but clings on"

18.4,"Saini to Pooran, 1 run","Pooran sets himself to smash this short one over square leg, but the ball goes completely in the opposite direction, bouncing out to deep point for a single. Pooran's in no danger of under-hitting one"

18.2,"Saini to Mandeep, no run","and he attempts a cheeky paddle-scoop first ball, but Saini rushes a full ball right between his legs for a vital dot ball"
18.1,"Saini to Miller, OUT","caught at long on! Well, Stoinis has just dropped Pooran, but de Villiers makes no mistake in the deep to get rid of Miller. The ball was full, and the shot was on, but Miller just didn't get the height or the distance he was looking for. AB made ground, running around in front of the sightscreen and then diving forward to hold the chance"
17.6,"Yadav to Pooran, no run","Pooran is going to hurt his back if he keeps swinging this hard at the ball! I'm not sure where he was looking to hit this, but if he had managed to put bat on ball, it would have travelled. As it happens, he's beaten outside off"
17.5,"Yadav to Miller, 1 run",quick single! Miller taps to cover and they just set off. A direct hit would have been interesting
17.5,"Yadav to Miller, 1 wide",
17.4,"Yadav to Pooran, 1 run","dropped by Stoinis! Pooran backed away and top edged a wild pull high into the night sky. Stoinis seemed to keep his eyes on it all the way, getting under the chance, but he kept his hands low trying to catch it and it just popped straight out. No reverse cup either from the Australian. Could that be the game? Could that be the end of RCB's campaign?"
17.3,"Yadav to Miller, 1 run",Miller whips a full one into the leg side with plenty of bottom hand
17.2,"Yadav to Pooran, 1 run","Pooran has almost swung himself off his feet trying to hit this, but it comes on to him just a bit too quickly and he toe-ends it down to long off"
17.1,"Yadav to Miller, 1 run","Miller does exactly as he needs to, dropping the ball close in on the leg side for a quick single"
16.6,"Southee to Miller, 1 run","slugged down to long on, and Miller keeps the strike"
16.5,"Southee to Miller, no run","slower one, on a length outside off, and Miller is beaten"
16.4,"Southee to Pooran, 1 run","struck on the grille! Southee digs it in short and beats Pooran's pull, the ball striking him flush on the grille. But he maintains his composure and completes the run"
16.3,"Southee to Miller, 1 run","slower ball from Southee, down to 115km/h, and Miller hands the strike back over to Pooran with a nudge to point"
16.2,"Southee to Miller, FOUR runs","into the leg side now, Miller stepping back to hammer a length delivery from Southee to deep midwicket. And his strike rate goes above a run a ball for the first time"
16.1,"Southee to Miller, FOUR runs","slashed to third man! The fielder is up inside the circle in that position, so Miller just needed to get it past him. He flashes at a back of a length delivery from Southee, and places it just right"
15.6,"Ali to Pooran, no run","Moeen sends this one down wider of off stump, and the ball grips in the surface to beat the edge of Pooran's slashing square drive"
15.5,"Ali to Pooran, SIX runs",but not for long! Moeen offers up a full toss and Pooran mooses it mightily over long on
15.4,"Ali to Pooran, no run","nice comeback from Moeen, holding his one back and pushing his line a little further outside off to keep the batsman quiet"
15.3,"Ali to Pooran, SIX runs","a fourth six over long off! Pooran knows where his strength lies. He backs away to put a straight delivery right in his arc, slamming it way over long off"
15.2,"Ali to Miller, 1 run",Miller is half forward to drive to long off
15.1,"Ali to Miller, no run","looped down on middle and leg, and Miller misses his sweep"
14.6,"Saini to Miller, 1 run","Saini nudges the speedometer up towards 143km/h, Miller glancing out to deep midwicket"
14.5,"Saini to Miller, no run","speared in to the pads, and Miller can't get bat on his attempted glance"
14.4,"Saini to Miller, 2 runs","a diving Chahal saves runs! He had some work to do after Miller timed a slash very well behind square, making ground from third man and then diving to save two"
14.3,"Saini to Pooran, 1 run","Saini's response - typical of a fast bowler - is to dig in a bouncer at better than 140km/h. It's a little too hot for Pooran, who mistimes a pull to long on"
14.2,"Saini to Pooran, FOUR runs","flat! Pooran clears his left leg and smears a length delivery over extra cover. The ball never got over a few metres in height, but it crashes into the boundary marker on the full   or just in front of it perhaps, as it's given as a four"
14.1,"Saini to Pooran, no run","probing start, Saini landing a virtual yorker just outside off and Pooran digging it out to point"
13.6,"Sundar to Pooran, 1 run","faster, flatter, and it's just a single out to the sweeper"
13.5,"Sundar to Pooran, no run","beaten on the slog! Brave stuff from Sundar, tossing this one up high. Pooran's head fell back and he lost his shape awkwardly, the ball dipping past his wild heave"
13.4,"Sundar to Pooran, SIX runs","third one in the over! And it's in exactly the same spot. Pooran shimmies and makes room, slamming a 90-metre six into the stands beyond long off"
13.3,"Sundar to Pooran, no run","Pooran makes room, but Sundar pulls his length back and follows him to stop the shot"
13.2,"Sundar to Pooran, SIX runs","and again! Pooran backs himself to blast another one clear of the long off fielder, and though he doesn't quite get all of this one, it goes the distance"
13.1,"Sundar to Pooran, SIX runs","Pooran breaks the shackles! Something had to give, with the required rate ballooning. He makes room and sends the ball arcing deep into the crowd beyond long off"
12.6,"Ali to Pooran, 1 run","slapped uppishly down to long off, the ball falling well in front of the fielder"
12.5,"Ali to Miller, 1 run","eased down to long on, just the one"
12.4,"Ali to Pooran, 1 run","Moeen spots Pooran backing away to leg and follows him, the ball coming off the inside half of a wild swat into the leg side and rolling out to deep square leg"
12.3,"Ali to Miller, 1 run","Miller gives long off more work to do, punching off the back foot"
12.2,"Ali to Pooran, 1 run",Pooran backs away and hacks a drive out to long off
12.1,"Ali to Miller, 1 run","Miller looks to be proactive, jumping out at Moeen, but he can't get under it and it's only a single to long on"
11.6,"Sundar to Pooran, no run","almost a caught-and-bowled! Pooran backed away, opening up his stance, but he's too early into his push as the ball grips the surface and nearly punts it back to the bowler, who dives forward but can't get the fingers underneath it"
11.5,"Sundar to Miller, 1 run","worked with the angle into the leg side, turning the strike over"
11.4,"Sundar to Miller, no run","Sundar gives him nothing, zoning in on Miller's pads"
11.3,"Sundar to Pooran, 1 run","speared in at his pads again, and this time Pooran finds space with a flick into the leg side"
11.2,"Sundar to Pooran, no run","another slider from around the stumps, and Pooran can't lay bat on an expansive attempted pull"
11.1,"Sundar to Pooran, no run","Sundar, finally, is into his work for the evening, sliding one in to Pooran to start"
10.6,"Ali to Pooran, 1 run","fired in flat on off stump, Pooran backing away and chopping to long off to keep the strike"
10.5,"Ali to Miller, 1 run","down to long off this time, just the one"
10.4,"Ali to Miller, no run","Miller drives, but again he can't find a gap at cover"
10.3,"Ali to Miller, no run","a diving Kohli saves runs, Miller leaning into a drive that can't beat the RCB skipper in the covers"
10.2,"Ali to Pooran, 1 run",Pooran's off the mark straight away with a drive to long off
10.1,"Ali to Rahul, OUT","and he strikes first ball! This will dent Kings XI's chances even further. Rahul was looking to get after Moeen straight away, but his lofted stroke comes off the end of the bat and finds Southee at long off. It's not the biggest boundary, but the shot doesn't have the legs to beat him"
9.6,"Stoinis to Rahul, 1 run","tip-and-run single for Rahul, chopping it down close in on the off side"
9.5,"Stoinis to Miller, 1 run","tapped down in front of point, who can't quite stop the single"
9.4,"Stoinis to Rahul, 1 run","direct hit might have had him! Rahul nudged almost straight to Chahal at midwicket and just set off. He's only got one stump to aim at, and misses"
9.3,"Stoinis to Miller, 1 run",Miller opens his account with a drive to long on
9.2,"Stoinis to Miller, no run","and he steps into a defensive push to point to start, finding the fielder perfectly"
9.1,"Stoinis to Agarwal, OUT","Stoinis breaks through! Against the run of play. And it was a fairly innocuous delivery, just short of a length and straight. Mayank was looking to pull it off the front foot, and didn't bother keeping it down, but the ball has just rushed on quicker than he expected, looping off the splice to be caught by a tumbling Chahal at midwicket inside the circle. Stoinis bellows his approval at the wicket. Kohli's pretty chuffed too"
8.6,"Chahal to Agarwal, 1 run",and a nudged single means he keeps the strike
8.5,"Chahal to Agarwal, FOUR runs","too short, Mayank crouching at the crease to get into position for a front-foot pull, and nailing the shot well in front of square"
8.4,"Chahal to Agarwal, 2 runs","glanced behind square, and they hurry back for the second"
8.3,"Chahal to Agarwal, SIX runs","flat and hard! The ball was full, just outside off, and Mayank decided to take on the fielder at long off. He gets just enough on it to beat the leaping fielder, and raises the fifty stand"
8.2,"Chahal to Rahul, 1 run","nurdled straight of midwicket, and there's room for a quick single"
8.1,"Chahal to Agarwal, 1 run",Mayank whips across his front pad to collect a single behind square on the leg side
7.6,"Stoinis to Rahul, 2 runs","poor line from Stoinis, offering up a very friendly length delivery down the leg side. But some nifty tag-team fielding at the boundary's edge saves runs"
7.5,"Stoinis to Agarwal, 1 run","wicket-to-wicket stuff, and it's flicked out to the man in the deep on the leg side"
7.4,"Stoinis to Agarwal, FOUR runs","short from Stoinis, but he just doesn't have the pace to trouble the bat. Mayank swivels to pull a 130km/h bumper out to deep backward square"
7.3,"Stoinis to Agarwal, no run","Mayank unfurls a handsome leg glance, but it's directed straight at Chahal, at midwicket inside the circle"
7.2,"Stoinis to Rahul, 1 run","Rahul backs away, but is content with a firm push down to long on to turn the strike over"
7.1,"Stoinis to Agarwal, 1 run","his first ball seams in off a length, Mayank flicking it into the leg side. He wanted more, but couldn't execute"
6.6,"Saini to Rahul, no run",Saini keeps the speedometer nudging 140 clicks as he ends his over with another delivery that zones in on off stump and is pushed to cover
6.5,"Saini to Rahul, no run","chopped down to point, and Rahul wants a single but he's sent back. And rightfully so, as Stoinis swoops and has a shy"
6.4,"Saini to Rahul, FOUR runs","edged to third man! Saini finds the channel outside off, and Rahul just hangs his bat out at it. There's no slip in place, so it's relatively safe to go fishing. And he's got four for it"
6.3,"Saini to Agarwal, 1 run","Mayank slashes, but he doesn't get all of this and the ball bounces down to third man, just the single"
6.2,"Saini to Agarwal, FOUR runs","but the riposte from the batsman is immediate, stepping into a smoking drive, on the up, through cover point. It was the width that invited the shot"
6.1,"Saini to Agarwal, no run","is this the edge? Saini's excited, but the umpire shakes his head. There's no doubt about the quality of the delivery though, bursting off a length outside off at better than 140km/h, and beating Mayank's outside edge"
5.6,"Chahal to Agarwal, 1 run","dabbed down to short third man, and they scoot through for a single"
5.5,"Chahal to Rahul, 1 run","punched a little awkwardly to cover, but there's room for a single"
5.4,"Chahal to Rahul, no run","under edge on this? Yes, must have been, as he misses a sweep but manages to keep the ball away from his stumps"
5.3,"Chahal to Rahul, FOUR runs","Chahal over-corrects after the last delivery, dropping it short and wide outside off to open up the cover field for Rahul's scything cut"
5.2,"Chahal to Rahul, SIX runs","nothing rushed about this shot, Rahul stepping out to lift a full ball cleanly over wide long on. He was playing against the turn, but kept his balance and pinged it out of the middle"
5.1,"Chahal to Rahul, no run","good start, hurrying Rahul's defence with one that rushes on to him"
4.6,"Southee to Agarwal, no run","good finish to the over, keeping things tight in the channel as Mayank chops to mid off"
4.5,"Southee to Agarwal, no run","he spots a little width outside off and throws himself into a big shot, but ball beats bat"
4.4,"Southee to Agarwal, no run","straighter from Southee, and Mayank can't do anything with the splice-jarring length"
4.3,"Southee to Agarwal, FOUR runs",
4.2,"Southee to Agarwal, FOUR runs","this time Mayank goes the other way, stepping across to the off side to play a neat little pick-up to a scramble-seam delivery from Southee, raising the fifty. That's Kings XI's fastest fifty of the season so far"
4.1,"Southee to Agarwal, no run","Mayank stays leg side of the ball, but Southee follows him and cramps him for room"
3.6,"Yadav to Rahul, no run",punches the back of a length ball outside off to cover
3.5,"Yadav to Rahul, FOUR runs","whips it away over midwicket with disdain practically dripping out of him. He's clearly asking, ""really, a leg-stump half-volley? To me? REALLY?"""
3.4,"Yadav to Rahul, no run","looks to chop and run to point byt Klaasen's there and though he's a keeper, he's pretty quick off the blocks. Wonder who he's subbing for "
3.4,"Yadav to Rahul, 1 wide","goes full, and a touch too straight, Rahul misses the flick"
3.3,"Yadav to Agarwal, 1 run",works the back of a length ball towards mid-on
3.2,"Yadav to Gayle, OUT","taken at long-on now and de Villiers holds the pose, standing in front of his beloved RCB fans! Seriously, there's only like three inches between his boots and the boundary and he takes it so florgin coolly! Holds the ball and his hands aloft for a second or two for the photographers and then runs into the huddle. Lovely stuff from the RCB's greatest game-changer. And the ex-RCB game-changer leaves having mis-hit a short ball, the pull shot going up instead of long"
3.1,"Yadav to Gayle, SIX runs",dumps a horrible full toss over long-on. That's about the most merciful treatment anyone can dole out to a ball like that.
2.6,"Saini to Rahul, no run","fullish on middle, Rahul is content to defend it"
2.5,"Saini to Rahul, FOUR runs","over the top! He gets a delicious half-volley as reward for the last shot and tucks in with a loft over cover. Oh, this man is going to spoil batting fans for years to come."
2.4,"Saini to Rahul, FOUR runs",classical as carnatic music! Leans forward to an innocuous delivery outside the off stump and unceremoniously - but also beautifully - drives it through the covers
2.3,"Saini to Gayle, 1 run",works it off his hips through square leg. There's a man patrolling that boundary
2.2,"Saini to Gayle, no run",good bowling! Saini doesn't get sucked in by his own ego and goes for the slower ball - he does dig it into the wicket though - and Gayle is comfortably beaten on the pull shot
2.1,"Saini to Gayle, FOUR runs",bang! The boss is in! And he shows the young tyke what's what by clearing the front leg and drumming a short ball to the straight boundary. O-u-c-h!
1.6,"Yadav to Rahul, no run","tries to beat point to his left, but the substitute Klaasen isn't so easily beaten and Umesh gets a way with a short and wide one"
1.5,"Yadav to Rahul, no run",looks for the glamour shot over extra cover - and he does play it well - but Umesh's length ball gets just enough nip away off the deck to beat Rahul's blade
1.4,"Yadav to Rahul, no run",nudges the shortish delivery on middle to midwicket
1.3,"Yadav to Rahul, no run","good length, outside off, defends"
1.2,"Yadav to Rahul, FOUR runs","length, angling down the leg side, with a little ribbon tied around it. Rahul accepts the glorious gift with a flick to the long leg boundary again"
1.1,"Yadav to Rahul, FOUR runs",that's awesome! He doesn't really have the length or the line to pull the ball - it's actually cramping him and the ball doesn't really rise as much as he'd like - but Rahul holds his shape beautifully and just helps it away to the long leg boundary with a little short-arm pull
1.1,"Yadav to Rahul, 1 wide",back of a length and sliding down the leg side. Rahul leaves and the extras tick over
0.6,"Southee to Gayle, FOUR runs","opens the face and carves the full and wide delivery over point. Great start from Gayle. Jeez, don't you usually block the first over out?"
0.5,"Southee to Gayle, FOUR runs","he's squared up by the ball angling across him, short of a length, but he adjusts just about well enough to slice the ball past the left of short third man"
0.4,"Southee to Gayle, no run",that's better. Hits the deck. Cramps him up with his line. Gayle still tries to launch it down the ground but he comes up with nothing
0.3,"Southee to Gayle, FOUR runs","crashes it over point! And languidly at that! It's the equivalent of him waking up and yawning at the sun. Seriously. A length ball allowing him to free the arms? Bad move, Southee"
0.3,"Southee to Gayle, 1 wide",plays keep-away with the ball but it slides a little too far outside the off stump for him to win
0.2,"Southee to Gayle, no run","yorker first up to Gayle, who brings the bat down in time and turns it away from middle stump and into midwicket"
0.1,"Southee to Rahul, 1 run","a gentle little nudge off his pads into the midwicket region. Southee searches for some swing, angling it in and getting the ball to straighten just enough"
19.6,"Viljoen to Stoinis, SIX runs",and a six to finish the innings! The stadium erupts as Stoinis laces a length delivery up and over the leg side to raise the 200
19.5,"Viljoen to Stoinis, FOUR runs","the runs keep flowing, Hardus gifting Stoinis a full toss on leg stump. He gets a touch on it, and the pace takes it to the boundary"
19.4,"Viljoen to Stoinis, SIX runs","Stoinis joins the party! It's a cutter from Viljoen, but it lands in the slot and Stoinis hammers it over long on"
19.3,"Viljoen to Stoinis, FOUR runs","paddled to deep backward square, Stoinis getting a healthy piece of bat on a full toss from Hardus that was anyway headed down the leg side"
19.2,"Viljoen to AB, 1 run","flapped into the leg side, just the one"
19.1,"Viljoen to AB, SIX runs","another one! De Villiers brings up the 100 stand with his seventh six, Hardus feeding him a full straight one and AB hammering it over wide long on"
18.6,"Shami to AB, 1 leg bye","another massive swipe, but this time the ball beats the bat and pings off his thigh into the off side"
18.5,"Shami to AB, SIX runs","three in a row! This has flown clean out of the park, but it was nothing more than a wild fend from AB as Shami let slip with a high full toss. AB was actually turning his head away to take evasive action as the ball got to him, but somehow the ball finds the middle of the bat and exits the stadium. AB reckons that might have been above waist height, but the umpire disagrees"
18.4,"Shami to AB, SIX runs","and again! Same ball, same shot, same result. If anything, he hit this one even better. It didn't go as high, but travelled further"
18.3,"Shami to AB, SIX runs","sliced over long off! How has this gone so far? It looked like de Villiers had sliced under this one, but it just kept going and going and going"
18.2,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 bye","well bowled by Shami, who changes it up with a slower bouncer that Stoinis can't lay bat on. Again they pinch a bye"
18.1,"Shami to AB, 1 bye","just short of a length, outside off, and AB misses his slash but they pinch a bye"
17.6,"Viljoen to Stoinis, 2 runs","full, wide and Stoinis squeezes it out behind point, hurrying back for a second"
17.5,"Viljoen to Stoinis, no run","Stoinis looks to go big on the leg side, but he hits only fresh air"
17.4,"Viljoen to AB, 1 run","that's much better, Hardus finding his radar with a yorker on middle and off that's dug out to long on"
17.4,"Viljoen to AB, 1 wide","oh dear, that's slipped out way too wide and he'll have to try again"
17.4,"Viljoen to AB, 1 wide","flung much too far outside off, and he'll have to bowl it again"
17.3,"Viljoen to AB, SIX runs","that forecast might keep going up! De Villiers has absolutely monstered this straight back over the bowler's head. It was a long half volley, but he leathered it with awesome power. And they'll need another ball brought out. For real this time"
17.2,"Viljoen to AB, FOUR runs","yorker goes awry, Hardus losing his line and sending the ball down the leg side. AB just needs to get bat on ball, and he does so to bring up his fifty"
17.1,"Viljoen to Stoinis, 1 run","Stoinis swings across the line, but he can't get under it and it's just the one to long on"
16.6,"Ashwin to AB, no run","de Villiers turns himself around into a reverse-slog-sweep, but the ball fizzes past him as he misses the shot"
16.5,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run","flapped down to long on, just the one"
16.4,"Ashwin to Stoinis, no run","well bowled, floated up but dipping into the blockhole to keep Stoinis quiet"
16.3,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 2 runs","this looked like another carrom ball, but Stoinis spots it and times his slashed cut out to the cover sweeper"
16.2,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","AB sets himself and slashes from the crease, looking to slice the ball to the left of the cover sweeper, but he can't get it past him"
16.1,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run",flicked with the spin into the leg side to turn the strike over
15.6,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run","punched to cover, and they chance a quick single"
15.5,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","nice come-back from the bowler, getting the ball right up to him. De Villiers can't get anything under the ball, instead driving to long off"
15.4,"Ashwin to AB, SIX runs",into the terraces! De Villiers rocks back to slam a long-hop powerfully over wide midwicket. And that also brings up the fifty partnership
15.3,"Ashwin to AB, 2 runs","nicely flicked by de Villiers, behind square on the leg side, and Gayle is the fielder at short fine so they're easily back for a second"
15.2,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run","pushed down to long on, just the one - but importantly he hands the strike over"
15.1,"Ashwin to Stoinis, no run","legbreak, and Stoinis pokes defensively at it from the crease"
14.6,"Rajpoot to AB, no run","nicely bowled. He's under pressure, but he's responded well to bring this over back, ending it with a pinpoint yorker that de Villiers can do nothing with"
14.5,"Rajpoot to Stoinis, 1 run","another slow cutter, this one at around 109km/h, and there's a big cheer from the crowd as Gayle fields a gentle push off the pads at square leg"
14.4,"Rajpoot to AB, 1 run","slower ball at just under 116km/h, and the only damage is a single out to the sweeper"
14.3,"Rajpoot to AB, SIX runs","they might need another ball now! Rajpoot persists with the back-of-a-length stuff, and de Villiers rocks back into a fiery pull, sending the ball way into the stands beyond midwicket"
14.2,"Rajpoot to AB, FOUR runs","flayed in front of square! This wasn't all that short, but de Villiers is camped on the back foot and waiting for it to collect his second boundary"
14.1,"Rajpoot to Stoinis, 1 run",
13.6,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run","flatter, straighter, and Stoinis finds a quick single to short fine leg"
13.5,"Ashwin to Stoinis, SIX runs","this will help! Very full from Ashwin, too full in fact, and Stoinis' eyes light up. He sends the long half volley arcing back over the bowler's head, and into the first tier of the stands"
13.4,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","very full, just outside off, and it's thumped through cover with plenty of bottom hand"
13.3,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run","nudged into a gap on the off side, and there's space for a quick single"
13.2,"Ashwin to Stoinis, no run","chopped hard into the covers, where a diving stop saves runs"
13.1,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","was this an edge? Yes! This is a delightful delivery from Ashwin, gripping and spinning across de Villiers, who pokes at it and sends an edge flying past the keeper. Slip would have gobbled it up, and that's the hundred"
12.6,"Viljoen to Stoinis, 2 runs","nicely placed by Stoinis, into the acres of space on the leg side with midwicket on the fence. In fact, there's even time enough for them to rush back for a second"
12.5,"Viljoen to Stoinis, no run","Viljoen keeps things tight on off stump, Stoinis coming half forward to defend"
12.4,"Viljoen to AB, 1 run","dug in short, but misdirected down the leg side. The punishment isn't too severe though, de Villiers pulling to the fielder at deep backward square"
12.3,"Viljoen to Stoinis, 1 leg bye","Stoinis misses a glance at a 142km/h delivery, but they find a single into the leg side off his pad"
12.2,"Viljoen to AB, 1 run","fuller, straighter, and it's flicked to Gayle at midwicket, eliciting a cheer from the crowd"
12.1,"Viljoen to AB, no run","another cutter, the speedo nudging towards 130km/h, and AB pokes at it from the crease"
11.6,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","offbreak at 95km/h, AB nudging with the spin and square of midwicket for one more"
11.5,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run","Stoinis works a flat dart from Ashwin into the leg side, long on keeping them to one"
11.4,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","chopped down through gully, and they pinch a single as short third man scoots around"
11.3,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run","Ashwin offers some width, Stoinis slashes a single to the sweeper"
11.2,"Ashwin to Stoinis, no run",a watchful push finds extra cover
11.1,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","AB plucks the ball off an off stump line, glancing into the leg side for a single"
10.6,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","AB finds a gap on the off side, and keeps the strike"
10.5,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run","legbreak, and it's nudged out to the cover sweeper"
10.4,"Ashwin to Stoinis, no run","Stoinis telegraphs his intentions to play a lap-sweep, but Ashwin adjusts to beat the stroke and hit him on the pad"
10.3,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","tucked straight of midwicket, just the one"
10.2,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run","Stoinis follows AB's lead, helping himself to a single to long off"
10.1,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","looped up on off stump, AB driving down to long off for a single"
9.6,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","chopped out to the sweeper once again, and AB keeps the strike"
9.5,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run","another push into the covers, but this one is placed well enough for a quick single"
9.4,"Ashwin to Stoinis, no run","Ashwin pulls his length back just a shade, Stoinis pressing to cover"
9.3,"Ashwin to Stoinis, no run","flicked off the toes, but straight to short midwicket"
9.2,"Ashwin to Stoinis, no run","full, straight, and Stoinis presents the full face of the bat to push the ball cautiously back at the bowler"
9.1,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","pushed out through the gap at cover point, just the one"
8.6,"Viljoen to Nath, OUT",tapped tamely to cover! Akshdeep was much too early into this push to cover as Viljoen rolled his fingers over a 134km/h cutter. The ball ballooned off the bat and presented Mandeep with the very simplest of chances
8.5,"Viljoen to Nath, no run","dug in short and outside off by Viljoen, Akshdeep failing to lay any bat on his attempted pull"
8.4,"Viljoen to AB, 1 run","AB lets his bottom hand do the work, digging an attempted yorker out just wide of mid off"
8.3,"Viljoen to Nath, 1 run","Akshdeep steps into a crunchy little drive, picking out the cover sweeper"
8.2,"Viljoen to AB, 1 run",AB waits and waits and chops down at the last moment to collect a single to third man
8.1,"Viljoen to Nath, 1 run",worked off a length and into the leg side
7.6,"Ashwin to Nath, 1 run","worked into the leg side, and into space for a single"
7.5,"Ashwin to Nath, no run",beaten on the outside edge! Akshdeep plays for turn and the ball scoots just past his outside edge
7.4,"Ashwin to Nath, no run","looped down with precious little flight, and tight on off stump to draw hurried defence from the new bat"
7.3,"Ashwin to Ali, OUT","bowled him! Moeen stayed deep in the crease, waiting and playing for orthodox turn, but the ball rushes on to him with the arm, skidding through a little low and slamming into the stumps. And that's that for Moeen and IPL 2019 - he's back to England now"
7.2,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","Ashwin offers up a hint of width, but there's protection at cover sweeper"
7.1,"Ashwin to AB, no run","quick, skidding on outside off, and AB tucks it back to the bowler"
6.6,"Ashwin to Ali, no run","chopped down to point, where the fielder is in place"
6.5,"Ashwin to Ali, no run","legbreak at 94km/h, and it's pressed defensively to cover"
6.4,"Ashwin to Ali, no run","googly this time, and it's not picked, zipping past the outside edge"
6.3,"Ashwin to Ali, FOUR runs","streaky start from Moeen, flashing outside off and sending an edge bouncing down to the third man boundary"
6.2,"Ashwin to Patel, OUT","vital breakthrough! Parthiv can barely drag himself from the crease. He plays across the line at a floaty googly, and a leading edge loops very tamely to his captain at cover. Parthiv looks suspiciously at the pitch as he trudges off, but this dismissal was down to good bowling and a loose stroke"
6.1,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run","legbreak, and it's slapped out to the cover sweeper to turn the strike over"
5.6,"Shami to Patel, no run","shorter, outside off, and it's dabbed down to gully"
5.5,"Shami to Patel, SIX runs","fetched over cow corner! Parthiv is going like a freight train. Shami aimed this one straighter, but the batsman was expecting it and clubbed confidently up and over the legside field. This is a cracker of a pitch"
5.4,"Shami to Patel, FOUR runs","width again! And it's a slower one, too. He spots it early, plants his right foot, and doesn't bother keeping it down as he scythes over cover"
5.3,"Shami to Patel, no run","smeared across the line, but he loses his shape over-hitting it and the ball goes nowhere"
5.2,"Shami to Patel, FOUR runs","sliced behind point this time! Shami lets slip with a full toss outside off, Parthiv slicing it deliberately fine to get it behind point - albeit aerially - for another boundary. He's inquisitive about a possible no-ball, but it's legitimate"
5.1,"Shami to Patel, FOUR runs","up and over mid off! Parthiv swings from a solid base at the crease, punting a full ball cleanly over mid off"
4.6,"Rajpoot to Patel, 1 run","and he concludes the over with a yorker, right up at his toes, that's dug out through backward point"
4.5,"Rajpoot to Patel, no run","Rajpoot puts a little more vim into this one, pulling his length back to beat Parthiv's edge as he has a little fiddle at a rising delivery outside off"
4.4,"Rajpoot to Patel, SIX runs","slammed down the ground! Parthiv's eyes light up as he picks a full slower ball out of the hand, clearing his front leg and cracking it 77 metres straight back over his head to bring up the fifty"
4.3,"Rajpoot to AB, 3 runs","misfield, and it brings runs! Two fielders converged on de Villiers' drive to cover, but neither could stop it. The ball is eventually hunted down near the rope"
4.2,"Rajpoot to AB, FOUR runs","pulled by de Villiers, though it's the line rather than the length that invited the shot. It really wasn't all that short, but the ball was drifting towards his legs and de Villiers threads the gap between midwicket and mid on with a firm pull"
4.1,"Rajpoot to AB, no run","on a length, just outside off, and de Villiers pushes on the up to cover"
3.6,"Shami to AB, 1 run","Shami continues to probe outside off, de Villiers poking at one that snakes in to him, an inside edge bouncing off his pads and into space for a run"
3.5,"Shami to Patel, 1 run","edged, but it's wide of slip and bounces harmlessly down to third man. Shami's found some wobble, and a testing length"
3.4,"Shami to AB, 1 run","short, and rising outside off at just over 140km/h. De Villiers is slightly rushed into a pull, but rolls his wrists on the shot to control it and collect a single"
3.3,"Shami to AB, no run","fuller, wider and de Villiers won't be tempted into anything injudicious outside off just yet"
3.2,"Shami to AB, no run","and he's almost done first ball! Shami tests AB on an offstump line with one that nips in to him, the ball coming off the inside half of the bat and bouncing just past the stumps"
3.1,"Shami to Kohli, OUT","and gets his man! A full house has been silenced as Kohli slices a drive uppishly into the covers, where this time the fielder - Mandeep - makes no mistake"
2.6,"Rajpoot to Patel, no run","nice change-up, a slower ball at 112km/h, and it has the beating of a Parthiv drive"
2.5,"Rajpoot to Patel, no run","and he switches back around the stumps for the left-hander, pitching it right up to him, Parthiv digging it out through gully"
2.4,"Rajpoot to Kohli, 1 run","Rajpoot pulls his length back a shade, Kohli hopping into a nurdle to leg"
2.3,"Rajpoot to Patel, 1 run","a full, angled delivery ricochets off the inside edge and crashes into the stumps, and they pinch a single as it rolls to fine leg"
2.3,"Rajpoot to Patel, (no ball)","another huge swipe from Parthiv, another play-and-miss, but it's also another no ball. Try again"
2.3,"Rajpoot to Patel, (no ball)","massive swooshing drive from the batsman outside off, and he hits only fresh air. But it's a no-ball! Free hit coming up"
2.2,"Rajpoot to Patel, FOUR runs","picked up over deep backward square! The line, headed towards leg stump, is helpful, and Parthiv helps it on its way with a little flourish, lifting his right leg in the air"
2.1,"Rajpoot to Patel, no run","Parthiv sets himself for a mow into the leg side, but he's not got the room he's looking for and the ball is mis-timed to mid on"
1.6,"Shami to Patel, 1 leg bye","Parthiv misses a swat into the leg side, but the ball loops up off his hip and there's room enough for a quick single"
1.6,"Shami to Patel, 1 wide","Shami's trying not to give him any width, but he's sent his line too far the other way and this one scoots down the leg side"
1.5,"Shami to Patel, FOUR runs","Shami keeps his line straight to Parthiv, but it's too straight and it's neatly clipped down to fine leg for the third four of the over"
1.4,"Shami to Kohli, 1 run","swatted out through cover point again, but a man's been moved out into the deep in that position as damage control"
1.3,"Shami to Kohli, FOUR runs","and again! There was a hint of venom in the last stroke from Kohli, but this one is all class as he leans into a cover drive, on the up, and threads the gap between cover and mid off"
1.2,"Shami to Kohli, FOUR runs","and this will sting after that missed chance! Shami adjusts his line, just outside off, but Kohli meets the ball with a scything slap that sends the ball skidding through cover point. That scorched across the outfield"
1.1,"Shami to Kohli, no run","dropped at midwicket! That was the break Kings XI needed, but Hardus has fluffed a simple chance at midwicket inside the circle. Kohli clipped a full one off the pads, but uppishly and almost straight to him. But it was straight in, and straight out"
0.6,"Rajpoot to Kohli, 1 run",nudges a length ball on off stump to the right of midwicket
0.5,"Rajpoot to Kohli, 2 runs","drills it to the left of point, leaning forward to the good length ball outside off, making sure his balance is going into the shot so he can control it better"
0.4,"Rajpoot to Patel, 1 leg bye","corrects his line now, targeting middle and leg, Parthiv goes for the flick, misses the shot and so has to settle for a leg bye"
0.3,"Rajpoot to Patel, FOUR runs",hammers it down the ground now! Licence to thrill! Or at least licence to swat balls in the slot outside off stump back over mid-off's head
0.2,"Rajpoot to Patel, FOUR runs","a hint of width - only a hint - and Parthiv lashes it behind point with some gusto. The front-foot, on-the-up square drive in all its glory"
0.1,"Rajpoot to Patel, no run","full and outside off, slices it to cover"
19.5,"Sandeep to Jadhav, 1 run","full on off stump, and there's a little bit of drama here but the winning run is eventually taken. Drives it powerfully towards mid-on, except it ends up hitting the non-striker's right foot as he jumps up to evade the ball. The ball ricochets towards the cover fielder, who sprints in, picks up, and underarms a throw at the non-striker's end and hits the stumps direct, but Jadhav was safely home by then"
19.4,"Sandeep to Rayudu, OUT","bouncer over off stump, and Rayudu's fallen with the scores tied! Opens up and looks to pull, but it's a hard one to drag from over his right shoulder, and he ends up miscuing it high, offers a simple catch to Vijay Shankar at mid-off. Vijay Shankar catching Rayudu's just what this match needed, I suppose!"
19.3,"Sandeep to Jadhav, 1 run","shuffles down the pitch, drives this full one outside off firmly to mid-off, who's stationed deep enough to permit a straightforward single"
19.2,"Sandeep to Jadhav, SIX runs","wow, that's another brilliant stop at the boundary from Manish Pandey. Or is it? Jumped down the pitch and turned this ball into a full-toss on the legs. Flicked it and timed it very well, well enough to clear the boundary to the right of deep midwicket. But Pandey, running to his right and jumping past the rope, pulls it back with one hand. But replays show his foot landed before he could paddle the ball back, and that will be six"
19.1,"Sandeep to Rayudu, 1 run","full, angling into leg stump, flicked to short fine leg. If he'd placed that better he might have got four"
18.6,"Ahmed to Jadhav, no run",slower bouncer angling in towards off stump. Jadhav gets into a tangle as he looks to make room and ramp it over the keeper. Can't connect
18.5,"Ahmed to Rayudu, 1 run","length ball, another slower cutter, on off stump. Makes room and punches to deep point"
18.4,"Ahmed to Jadhav, 1 leg bye","back of a length, angling in towards Jadhav's hip, cramping him for room. Plays an awkward pull-flick and misses, gets a leg bye off his thigh pad"
18.3,"Ahmed to Rayudu, 1 run","wide of the crease, bowls this shortish cutter outside off. Makes room and slaps to deep point"
18.2,"Ahmed to Jadhav, 1 run",angles into the pads now and he clips it to long leg
18.1,"Ahmed to Jadhav, no run","offcutter, back of a length, really digs it into the pitch outside off and gets it to rise steeply. Jadhav is half-forward, looking to steer it behind point, and he aborts his shot as the ball climbs at him"
17.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu, no run","looks to step out and make room and Bhuvneshwar cramps him again, angling a shortish offcutter towards leg stump. Flat-bats it back to the bowler"
17.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Jadhav, 1 run","full, angling into leg stump. Saw Jadhav shaping to make room. Pushed to the left of cover"
17.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu, 1 leg bye","jumps out of his crease and Bhuvneshwar tucks him up with a slower short one at his hip. Looks to flick, only manages a bit of thigh pad into the leg side"
17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Jadhav, 1 run","back of a length outside off, chopped away to the left of deep point"
17.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Jadhav, no run","back of a length close to off stump, shuffles across to clip to midwicket"
17.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, OUT","bouncer, rises over Watson's right shoulder. Looks to hook, and doesn't catch it cleanly. There's an appeal for caught-behind from Bhuvneshwar, and it's finally given. Tiny bit of glove on it, and Watson falls four short of what would have been a repeat of his hundred in last year's final. Fantastic knock - he took his time early on, but once he was in, there was no stopping him. Great catch from Bairstow, by the way, diving to his left and completing it with a tumble"
16.6,"Ahmed to Rayudu, 2 runs","slower length ball outside off, Rayudu slices it in the air, with an open face, to the left of deep point"
16.5,"Ahmed to Rayudu, no run","full on off stump, driven to extra-cover"
16.4,"Ahmed to Rayudu, no run","slower ball, fairly full, on off stump. No real front-foot stride as Rayudu looks to compensate with his wrists and drive through cover. Ends up sending a leading edge towards backward point"
16.3,"Ahmed to Watson, 1 run","low full-toss on off stump, punched down to long-on"
16.2,"Ahmed to Watson, SIX runs","short, sits up on an off-stump line, and Watson opens up and pulls it with great power, generated with the swivel through his hips, to send this flying high over the midwicket boundary"
16.1,"Ahmed to Rayudu, 1 run","shortish, close to off stump, gets on the back foot to ease it to deep point"
15.6,"Rashid Khan to Watson, FOUR runs","shot. Super shot. Wrong'un, turning towards leg stump, and he's a big man but he's so quick on his feet here. Opens up at the hips, drops down onto his back knee, and sweep-pulls, with a roll of his wrists on top of the bounce, to send it running away to the left of short fine leg"
15.5,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","full on leg stump, clipped gently into the short fine leg region"
15.4,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","flat, back of a length, slides on with the angle towards middle and leg, goes deep in his crease again to flat-bat to long-on"
15.3,"Rashid Khan to Watson, SIX runs","bam. Tossed up on leg stump, and he clears his front leg and clears long-on by a big distance"
15.2,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 2 runs","short on off stump, and Watson rocks right back in his crease - his back foot is almost on the base of the stumps - and he pulls it in the air, into the gap between deep midwicket and deep backward square leg. Excellent fielding from Pandey running to his right from deep midwicket, pulls it back even as he has both feet in the air over the rope"
15.1,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","back of a length googly, goes back and across and works it through square leg"
14.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","back of a length outside off, there's that wristy late chop again, but this time straight to backward point"
14.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, FOUR runs","slower ball, back of a length, fifth-stump line. It seems to take an age to reach Watson, but that's also because he's in position so early, back foot deep in his crease. He waits and chops it away fine, and finds the gap to the left of short third man"
14.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, FOUR runs","in the blockhole on off stump, and Watson is really seeing them now. Tremendous shot, makes himself room and opens his bat face to squeeze it into the gap between backward point and short third man"
14.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, not short enough to pull, ends up scooping it in the air, but without too much timing, so it drops well short of deep square leg"
14.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu, no run","shortish outside off, extra bounce beats Rayudu as he looks to open his bat face and steer it behind point"
14.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, 1 run","back of a length, angling into middle stump. Makes a lot of room and dabs towards short third man"
13.6,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","shorter now, another wrong'un, flat-bats it down the ground to long-on"
13.5,"Rashid Khan to Watson, no run",quickish wrong'un turning in towards off stump. Gets on the front foot and blocks watchfully
13.4,"Rashid Khan to Watson, SIX runs","low full-toss on middle and leg, and Watson puts it away. Clears his front leg and hoicks it over midwicket"
13.3,"Rashid Khan to Watson, FOUR runs","wrong'un, pitching on a good length outside off. Watson seemed to pick it, sweeps it firmly with the turn and Sandeep, sprinting hard to his left from deep backward square leg, puts in the dive and almost pulls off a good stop, but the ball slips through his fingers and runs away for four"
13.2,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","fuller, angling down leg, sweeps but doesn't middle it. Rolls gently to the right of short fine leg"
13.1,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, FOUR runs","shot! Not that short, on off stump, and he swivelled on his back heel to pull it away to the left of deep midwicket"
12.6,"Shakib to Rayudu, 1 run","tossed up fuller on off stump, driven to sweeper cover"
12.5,"Shakib to Watson, 1 run","there's that inward-curving arm ball again. Watson was stepping away to the leg side to try and make room to cut, and it kept following him and sneaked between his legs"
12.4,"Shakib to Rayudu, 1 run","shorter now, outside off, slapped to sweeper cover"
12.3,"Shakib to Rayudu, no run","saw Rayudu looking to shuffle across his stumps there. He was targeting the fine leg region, and Shakib bowled a slow armer that slid past the attempted sweep and missed leg stump"
12.2,"Shakib to Watson, 1 run","flat, back of a length, on off stump, flat-batted to long-off"
12.1,"Shakib to Rayudu, 1 run","flat length ball angling into leg stump, clipped away into the straight midwicket region, and Shakib does the chasing. Sprints quickly to his right and makes Rayudu hurry through the last few yards of that quick single"
11.6,"Sandeep to Rayudu, 1 run","slower ball, fairly full on off stump. Clipped down to long-on"
11.5,"Sandeep to Watson, 1 run","low full-toss on the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
11.4,"Sandeep to Watson, SIX runs","bang. Sandeep's short balls have been fodder for Watson. This one's outside off, gets up to chest height, and he opens up and heaves it away, high and handsome over the square leg umpire. Brings up his first fifty of the season"
11.3,"Sandeep to Watson, FOUR runs","slower ball, back of a length, outside off. Sits up again, and Watson muscles it off the front-foot to beat deep forward square leg diving to his left"
11.2,"Sandeep to Watson, 2 runs",short ball gets up to shoulder height on off stump. Opens up at the hips and swats it away to the right of deep square leg
11.2,"Sandeep to Watson, 1 wide","round-armish delivery, was looking for the yorker, ends up slinging a low full-toss down the leg side. Watson has a swipe at it but he can't connect"
11.1,"Sandeep to Watson, FOUR runs","short ball outside off, not a lot of width, but it sits up nicely and Watson opens his bat face and jabs it away, into the gap between backward point and short third man"
10.6,"Shakib to Rayudu, no run","flat length ball on off stump, stays back and punches it back to Shakib"
10.5,"Shakib to Watson, 1 run","back of a length, goes with the angle towards leg stump to cramp Watson, who was looking to stay leg-side of the ball. Punched quietly through the covers"
10.4,"Shakib to Rayudu, 1 run","back of a length close to off stump, makes a bit of room and punches to sweeper cover"
10.3,"Shakib to Rayudu, no run","flatter, closer to off stump, driven off the front foot back to the bowler"
10.2,"Shakib to Rayudu, 2 runs","tossed up full on off stump, Rayudu gets on the front foot to chip over the covers. Doesn't really go hard at it, so it hangs in the air for a long time, but drops well short of long-off moving to his left and coming in off the rope"
10.1,"Shakib to Watson, 1 run","short outside off, stops on Watson as he goes on the back foot. Flat-batted down to long-off"
9.6,"Rashid Khan to Raina, OUT","finally has his man and a worthy delivery! Full on middle, Raina didn't pick the googly and was on the walk, missed it completely as he tried to turn it towards midwicket and Bairstow whipped off the bails in a flash"
9.5,"Rashid Khan to Raina, no run","googly on leg stump, Raina is struck on the pad as he misses the sweep"
9.4,"Rashid Khan to Raina, 4 byes","how did that miss the stumps? Leg break this time, Raina swings across the line again and misses, it spun back in and beat the batsman, stumps and the keeper"
9.4,"Rashid Khan to Raina, 1 wide","length around leg stump, slips down and called wide"
9.3,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","length outside off, steered to third-man"
9.2,"Rashid Khan to Raina, 1 run","googly on middle, picked this time and pushed to midwicket"
9.1,"Rashid Khan to Raina, no run","nearly knocks him over! Raina swings across the line, it was the googly on middle, and just missed the off stump"
8.6,"Sandeep to Raina, 1 run","length on middle, doesn't bounce much, Raina pushes it towards deep midwicket for one"
8.5,"Sandeep to Watson, 1 leg bye","length on the pads, the round-arm deliver offering no bounce, which prevents Watson from getting under it as he tries to slog sweep it"
8.4,"Sandeep to Raina, 1 run","slower ball on middle, Raina shuffles across, closes the face and turns it around towards short fine-leg for one"
8.3,"Sandeep to Raina, no run","length on middle, defended"
8.2,"Sandeep to Watson, 1 run","dropped! Bairstow flew to his right but couldn't hang on. It was full outside off, Watson wanted to blast it down the ground, there was slight deviation off the seam which induced the edge, but that's massive opportunity lost"
8.1,"Sandeep to Raina, 1 run","slower ball outside off, pushed to long-off for one"
7.6,"Rashid Khan to Watson, no run","googly, drifting onto the pads, tickled fine but can't beat short fine-leg"
7.5,"Rashid Khan to Raina, 1 run","full outside off, drilled to long-off for one"
7.4,"Rashid Khan to Raina, FOUR runs","length outside off, extra bounce for Rashid but Raina just opens the face and guides it past slip for four"
7.3,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","slightly shorter, hurries onto Watson as he goes for the pull, gets an inside edge back onto the body and they scamper a single"
7.2,"Rashid Khan to Watson, FOUR runs","full on off and drilled down the ground, past the bowler and struck so powerfully that it comfortably bisects long-off and long-on"
7.1,"Rashid Khan to Watson, no run","full on off, Watson is late in coming forward and gets an inside edge onto the pad"
6.6,"Shakib to Watson, 1 run","length on middle, Watson backs away and pushes it to extra cover for one"
6.5,"Shakib to Watson, SIX runs","short again, Watson gets the desired bounce, uses the depth of the crease and pulls it over deep squareleg"

5.6,"Sandeep to Raina, SIX runs","another short ball at the body but there's no pace or bounce to trouble Raina, as he picks it up towards deep squareleg and it hits the boundary cushion on the full"
5.5,"Sandeep to Raina, FOUR runs","slower ball, full on middle, Raina swings hard across the line, doesn't get hold of it but a thick inside edge past short fine-leg is enough for another boundary"
5.4,"Sandeep to Raina, FOUR runs","length outside off, and some luck for Raina as he skips down the wicket, makes a little room, tries to go inside out and gets an outside edge that flies over short third-man"
5.3,"Sandeep to Raina, FOUR runs","slower one on the pads, poor bowling with the fine leg up in the circle, Raina only has to get it past short fine-leg and does it well"
5.2,"Sandeep to Raina, no run","length outside off, driven on the up but straight to extra cover"
5.1,"Sandeep to Raina, FOUR runs","short on middle, and though it's a ball that troubles Raina, not at the pace, he pulls it hard off the front foot and in front of square"
4.6,"Ahmed to Watson, no run","slower ball, angled across, grips a little as Watson swings across the line and misses"
4.5,"Ahmed to Watson, FOUR runs","Watson's on the charge here, slower ball, full outside off, Watson goes over the covers this time and times it perfectly to beat the deep fielder"
4.4,"Ahmed to Watson, SIX runs","short on middle and Watson feasts on this kind of bowling, hammers a pull, flat and hard over deep squareleg"
4.3,"Ahmed to Watson, no run","length on off, pushed to point"
4.2,"Ahmed to Watson, no run","length, angled across, Watson stays rooted to the crease and has a tentative poke as the ball goes past his outside edge"

3.6,"Shakib to Watson, 2 runs","length on middle, Watson swings hard again, only manages a thick inside edge towards deep midwicket but that's good for two"
3.5,"Shakib to Raina, 1 run","length outside off, straighter one again, Raina looks to go through the leg side, anticipating spin back in, it isn't there and he drags it to towards long-on for one off the inside edge"

3.3,"Shakib to Raina, no run","full outside off, arm ball, went straight on, Raina defends with an open face"

2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, OUT","slower ball outside off, drilled to mid-off, du Plessis takes off immediately and has to dive at the no striker's where the stumps have been knocked down by Hooda. That's touch and go! Quite unbelievable that he got that close in the first place, having hit the ball so hard to the fielder, but adjudged just short and SRH have the breakthrough"
2.2,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, no run","full outside off, driven hard to mid-off"

1.1,"Ahmed to du Plessis, no run","full on off, hint of swing back in should encourage him, pushed pack to the bowler off the front foot"
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","another beauty to finish the over, slightly fuller, slightly closer to the off stump, drew him forward and left him audaciously late as he had a tentative poke"
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","length outside off, moving away a little, Watson chases it with his hands again and lucky to not get an outside edge"
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","length around off, pushed to mid-off"
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","length outside off, extra bounce and straightens off the seam again, Watson throws his hands at it and misses"

0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","length on middle, stays back and defends to the leg side"
19.6,"Bravo to Pandey, 2 runs","another yorker, wide one this time, flat-batted down the ground, along the ground to long-off"
19.5,"Bravo to Pathan, 1 run","in the blockhole on middle and leg. Makes room to poke it to extra-cover, who's right on the edge of the circle"
19.4,"Bravo to Pathan, 2 runs","shortish outside off, flat-batted down the ground to the right of long-off, where du Plessis makes a tumbling stop"
19.3,"Bravo to Pathan, 2 runs","full-toss wide of off stump, slapped off the front foot to the right of sweeper cover"
19.2,"Bravo to Pathan, no run","in the blockhole close to off stump. Can't manufacture enough room to jab it through the covers, ends up playing it back to the bowler. Pandey was out of his crease and Bravo threw to his end and missed the stumps, but it went quickly to long-off and no overthrow was possible"
19.1,"Bravo to Pandey, 1 run","full on off stump, clears his front leg and swipes it away to deep midwicket"
18.6,"Chahar to Shankar, OUT","another slower short ball, and this time he can't manufacture either the power or the placement he wants with the front-foot pull, and scoops a catch to deep midwicket"
18.5,"Chahar to Shankar, FOUR runs","slower short ball outside off, and Vijay waits a long time and uses his reach and bottom wrist to pull that off the front foot to the square leg boundary"
18.4,"Chahar to Pandey, 1 run","down the track and Chahar shortens his length. Pandey looks to shovel it over mid-off, and Raina, turning around and running back towards the boundary, drops the ball as it falls into his hands from over his shoulder"
18.3,"Chahar to Shankar, 1 run","slower length ball, can't get enough power on this slog and it bounces well short of midwicket"
18.2,"Chahar to Shankar, no run","well bowled. Slower bouncer, angling in from wide of the crease. Thinks of pulling, but he ends up cramped up and eventually just ducks out of the way"
18.1,"Chahar to Pandey, 1 run","yorker close to off stump, makes a bit of room to try and squeeze it into the covers. The bowler does the fielding, and the two batsmen think about running, then decide not to, but the ball rolls away from Chahar and they eventually complete it"
17.6,"Bravo to Pandey, 1 run","slower ball outside off, fullish, jabbed to extra-cover, who's on the edge of the circle so an easy single is on offer"
17.5,"Bravo to Shankar, 1 run","full outside off, Vijay flat-bats it powerfully, on the bounce, to long-off"
17.4,"Bravo to Shankar, FOUR runs","shot. That's very full, and not far from off stump, and he's gone really deep in the crease with his back foot to be able to create room for elevation, and he's lifted it over the fielder at cover point"
17.3,"Bravo to Pandey, 1 run","off-stump yorker, jams his bat down and digs it out square on the off side"
17.2,"Bravo to Shankar, 1 leg bye","length ball angling slightly down leg. Takes a big step back and across before the bowler releases, and ends up missing his flick. Rolls off the pad for a leg-bye"
17.1,"Bravo to Pandey, 1 run","full, angling in towards leg stump. Looks to clear his front leg and hit over midwicket, ends up inside-edging into his pad"
16.6,"Tahir to Shankar, 2 runs","low full-toss on off stump, gets on the front foot for the push towards long-on. Again the fielder has to come in a long way off the rope, and again they sprint a hard-run two"
16.5,"Tahir to Pandey, 1 run","full now, on middle and leg, whipped to deep square leg"
16.4,"Tahir to Shankar, 1 run","tossed up slow wide of off, legbreak, swipes it against the turn to deep midwicket"
16.3,"Tahir to Pandey, 1 run","back of a length outside off, slapped to sweeper cover"
16.2,"Tahir to Pandey, SIX runs","shot! Drags it a touch short outside off, and Pandey swats it away over the midwicket boundary"
16.1,"Tahir to Pandey, 2 runs","down the track to a fairly flat one on middle stump, drives inside-out and du Plessis has a lot of ground to cover from long-off, to his right and quite a few yards in off the rope"
15.6,"Jadeja to Pandey, 1 run","shortish outside off, slapped to sweeper cover"
15.5,"Jadeja to Shankar, 1 run","again that quick pace, this time just outside off, opens his bat face to dab into the point region"
15.4,"Jadeja to Shankar, no run","flat again, speared in on a length on leg stump. Gets forward, looking to clip through midwicket, but he's forced to play straighter than he'd want and the bowler cuts off the single"
15.3,"Jadeja to Shankar, no run","flat length ball on off stump, gets forward and looks to dab into the covers, but the lack of turn makes him play it too close to the pitch to get a single"
15.2,"Jadeja to Shankar, 2 runs","speared into the pads, clipped through square leg"
15.1,"Jadeja to Shankar, no run","flat one, spinning sharply away from just outside off. Beats the attempted back-foot defensive"
14.6,"Tahir to Pandey, 2 runs","flat length ball outside off, it's the legbreak. Goes for the slog against the turn and doesn't time it at all, which is a good thing because it drops a few yards in front of long-on running in from the rope"
14.5,"Tahir to Shankar, 1 run","tossed up wide of off, reaches out with an open face to steer it to the right of backward point"
14.4,"Tahir to Shankar, no run","full on leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
14.3,"Tahir to Shankar, no run","another wrong'un, flatter and wider. Presses forward and blocks into the on side"

14.1,"Tahir to Pandey, 1 run",flat length ball outside off. Hangs back and dabs it towards short third man

13.5,"Harbhajan to Shankar, 1 run","flatter one spinning in towards off and middle, punched to long-on with the full face showing"
13.4,"Harbhajan to Shankar, 2 runs","tossed up outside off, clipped to the left of deep backward square leg"
13.3,"Harbhajan to Warner, OUT","sharp turn, and Dhoni's appealing for a stumping! And Warner's walking, Nicely bowled by Harbhajan, bowled it slower and held it back a little. It's dropping onto a good length just outside off, not quite full enough for the slog against the turn, and Warner is early on the shot too. The length forces him to reach for the ball, and that causes his back foot to slide out of the crease. The rest is left to Dhoni's fast hands - excellent work, since the ball bounced quite a bit, and he had to rise to his toes to collect the ball and then complete the stumping"
13.2,"Harbhajan to Warner, 2 runs","sees him shaping for the reverse-sweep and bowls it slow and wide of off stump. Warner doesn't have too much pace to work with, but he hits it well enough to hit it in the air and clear short fine leg running back"
13.1,"Harbhajan to Warner, 2 runs","not short enough to pull, rolls away through midwicket off the inside half of the bat. Absoiutely frenetic running to take two there"
12.6,"Jadeja to Pandey, no run","flat length ball outside off stump. Looks to go deep in his crease for the back-foot slice past backward point, but the ball skids on quicker than expected and beats him"
12.5,"Jadeja to Warner, 1 run","not quite short enough to pull, and he miscues but just about clears midwicket turning and running back. A bit of confusion in the running, and there's two quarter-chances for run-outs, first at the bowler's end, and then he throws to the keeper's end, but both batsmen are home"
12.4,"Jadeja to Pandey, 1 run","flat length ball on leg stump, gets forward for the inside-out push to the left of cover"
12.3,"Jadeja to Warner, 1 run",tossed up slower and Warner goes for the old-fashioned heave with the turn. Plays too early and inside-edges past leg stump
12.2,"Jadeja to Pandey, 1 run","flat on leg stump, makes room for the back-foot chop to deep point"
12.1,"Jadeja to Pandey, FOUR runs","and that's some welcome back. Down the track first ball as Jadeja spears one down on leg stump. Skips away from the line to make swinging room, and absolutely monsters it back over the bowler's head"
11.6,"Tahir to Pandey, 1 run","flighted ball wide of off stump, driven to long-off"
11.5,"Tahir to Warner, 1 run","full now, on off stump, clipped with the turn to deep midwicket"
11.4,"Tahir to Pandey, 1 run","flat length ball on leg stump, punched with a straight bat past the bowler, down to long-on. Kept a touch low"
11.3,"Tahir to Pandey, no run","pushed through flat on middle stump, stays leg-side of the ball and punches to short cover"
11.2,"Tahir to Warner, 1 run","wrong'un turning towards middle and off, worked off the back foot to deep midwicket to join his partner on a half-century"

10.6,"Bravo to Pandey, 1 run","shortish, angling into leg stump, tucked into the midwicket region for one"
10.5,"Bravo to Pandey, FOUR runs","short slower one angling into Pandey's hip, and that's nicely played, rolls his wrists over on top of the bounce and helps it to the left of short fine leg. Brings up his fifty too. He's looked so good today, a completely different player to the diffident one from earlier in the season."
10.4,"Bravo to Warner, 1 run","close to the blockhole on off stump, squeezed away into the cover point region"
10.3,"Bravo to Warner, no run","goes for the wide full one, and Warner, who had shaped to make room premeditatedly, ends up too far from the ball and reaches out and misses"
10.2,"Bravo to Pandey, 1 run","full, angling in towards off stump. Looks to drive through the covers but the ball doesn't quite come on, ends up playing it to long-on off the inside half of the bat"
10.2,"Bravo to Pandey, 1 wide","looks to cramp him with a yorker, assuming he'll try to make room, and ends up spearing it a long way down the leg side"
10.1,"Bravo to Pandey, FOUR runs","full on off stump, stays a little leg side of the ball to create room, and he brings his bottom hand into a jab-drive that easily beats deep point to his right"
9.6,"Tahir to Pandey, 1 run","full, driven with the turn to sweeper cover"
9.5,"Tahir to Pandey, 2 runs","fuller and quicker on middle, Pandey attempts the same stroke again but perhaps got too close to it to get elevation and ends up dragging it towards midwicket for a couple"

9.3,"Tahir to Pandey, no run","length outside off, pushed into the off side"

8.2,"Jadeja to Warner, 2 runs","full on middle, comes down the wicket and drills it down the ground, to long-on's right for a couple"
8.1,"Jadeja to Pandey, 1 run","full outside off, pushed to cover and through his legs, which allows a single"

7.1,"Bravo to Warner, no run","length outside off, pushed to cover"
6.6,"Jadeja to Warner, 1 run","length on the pads, Warner helps it along past short fine-leg's right but can't beat deep squareleg as Bravo keeps it down to two"

5.1,"Harbhajan to Warner, 1 run","full on the pads, tucked away towards squareleg"
4.6,"Chahar to Warner, 1 run","slower one outside off, pushed to cover and they take off for one with the stroke, and he had to hurry there at the non striker's end, a direct hit would have probably found him short"
4.5,"Chahar to Warner, no run","slower one, banged half way into the surface, left alone by Warner"
4.4,"Chahar to Pandey, 3 runs","full and angled in, Pandey uses his wrists this time and flicks it between mdwicket and mid-on, the timing wasn't as good as the previous shot and teased du Plessis all the way to the boundary, before he pulled it in with a slide to keep it to three"

0.1,"Chahar to Warner, no run","full on middle, nice shape into the batsman, defended back to the bowler"
19.2,"Unadkat to Pant, SIX runs","short, and he has gone towards midwicket, and sealed the match for Delhi Capitals! It seems the ball has hit the boundary skirting on the full, and that should be the win. This was dug in short by Unadkat, and Pant held back and then whacked it with all the power at his disposal. What a good knock this has been from him. Mixed caution with some innovation, and took his chances when they presented themselves"
19.1,"Unadkat to Ingram, 1 run","slower ball, and he cuts this away towards third man. Gets the outer edge"
18.6,"Archer to Pant, SIX runs","length, and he has walloped this over long on. What a shot, and what a time to pull this off!"
18.5,"Archer to Ingram, 1 run","full ball, and he can only push this towards mid off and picks up a single"
18.4,"Archer to Pant, 3 runs","short, and he has gone for the swat towards the on side. They will pick up three off this!

18.3,"Archer to Ingram, 1 run",full ball and he plays this towards point
18.2,"Archer to Ingram, no run","full ball, and he hammers this back to Archer, who cannot quite stop it. Ingram comes down the wicket, but makes it back as Smith at mid off can't pick it up clean"

16.4,"Gopal to Shaw, OUT","tossed up, and he has played this towards long on, and holed out! Bad shot selection from Shaw here. Delhi were cruising, and Pant was the one who was dominating the bowlers, but he went for the glory shot, and only found Riyan. Smart captaincy, in that he was a few yards within the long on boundary. Is there a twist in the tale here?"

16.1,"Gopal to Pant, (no ball) FOUR runs","full toss, on leg stump, and might be called a no ball for height, and he muscles it away towards long leg"
15.6,"Archer to Shaw, no run","that's hit the bail, but the bail hasn't fallen! It's a full, fast ball, and Shaw was backing away to hit this through covers. It hits the top of leg stump, and stumps light up, but the bail doesn't fall. Incredible!"
15.5,"Archer to Pant, 1 run","full ball, and he taps this towards short cover and goes through for a single"
15.4,"Archer to Pant, SIX runs","full ball, and he has flicked this towards long leg for six. Terrific shot, and brings up a swift fifty for Pant!"

14.5,"Unadkat to Shaw, 1 run","length, outside off, and he slogs this down towards long off"

14.2,"Unadkat to Pant, FOUR runs","short, and he swings this around towards fine leg. The man at short fine leg can only watch as this goes one-bounce through for four. Falling away, one-handed, typically unorthodox from Pant!"
14.1,"Unadkat to Shaw, 1 run","slower ball, and he punches this down towards long on"
13.6,"Kulkarni to Pant, 2 runs","slower ball, outside off, and he whips this away with his wrists towards backward point. Easy couple on offer"

13.2,"Kulkarni to Pant, 2 runs","length ball, slower through the air, and he just pushes this towards long on and picks up two"
13.1,"Kulkarni to Pant, 2 runs","length ball, and he flicks it away towards midwicket. He's hared back for the second, and they've gone upstairs! He's safe, though, as there's a direct hit from the fence"
12.6,"Unadkat to Shaw, no run","slower ball, off-cutter, and Shaw can only defend this"
12.5,"Unadkat to Shaw, SIX runs","full, and he has tonked this over deep midwicket. Superb shot, and it goes several tiers deep inside the fence"

11.6,"Gopal to Pant, SIX runs","full ball, and he has gone down towards deep midwicket, and connected well enough!"
11.5,"Gopal to Shaw, 1 run","full ball, and he flicks this away towards deep midwicket. Stuart Binny down at the fence gets to the ball to his right and rifles in a quick throw, to keep it down to one"
11.4,"Gopal to Pant, 1 run","sweeps a length ball, in the air, but lands short of long leg"
11.3,"Gopal to Pant, 2 runs","short, wide, and he gets down on one knee and slices this away towards backward point. The man at sweeper cover does well to get to the ball and send the throw back in"

11.1,"Gopal to Shaw, FOUR runs","uses his feet to get to a length ball on off stump, and eases this through covers. Beautiful shot!"

0.5,"Steyn to Watson, OUT","got him! Steyn strikes in his first over again, and this time Stoinis holds on at slip. He had dropped Lynn against KKR in Steyn's comeback match.

It spins away from AB, who gets a toe-end while trying to go over the top. Faf stays still at the boundary and catches it over his head. Didn't move his feet and it's safe"

5.2,"Thakur to AB, 1 run","Faf got his fingertips to that one, leaping high at mid-off short ball outside off and AB goes hard at it with a horizontal bat. Doesn't time it well, doesn't get elevation. Faf was at mid-off and jumped but could only get a finger tip"

4.5,"Narine to Warner, 1 bye","what's happened there? Warner played inside the line to one on leg and spinning away, it flicked something and rolled off Karthik's pad even as he was appealing. Beautiful ball but no dismissal there. Didn't hit Warner's pad"
4.4,"Narine to Warner, no run","given room outside off and cuts it, well timed but can't get past the in-field, with cover putting in a dive"

1.5,"Prithvi Raj to Bairstow, FOUR runs","Cariappa clangs a sitter at deep point That would have been such a fairytale debut, but it's not to be. This was again back of length but wider outside off, Bairstow threw his bat at it, and slashed it in the air. Cariappa is positioned perfectly to catch it and it's a comfortable height, but somehow he drops it. In and out of his hands, and what's worse, it goes over the boundary too. Both men ironically playing their first games of the season."

8.2,"Nadeem to Karthik, 1 run, OUT","Karthik has thrown it away he's had several close shaves with a run-out this innings and he's finally out now. There was never a second run there. The ball was given some air and Karthik had worked it to midwicket. Inexplicably, they go for the second with Vijay Shankar swooping down on the ball. The throw is flat, hard and at the stumps and Bairstow has no problems breaking the stumps. Another full-length dive from Karthik but he's still out comfortably. He didn't even wait for the third umpire's decision, but stomped off the ground, clearly unhappy - whether with himself or his partner, who knows."
8.1,"Nadeem to Lynn, 1 run","down the track and patted back to the bowler. Quick thinking from Nadeem there, who gathered the ball and flicked it towards the stumps with DK having taken a start, but it misses and they get a single"
7.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, no run","good length, outside off, he wants to slash it but it goes under his bat. Kept a bit low"
7.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, FOUR runs",outside edge goes very fine to the third man boundary. Not entirely deliberate. Good length in the channel and Karthik opens the face of the bat but gets it a bit higher on the bat than intended. End result works for him though

7.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, no run","good length in the channel, Lynn pushes it back towards mid-off. Early call of 'NO'"
7.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, 1 run","almost run out first ball. good length outside off and Karthik cuts it to point. Hesitates then takes off for a single, Vijay Shankar misses a direct hit. Karthik put in a full length dive, but even that might not have saved him."
7.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rana, OUT","he's got him caught behind Just got a feather on it, but this is a beauty from Bhuvi. Back of a length and in the channel. Of all the SRH bowlers, Bhuvi has got the ball to bounce extra, and that is what does Rana in. He's looking for another dab to third man, but the bounce means he just feathers it behind"
6.6,"Nadeem to Rana, 1 run","fuller and well outside off, Rana moves across and flicks it to long-on"

5.4,"Sandeep to Rana, FOUR runs","lovely too full and given a bit of room outside off and he leans into a textbook cover drive. Stroked it beautifully and Nadeem was chasing after it, but the ball just beats him to the fence"

4.4,"Ahmed to Lynn, 1 run","good length, angling across, pushed towards point and they take a quick single. Lynn had to scramble to make his ground after being a little late to respond to Rana's call"
4.3,"Ahmed to Rana, 1 run","back of a length outside off, dabbed to third man"
4.2,"Ahmed to Gill, OUT","straight to point soft dismissal and Gill won't be happy with that. Fuller on off, and he leaned into the drive while opening the face, but steered it to the fielder, who only had to take a couple of steps to pouch it."

2.5,"Ahmed to Gill, 1 run","good length on off, patted with soft hands to mid-off and he calls Lynn through for the quick single"
2.4,"Ahmed to Narine, OUT","knocked him over But Narine has done his job. Slower ball has got him. Off-cutter that pitches on off, Narine was anticipating a quick and short one perhaps, had cleared his front leg to go over cow corner. Too early into the shot and connects with air. The ball connects with the middle stump"
2.3,"Ahmed to Narine, FOUR runs",carnage from Narine low full toss outside off now and he carves it over cover for a sweetly timed four
2.2,"Ahmed to Narine, FOUR runs","and Narine's confidence is up now. This is a better ball, shorter  and rising up higher outside off, but Narine has the room to pull it from outside off to the midwicket boundary"
2.1,"Ahmed to Narine, SIX runs","greeted with a six! that's a free gift for Narine, short and wide outside off, and he gleefully slashes it over point"
1.6,"Nadeem to Lynn, SIX runs","just clears Vijay Shankar at long-on fuller, and Lynn goes for the lofted drive aiming for maximum. Didn't time it all that well though, but hit it powerfully enough to just about clear a leaping Vijay"

1.4,"Nadeem to Narine, 1 run",mis-field by Yusuf at mid-off given air outside off and Narine drives it well but straight to Yusuf. Poor fielding to let it slip through

1.2,"Nadeem to Lynn, 1 run","fuller, but on the pads and Lynn works it between mid-on and midwicket"
1.1,"Nadeem to Lynn, FOUR runs","starts off with a bad ball, too short, sat up to be spanked and Lynn obliged, powering it through cover. All the time in the world to play that"
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Narine, FOUR runs","and a poor one to finish, back of a length again but on leg stump and not quite rising as high. Narine swivels to pull it off his hips to the square leg boundary"
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Narine, no run","good ball, back of a length and rising while going past Narine, right outside off. He keeps his hands down and lets it go through. That's the length to bowl to Narine, and not give him room"
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Lynn, 1 run","goes back to a stump to stump line, but gets it to move in and end up on the pads, and Lynn pats it towards mid-on for a single"

19.4,"Sam Curran to Iyer, FOUR runs","back of a length, swatted across the line and he's picked out the gap at midwicket. Delhi get over the line. They've won a match at home, though they stumbled and fumbled and wobbled and weaved at the finish line. But they got over it, which is what counts. They move clear of KXIP in the points table. Iyer will be pleased to have seen this through. No second miracle for Curran and Punjab, but they still managed to drag it out till the last over - commendable given Delhi's position"
19.3,"Sam Curran to Iyer, 2 runs","slashed this over cover, gets a thick outside edge but it falls safely and they take two. Risky shot, but fortune was with him"
19.2,"Sam Curran to Rutherford, 1 run","smashed back with incredible power straight over the bowler, but long-off runs in and collects on the bounce. Great work from Miller. Rutherford thought it was a boundary and only set off for a run late"

18.4,"Shami to Axar Patel, 1 run, OUT","there's a collision and a run out, it looks like this was a length ball on the pads and Axar tucked it to deep square leg and called for two. Shami had finished his follow through and was in a legitimate position at the edge of the pitch, watching the ball. Axar turned around and half-collided with him, which meant he wasn't in time to beat the throw. He's not happy. Shami shrugs and says he didn't come in the way. And he's right"
18.3,"Shami to Ingram, OUT","knocked him over Ingram wanted to finish it off in a hurry perhaps, danced down the track to drive and ends up yorking himself. Ball screams through and knocks the middle stump out of the ground. Still time for a twist?"
18.2,"Shami to Iyer, 1 run","short ball into the body, he pulls to deep midwicket to raise fifty"
18.1,"Shami to Iyer, no run","back of a length outside off, moving away. Iyer wanted to steer it, but ends up feeling for it, with the ball going past edge"
17.6,"Viljoen to Ingram, FOUR runs","Ingram's taking charge. He's not going to allow another botched chase on his watch. Super shot this, gave himself room and drove it from his toes through extra cover."
17.5,"Viljoen to Ingram, FOUR runs","he's in perfect control is Ingram. Short ball, off-cutter and he swivels to pull this off his hips and to the square leg boundary. Doing it calmly"

16.5,"Shami to Ingram, 1 run",flays at this full one outside off and a thick outside edge rolls to third man
16.4,"Shami to Iyer, 1 bye","good work by Rahul behind the stumps. Iyer backs away to have a thrash at it through extra cover, but the bowler follows and goes between bat and pad. Because he has moved away so much it's well down leg side but Rahul dives and stops the ball"

15.6,"Viljoen to Ingram, FOUR runs","good shot, picked his spot. Back of a length, seemed to hold in the pitch again, but Ingram was in position to pull and does it by going over the in-field. Once bounce in the midwicket fence. He placed it where no fielder was there"

15.2,"Viljoen to Iyer, 1 run","dug it into the pitch short outside off, doesn't come on to the bat, he stays in his crease and slaps it to extra cover"
15.1,"Viljoen to Pant, OUT","caught by Curran at deep square leg. Could it be  could it be ? Tried to fetch a pull from outside off to a ball that didn't really bounce all that much, ends up getting more height than distance. Curran has to merely take a few steps to get into position and gobble it up."
14.6,"Sam Curran to Iyer, FOUR runs","clears his front leg and slashes it. Length ball on the stumps, wasn't in perfect control but the thick edge takes it to the point boundary"

13.3,"Viljoen to S Dhawan, OUT","Ashwin takes a tumbling catch while avoiding Gayle back of a length off-cutter, and Dhawan wanted to pull it hard, but because of the movement, he got it off the toe-end and sends it up swirling in the air to deep midwicket. Ashwin ran back and had it well covered, but Gayle was also converging. In the end, Ashwin did well to hold on to it and avoid a collision with Gayle. Ashwin ran from mid-on, Gayle was running back from midwicket"
13.2,"Viljoen to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","too short on off, and he pulls it off his hips to deep square leg. didn't time it perfectly, but placed it well"

1.4,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, no run","over the wicket, pitched up at 137kph, no swing as Dhawan dances down and cracks the ball to point on the bounce"
1.3,"Sam Curran to Shaw, 1 run","touch short and whipped away into the leg side, sounded sweet off the bat but the man in the deep comes around"
1.2,"Sam Curran to Shaw, FOUR runs","length ball, stand-and-delivered back over the bowler's head! Crunchy shot for a straight four, Curran too easy-paced for that length"
1.1,"Sam Curran to Shaw, no run","round the wicket, back of a length and he again swings at it and misses"

0.1,"Shami to Shaw, no run","length ball, nips touch as it hits the seam and Shaw has a waft, plays around it outside off"
19.6,"Rabada to Harpreet Brar, SIX runs","what a finish! Harpreet has been impressive in his first IPL outing. Was ready for the short and fast bouncer, pulls it from shoulder height and connects beautifully, sending it soaring over square leg."
19.5,"Rabada to Viljoen, 1 bye","slower ball, length outside off. Misses the pull but they run anyway and take a bye. This time Pant relays the ball to Rabada, who stops it with his feet and doesn't attempt another under-arm"
19.4,"Rabada to Viljoen, 2 runs","slower ball, Viljoen comes on the front foot to whip it with his wrists to deep midwicket. Slide and save keeps them to two"
19.3,"Rabada to Viljoen, 2 byes","they've stolen two byes off a slower bouncer! Viljoen ducked under it and it went straight to Pant. He still decided to take off for a single. Pant relays to Rabada, who misses the stumps while under-arming and they take a second"
19.2,"Rabada to Harpreet Brar, 1 run","another short ball, 144 kph, Harpreet goes to pull but doesn't get hold of it. The ball pops up towards a vacant mid-on region, so safe"
19.1,"Rabada to Ashwin, OUT","short ball does it. Ashwin was backing away to give himself room and swat through the legside, but Rabada had seen that in his last over and bowled a pacy short one closer to the batsman, denying him room. He goes through with the pull anyway but gets it near the end of the bat, and the ball loops to long-on, where Shreyas Iyer takes a good low catch tumbling forward"
18.6,"Sharma to Ashwin, 1 run","he was giving himself room but Ishant follows him. Ashwin equal to it though, clips it off his toes to long-on"

17.6,"Rabada to Ashwin, no run","the bowler responds with a pacy back of length ball that almost cuts him in half. Backing away to make room again, but can't lay bat on ball"
17.5,"Rabada to Ashwin, FOUR runs","swatted. Clever shot by Ashwin, was moving about in his crease and Rabada went for the short one. But he had cleared his front leg and given himself space so he could club a pull shot and place it well, wide of midwicket"
17.4,"Rabada to Harpreet Brar, 1 run","back of a length just outside off, he stands tall again and punches. A hint of vintage Yuvraj in that, but doesn't get the timing right. Goes to mid-off"

16.3,"Axar Patel to Mandeep, OUT","got him Mandeep gave him the charge, but Axar out-smarted him, and fired it in well wide of off stump - though within the tramlines. Pant collects and whips off the bails."

14.6,"Lamichhane to Mandeep, 1 run","dropped by Rabada diving forward at deep square too short and Mandeep's eyes probably lit up. went at it hard, pulling off the back foot but didn't connect sweetly. Rabada put in the dive but couldn't hold on. Lamichhane ends with 3 for 40"

13.5,"Mishra to Mandeep, 2 runs",too short and Mandeep rocks back to pull this powerfully to deep midwicket. Hit too well almost so he has to sprint back to make the second run
13.4,"Mishra to Mandeep, no run","ooh, that had him caught in two minds. Drifts on leg and spins sharply across, kept out at the last moment"

12.4,"Lamichhane to Sam Curran, no run","good bowling, gets it drift across and turn into Curran who can only push it back"
12.3,"Lamichhane to Sam Curran, no run","another wrong un, Curran didn't really read it, came on the front foot and defends with soft hands"
12.2,"Lamichhane to Gayle, OUT","relay catch on the boundary and that's a huge moment They're checking upstairs, but Gayle is walking. Bowled from much behind the stumps, wrong 'un that bounced a little bit more, Gayle rocks back and pulls powerfully. Ingram at deep midwicket catches it over his head, and he's overbalancing  overbalancing, but spots Axar a good ten yards away. Just in the nick of time, lobs the ball to Axar, who has a wide smile on his face while catching it. Amazing work by Ingram there."
12.1,"Lamichhane to Gayle, SIX runs","that one needs to be fetched from way into the crowd He seemed to have pre-decided to attack Lamicchane, decent enough ball outside off but he gets down on one knee and slogs sweeps it into oblivion"
11.6,"Rabada to Mandeep, no run",ooh that kept a bit low. Slower ball by Rabada's standards at 128 kph and Mandeep was too early on the pull. Good length outside off and goes under his bat to the keeper

4.5,"Rabada to Agarwal, OUT","dug in short, Agarwal hacks across the line, Rutherford holds on to the top edge! That was an unequal five-ball contest, Rabada the winner by knockout as Agarwal's wild swing failed to get beyond the ring - though it took some catching, as the ball practically came down with ice on it"

19.1,"Malinga to Binny, FOUR runs","full-toss angling down leg. It's the attempted yorker, it's dipping late, and Binny doesn't really know much about it, but he plays a blind flick at it, and gets a little tickle on it - or not - onto his pad, and the ball runs away to the fine leg boundary to bring up victory"
18.6,"Bumrah to Binny, 1 run","back of a length outside off, looks to slap it through the covers, the angle makes him hit it towards mid-off off the inside half of the bat. Pollard's too deep again to prevent the single"

18.2,"Bumrah to Binny, 1 run","shortish, angling into the front hip, tucked away into the square leg region"
18.1,"Bumrah to Turner, OUT","make that 0, 0, 0, 0. Bumrah's deadly inward angle and skiddiness does in another batsman. Turner's front leg moves half-forward and across the stumps, and he ends up playing around his front pad looking to work it into the leg side.

17.5,"Pandya to Smith, FOUR runs","that's a pressure-relieving boundary. Short, just a bit of width, and Smith leans back and cracks a square-cut past the left hand of the diving backward point fielder"
17.4,"Pandya to Smith, 1 run, OUT","length ball angling into off stump, clipped away to the left of deep midwicket, and is that a run-out at the bowler's end?

17.3,"Pandya to Smith, no run","nicely bowled. Saw Smith trying to make himself room and bowls a wide slower ball, quite full. Reaches out to flat-bat it, but can't put any power on it. Hits it straight to short cover"

16.5,"Bumrah to Smith, 2 runs","full outside off, angling in from wide of the crease. Smith leans forward, looking for the cover drive. Plays a little early and the angle causes the ball to run away through midwicket off the inside half of the bat. That shot brings up his fifty"

16.3,"Bumrah to Parag, 1 run","bouncer, rising head-high and angling in from wide of the crease. Steps across to hook, and he's beaten for pace. Off the badge of the helmet, and it pops up and drops down into the long leg region"
16.2,"Bumrah to Smith, 1 run","full, on the pads, clipped to long leg"
16.1,"Bumrah to Smith, FOUR runs","back of a length close to off stump, and that's sensational timing from Smith.

15.4,"Malinga to Parag, no run","that's a Malinga special. A dipping yorker that swerves away late in its trajectory. Parag looks to open his bat face and squeeze it past point, but the late swing beats his edge"
15.3,"Malinga to Smith, 1 run","shortish outside off, uses his wrists to play a bottom-handed pull-whip to deep midwicket"
15.2,"Malinga to Parag, 1 run","length ball wide of off stump, Parag plays a wristy drive out to deep cover point"

13.4,"Pandya to Parag, FOUR runs","shot. The pressure was mounting on Parag, and he finds a way to the boundary. Pandya was getting a little predictable with his length and angle in from wide of the crease, and Parag just jumped across his stumps and used that angle to scoop the ball over short fine leg"
13.3,"Pandya to Parag, no run","back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Looks to make room but the angle cramps him, and he ends up flat-batting it back to the bowler. Wanted to hit it through cover"
13.2,"Pandya to Smith, 1 run","in the blockhole, angling down leg. Looks to get his front pad away from the line and flick, but can't make contact. Rolls off the boot into the backward point region. Was there an inside edge? Maybe"

12.2,"Bumrah to Parag, no run","big shout for lbw, but is there an inside edge? Rohit Sharma thinks so, so there's no review. Smartly bowled by Bumrah - he knows Parag has been sitting deep in his crease, looking to set himself up for the pull. The attempted yorker, angling in from wide of the crease, ends up as a full-toss that hits him on the pad, but there's a tickle of inside edge along the way while he tries to flick it away"
12.1,"Bumrah to Smith, 1 run","length ball angling into off stump, shuffles across to work it through square leg"
11.6,"Pandya to Smith, 1 run","and again, angles it in from wide of the crease. This time he sits leg-side of the ball and looks to slap it through point, but the ball stops on him and he hits it into the covers without much power at all"
11.5,"Pandya to Smith, no run","shortish, again goes wide of the crease to angle it in. Not as short as Smith would like, and he inside-edges the pull into his back thigh pad"
11.4,"Pandya to Smith, no run","back of a length, goes wide of the crease and angles this slower ball in towards off stump. Shuffles across, looking to work it leg side, but it takes an age getting to him and he can only jab it back towards the bowler"
11.3,"Pandya to Parag, 1 run","again goes deep in his crease to a shortish delivery outside off, plays a flat-bat swat down the ground to long-on"
11.2,"Pandya to Parag, no run","back of a length outside off, goes back again to flat-bat to mid-off"
11.1,"Pandya to Parag, 2 runs","back of a length outside off, rocks deep in his crease and pulls to the right of long-on. Pollard fields and fires a direct hit at the striker's end, but there's no one around to back up and they sneak an overthrow"
10.6,"Krunal to Parag, 1 run","quickish length ball with a bit of in-drift towards middle stump, nudged into the vacant midwicket region and the bowler has to sprint there to mop up"
10.5,"Krunal to Smith, 1 run","fuller now, on leg stump, driven to long-on"
10.4,"Krunal to Smith, 2 runs","back of a length on off stump, swatted away to the left of deep midwicket"
10.3,"Krunal to Parag, 1 run","ooh, flatter, and he misreads the length. Goes back, playing the trajectory and looking to pull from around off stump. Skids on and hurries him into a short-arm jab to long-on"
10.2,"Krunal to Parag, FOUR runs","a bit slower, angled into leg stump this time, and he quickly opens up and gets down on his back knee to slog-sweep to the left of deep midwicket"
10.1,"Krunal to Parag, no run","flat length ball angling into off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
9.6,"Chahar to Parag, 1 run",taps a short-of-a-length delivery to the leg side

9.1,"Chahar to Smith, no run","back of a length at off stump, Smith a little squared up as he defends to cover"

8.2,"Markande to Smith, no run",the bottom hand comes off the bat as he drives to cover
8.1,"Markande to Smith, no run","full at off stump, pushed back to the bowler"
7.6,"Chahar to Stokes, OUT","dragged on! A gamechanging over? Not the best of shots from Stokes, looking to cut this from tight on off stump, gets a bottom edge into the stumps. But was another lovely piece of bowling. Gripped and spun back into Stokes to further cramp the shot"
7.5,"Chahar to Stokes, no run","short of a length, skids through and keeps low, Stokes has to quickly get the bat down"
7.4,"Chahar to Smith, 1 run","very short, played off the back foot to long-off"
7.3,"Chahar to Smith, no run","full and straight, defended coming forward"
7.2,"Chahar to Samson, OUT","caught at long-on! It was all looking so good for Samson. Well bowled by Chahar, was brave enough to give it some air, Samson tried to launch it straight, sliced across the shot and provided Pollard a simple catch"
7.1,"Chahar to Smith, 1 run","short of a length, straight, worked to square leg"
6.6,"Markande to Samson, SIX runs","stand and deliver! Stays in his crease, frees his arms through a full delivery outside off, lofts it over cover/wide long-off"

6.4,"Markande to Samson, 1 run",worked off the pads to deep midwicket
6.3,"Markande to Smith, 1 run",taps a good-length delivery to the off side
6.2,"Markande to Smith, SIX runs","oh, what a stroke! Uses his feet and plays a wonderful whip over the leg side, goes all the way over wide long-on jeepers, that was a good shot"
6.1,"Markande to Smith, no run","full at off stump, driven to point"
5.6,"Malinga to Smith, 1 run","gets across to off stump, the bottom hand takes over as he plays a bottom-handed whip to deep square"
5.5,"Malinga to Smith, FOUR runs","what a shot! That's the best of Smith. Back of a length outside off, driven sweetly square of the wicket through point"
5.4,"Malinga to Smith, 2 runs","fuller, at the pads, flicked to deep square"
5.3,"Malinga to Smith, FOUR runs","strong shot! Some width outside off, he powers through the line and slices it through backward point to third man"

5.1,"Malinga to Samson, no run","back of a length outside off, a cutter, holds in the pitch and is pushed uncertainly back to the bowler"
4.6,"Bumrah to Smith, no run","short of a length, shapes in to middle and off, defended to the on side"
4.5,"Bumrah to Smith, 2 runs","goes deep in the crease, tucks a straight delivery into midwicket and placed nicely for the second"

4.2,"Bumrah to Samson, no run","short of a length, angled in at off stump, defended on the back foot"
4.1,"Bumrah to Smith, 1 run","back of a length at off stump, thickish inside edge to the leg side"
3.6,"Chahar to Samson, FOUR runs","that's another lovely shot, just started to move to leg but then didn't go, Chahar bowled at leg stump and Samson went down to paddle it very fine"
3.5,"Chahar to Smith, 1 run","short on the pads, whipped to deep square leg"
3.4,"Chahar to Rahane, OUT","caught at cover! Chahar hits back. Full at off stump, just held in the pitch enough, Rahane came forward and couldn't keep his push down"
3.3,"Chahar to Rahane, no run","better length, at the stumps, defended"
3.2,"Chahar to Rahane, FOUR runs","back-to-back boundaries as he goes down and sweeps firmly off a good length, straighter delivery, sends it in the air to deep backward square"
3.1,"Chahar to Rahane, FOUR runs","short of a length outside off, cuts firmly and bisects the men at short third man and backward point"
2.6,"Malinga to Rahane, 1 run","angled into the pads, glanced backward of square"

2.4,"Malinga to Samson, no run","short of a length, another slower one, grips a touch on the surface, played to midwicket"
2.3,"Malinga to Samson, 4 byes","oops! A lovely slower ball, defeats Samson's attempt to angle it away, reaches de Kock on the second bounce and he can't take it. Bonus runs"
2.2,"Malinga to Rahane, 1 leg bye","short of a length, big appeal for lbw from Malinga as Rahane whips across the line and Rohit calls the review with a few seconds to spare. Looked high to start with and it looks even higher on the replay, and he's almost off the ground as he plays it. Poor review. Going miles over the stumps"
2.1,"Malinga to Rahane, no run","full at the stumps, defended to the bowler"
1.6,"Krunal to Samson, FOUR runs","that's just as good! He's looking a million dollars at the moment. Stays still this time, drives with a slightly open face and threads the gap through the covers, wide of long-off. Such timing."
1.5,"Krunal to Samson, FOUR runs",wonderful shot! That's so classy takes a step outside leg stump then drives inside-out over extra cover. Could watch that all day
1.4,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run","fired in as a low full toss, clipped to the leg side"
1.3,"Krunal to Samson, 1 run",gets forward and flicks a good-length ball to deep midwicket
1.2,"Krunal to Samson, FOUR runs","floated up at leg stump, Samson gives himself a touch of room, allows him to free his arms, lofts it straight down the ground"
1.1,"Krunal to Rahane, 1 run","round the wicket, full and straight, pushed to long-on"
0.6,"Pandya to Samson, no run","beats the edge this one, just a little shape away, playing away from his body looking for another glide to third man but wasn't in as much control"
0.5,"Pandya to Samson, FOUR runs","that's a very clever shot, a touch wider outside off, short of a length, angles it fine of short third man"
0.4,"Pandya to Samson, FOUR runs","short of a length at off stump, a bit of a hack across the line but it's very effective as he sends it to deep midwicket"

0.2,"Pandya to Rahane, no run","a fraction fuller, outside off, Rahane makes a small press forward and defends to point"
0.1,"Pandya to Rahane, no run","back of a length at off stump, defended to the covers"
19.6,"Archer to Cutting, SIX runs","length ball angling into off stump, and finally Cutting gets one right in his zone. Clears his front leg and absolutely wallops this over the forward square leg boundary. Mighty hit to end the innings, and it takes Mumbai past 160 on a slow, tricky pitch"
19.5,"Archer to Cutting, no run","shortish, wide of off. Grips on the pitch and nips away a little like a legcutter. Slashes hard and is beaten by the movement and lack of pace"
19.4,"Archer to Krunal, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and carves it away to deep point"
19.3,"Archer to Cutting, 1 run","in the blockhole on off stump, low full-toss but low enough to count as a yorker. Stabbed down to long-off"
19.2,"Archer to Krunal, 1 run","back of a length, straightens a little in the corridor close to off stump. Lets it come on and drops it into the cover point region for a quick single"
19.1,"Archer to Pandya, OUT","well, we have a review for lbw first ball! Yorker, and Pandya plays all around it, looking to flick it away. Given not out, and Smith reviews without too much hesitation. Hits him on the front boot  Impact in line with middle and leg, and ball-tracking says it'll crash into leg stump. Bye bye, Hardik"
18.6,"Unadkat to Cutting, 2 runs","another slower ball, nipping away towards off stump. Cutting clears his front leg and looks to hit over the leg side. Miscues, slices off the outside half of the bat, but it lands well short of the fielder coming in off the long-on boundary"
18.5,"Unadkat to Pandya, 1 run","in the blockhole on off stump, jams his bat down to dig it out to extra-cover"
18.4,"Unadkat to Pandya, SIX runs","poor Unadkat. Slower length ball pitching on the stumps and spinning away from them. Super shot from Pandya, brings down a straight bat and scoops the ball back over the bowler's head, gets it to carry all the way"
18.3,"Unadkat to Pandya, 2 runs","ARCHER DROPS ANOTHER! Slower short ball just outside off, and Pandya miscues his front-foot pull. Archer again comes in from the midwicket boundary and dives forward. Again he gets both his hands to it, and again he fails to grab on"
18.3,"Unadkat to Pandya, 1 wide","again he goes for that wide line, and ends up slanting the ball too wide. Attempted slower one this time"
18.2,"Unadkat to Pandya, FOUR runs","wide and full, and Hardik throws his bat at it and gets a thick edge on it. Third man is up in the circle and the ball flies between that fielder and the diving Samson behind the stumps"
18.1,"Unadkat to Pandya, 2 runs","slower ball, back of a length, slanting away from off stump. Flat-batted to the left of long-off, no real power on it"
18.1,"Unadkat to Pandya, 1 wide","looks for the wide yorker, ends up slanting it way too wide. Hardik leaves it alone - not much else he could have done"
17.6,"Archer to Cutting, no run","now the slower short ball, considerably slower than the previous ball, outside off. Swings too early through his pull and fails to make contact. Concedes just five off the over despite starting it with a boundary"
17.5,"Archer to Cutting, no run","stump-high full-toss on off stump. Was looking for the yorker but missed his length. Still a hard ball to deal with at Archer's pace, and all Cutting can do is jab it back to the bowler"
17.4,"Archer to Cutting, no run","slower ball, back of a length, fourth-stump line. Stops on the pitch and Cutting is through his punch early. Wants to play it through the covers, plays it back to the bowler in the end"
17.3,"Archer to Cutting, no run","fast, effortless off-stump yorker. Jabbed back to the bowler"
17.2,"Archer to Pandya, 1 run","length ball on off stump, driven to long-off"
17.1,"Archer to Pandya, FOUR runs","shot. Strays onto the pads, and Hardik likes the opportunity to use his wrists, whips it away up and over short fine leg, and deep backward square leg has little chance running to his right"
16.6,"Unadkat to Cutting, FOUR runs","what a shot that is! Slower ball, back of a length, fifth-stump line, and you'd think there's very little pace for Cutting to work with, but he lets it come on, and just dabs it away to the left of backward point, and somehow sends it speeding away over the outfield even as the fielder gives chase"
16.5,"Unadkat to Pollard, OUT","got him, huge wicket. Another slower cutter, aiming at middle stump. Pollard gets on the front foot for another big hit, plays slightly across it - looking to go over midwicket rather than long-on - and ends up playing early, creating a big gap for the ball to barge through"
16.4,"Unadkat to Pollard, SIX runs","back of a length on off stump, clears his front leg and hoicks it away, effortlessly, over the midwicket boundary"
16.3,"Unadkat to Pandya, 1 run","dropped. Archer puts down his second of the match. It seemed to be in the slot for the big hit from Hardik, full and angling across towards off stump. Clears his front leg and goes for it, but it's the slower cutter and he doesn't quite time it. Archer comes in off the deep midwicket boundary, slides forward and gets his hands under the ball, but can't hold on"
16.2,"Unadkat to Pollard, 1 run","back of a length slower one, aiming to tuck Pollard up. Worked quietly off the hip through backward square leg"
16.1,"Unadkat to Pollard, 2 runs","full, angling across towards off stump, punched to the left of long-off"
15.6,"Archer to Pandya, no run","excellent finish to an excellent over. Sharp bouncer, angling in from wide of the crease, homing in on Hardik's helmet. Keeps his eye on the ball and sways out of the way. A less quick bowler may have given him time to attempt a ramp, but not so in Archer's case"
15.5,"Archer to Pollard, 1 run","full, angling in towards off stump, pushes to the left of cover and takes off, and there's a direct hit at the striker's end  Looks like Hardik's just made it, nice stretch at the end. Rahane with the throw from cover"
15.4,"Archer to Pollard, no run","in the blockhole on off stump, jams his bat down and squeezes it out to midwicket"
15.3,"Archer to Pandya, 1 run","full slower one, angling in towards off stump, shows the full face to drive to long-on"
15.2,"Archer to Pandya, no run","fullish outside off, looks to drive towards mid-off and short extra-cover moves to his right to intercept"
15.1,"Archer to Pandya, no run","back of a length outside off, looks to open his bat face and guide it to third man but doesn't get it to slide off his bat with too much pace. Backward point moves to his left and stops it"
14.6,"Gopal to Pollard, no run","full flighted ball on middle stump, defended inside-out to short extra-cover"
14.5,"Gopal to Pandya, 1 run","back of a length, at Pandya's left hip, whipped away to long leg"
14.4,"Gopal to Pandya, no run","lovely. Quick legbreak just outside off, with just enough air on it to draw Pandya forward. Looks to defend but it dips and turns and zips past his outside edge"
14.3,"Gopal to de Kock, OUT","wrong'un, short one, pitching on off stump and spinning further away. Looks to fetch a pull from a long way outside off stump and only manages to slice it high in the air and into the waiting hands of the long-on fielder"
14.2,"Gopal to de Kock, no run","flatter now, slanted across to off stump, makes room to cut but can't beat backward point"
14.1,"Gopal to de Kock, 2 runs","tossed up, floated across towards off stump, and he gets down low to sweep to the left of long leg, where Binny makes an excellent sprinting, diving save at the boundary"
13.6,"Binny to de Kock, 1 run","shortish, angling across to off stump, pulled down the ground to long-on"
13.5,"Binny to Yadav, OUT","there's the answer. Dhawal Kulkarni's on the fine leg boundary, and he runs to his right and takes a simple one after Suryakumar miscues a hook off a Binny bouncer that gets up over his right shoulder"
13.4,"Binny to Yadav, 2 runs","back-of-a-length slowie this time, pulled from outside off, in the air, but bounces well short of the fielder, to the right of long-on"
13.3,"Binny to Yadav, FOUR runs","loopy slower ball, fuller this time, full enough for Suryakumar to swing through the line and hit it back down the ground, over the non-striker's head and to the left of long-on"
13.2,"Binny to Yadav, no run","slower ball again, fuller this time, again in that fifth-stump corridor. Goes for the big slog and misses"
13.1,"Binny to Yadav, no run","short, wide slower ball, takes ages to reach the batsman, by which time he's already played a futile air-slash"
12.6,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run","low full toss, straight, driven to long-off"
12.5,"Gopal to de Kock, 1 run","very full outside off, shapes for the slog-sweep but it goes quite straight towards long-on"
12.4,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run","it's a wrong 'un again, whipped in the air, one bounce to deep midwicket"
12.3,"Gopal to de Kock, 1 run","very short outside off, another googly, lack of pace off the pitch helps the bowler as de Kock only sends it to long-off"
12.2,"Gopal to de Kock, no run","is he stumped? Beaten outside off by a shorter, flatter delivery. Think he's managed to push the foot back across the line, he's done well there"
12.1,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run","full at leg stump, driven to long-on"
11.6,"Unadkat to Yadav, 1 run","risky line, short on the hip, but it's only a single as he flicks to long leg Royals won't mind him keeping the strike"
11.5,"Unadkat to de Kock, 1 run","a slower ball, at the stumps, nudged into midwicket has a decent chance for a hundred"
11.4,"Unadkat to de Kock, SIX runs","that's a beauty! Sounded very sweet off the bat and went miles back over deep midwicket. Was in the arc, good length at the stumps, and it was a lovely swing of the bat"
11.3,"Unadkat to Yadav, 1 run","tries something here, sweeping a back-of-a-length ball which is adventurous gets a top edge into his body. And then gets whacked on the back by the throw for good measure"
11.2,"Unadkat to de Kock, 1 run","back of a length, clubbed through the line down to long-on where Stokes is very swift"
11.1,"Unadkat to de Kock, no run",a fresh-air shot as he swings to the leg side against a short-of-a-length delivery outside off
10.6,"Gopal to Yadav, 2 runs","a little shorter, he plays back and lofts it straight down the ground neatly between long-on and long-off"
10.5,"Gopal to Yadav, no run","full at off stump, whips through a square cut which finds backward point"
10.4,"Gopal to de Kock, 1 run",goes back in the crease and takes this from outside off to deep midwicket
10.3,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run",whipped off the pads to deep midwicket
10.2,"Gopal to de Kock, 1 run","touch short outside off, doesn't bounce much, de Kock keeps low on the shot and pulls to deep midwicket"
10.1,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run","good length, straight, eased down to long-on"
9.6,"Kulkarni to de Kock, FOUR runs","a superb piece of invention to take him to fifty, scoops a short delivery down to fine leg, just helped it around the corner a 34-ball half-century"
9.5,"Kulkarni to de Kock, no run",swings across the line of a back-of-a-length delivery and doesn't make contact
9.5,"Kulkarni to de Kock, 1 wide","a very short slower ball, loops through to the keeper as he lets it go and gets the wide call"
9.4,"Kulkarni to Yadav, 1 run","over the wicket, back of a length at middle and off, pushed into midwicket with a straight bat"
9.3,"Kulkarni to de Kock, 1 run","this is a clubbing shot through straight midwicket, a back-of-a-length ball goes wide of long-on"
9.2,"Kulkarni to de Kock, no run","short again, clubbed to midwicket without proper timing on this occasion"
9.1,"Kulkarni to de Kock, 2 runs","over the wicket, short of a length, heaved to deep midwicket"

8.5,"Parag to Yadav, 1 run","back of a length on middle stump, whipped to wide long-on"
8.4,"Parag to de Kock, 1 run","Round the wicket, angles this in towards middle and leg. Clears the front hip and swipes it down to long-on"
8.3,"Parag to Yadav, 1 run","slower length ball on off and middle, driven gently down to long-off"
8.2,"Parag to Yadav, SIX runs","a touch slower on off stump, and he errs on the full side. Right in the slot for Suryakumar to loft back over the bowler's head"
8.1,"Parag to Yadav, no run","length ball outside off, driven to extra-cover"
7.6,"Binny to de Kock, FOUR runs","shortish, down the leg side, poor ball to bowl with fine leg inside the circle. De Kock swivels and swats it away to the left of the diving fielder"
7.5,"Binny to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length again, this time angling into middle stump. Stops on the batsman a little and he waits for it to arrive and punches to long-on"
7.4,"Binny to Yadav, 2 runs",goes wide of the crease and bowls a shortish offcutter angling in towards off stump. Pulled away to the right of long-on
7.3,"Binny to de Kock, 1 run","fuller, on the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
7.2,"Binny to de Kock, no run","oh my. That's a slower short ball, dug into the pitch, and de Kock is through the pull waaay before the ball arrives. Bounces loopily and it's on its way down when it passes over the bails"
7.1,"Binny to Yadav, 1 run","back of a length offcutter outside off, gets back and across to whip to midwicket"
6.6,"Parag to Yadav, 1 run","length ball on off stump, gets on the front foot to drive to long-off"

2.3,"Gopal to Rohit Sharma, OUT","straight back to the bowler! Bit of an odd dismissal, really. Rohit used his feet, didn't quite get to the pitch, pushed with hard hands, it was a googly, got an inside edge into his pad which looped back to Gopal"
2.2,"Gopal to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","gets the line a little wrong, angled in at leg stump, Rohit sweeps it wide of short fine leg"
2.1,"Gopal to de Kock, 1 run","over the wicket, full at leg stump, driven to long-on"
1.6,"Kulkarni to Rohit Sharma, no run","flash and a miss outside off, an appeal for caught behind from the bowler but has no support. Was short, Rohit went after it with a back-foot drive"
1.5,"Kulkarni to de Kock, 1 run","back of a length outside leg, worked into midwicket and that's a very tight single probably gone with a direct hit from Binny"
1.4,"Kulkarni to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","fuller, outside off, driven square to deep cover"

0.6,"Binny to Rohit Sharma, no run","fuller, wide outside off, he's through his drive without any timing and finds cover"
0.5,"Binny to Rohit Sharma, no run","good length outside off, driven towards the bowler who sticks his right boot out crashes into the non-striker's stumps"
0.4,"Binny to de Kock, 1 run","short of a length, tucked off the pads to deep square leg"
0.3,"Binny to de Kock, no run","big full toss! Nearly driven back to the bowler, took de Kock by surprise, pushes it straight down the pitch"
0.2,"Binny to de Kock, 2 runs","loops over midwicket! Short of a length, de Kock looks to whip it away, spoons off the splice but lands safe after the fielding at midwicket had moved in with the bowler"
0.1,"Binny to de Kock, no run","good length, straight, defended solidly back down the pitch"
19.6,"Ali to Rana, SIX runs","Rana bangs a length ball for six over long off, but RCB win the game"
19.5,"Ali to Russell, OUT","length, and he smacks this towards midwicket. There's a throw rifled in at the non-striker's end, and he's walking off. Russell is gone, as Moeen Ali whips the bails off. What a knock from Russell here, this time in a losing cause"
19.4,"Ali to Russell, no run","full ball, and he looks to go over long off, but misses. That could be the game, right there!"
19.3,"Ali to Russell, SIX runs","length, and he has hit this over long on for six!"
19.2,"Ali to Rana, 1 run","full ball, and he gets an inside edge towards long leg. Russell takes the single and refuses the second"
19.1,"Ali to Rana, no run","goes for a full ball, and Rana moves across to the off side. No wide given! Rana tries a sweep, but misses"
18.6,"Stoinis to Russell, SIX runs","yorker attempted, and he still drop-kicks this straight over the bowler, and just over long off"
18.5,"Stoinis to Russell, SIX runs","full, on off stump, and he has hammered this straight down the pitch over long off. Hits the sightscreen, as Eden Gardens rises to greet his fity off just 21 balls!"
18.4,"Stoinis to Russell, SIX runs","short ball, and he has struck this over midwicket for a huge six!"
18.3,"Stoinis to Russell, no run","short ball, and he ducks under this one. Well bowled. Russell probably thought this was going to go down the leg side, but it follows him and is a dot ball! Gold dust!"
18.2,"Stoinis to Russell, no run","full toss, outside off, and he crashes this towards cover. Moeen Ali stops this! RCB inch ever closer!"
18.2,"Stoinis to Russell, 1 wide","tries another full ball on the pads, but Russell walks across and it will be called a wide. No margin for error on the on-side"
18.1,"Stoinis to Russell, no run","full ball, and hits him on the pads. Runs all the way down towards fine leg, but he wasn't playing a shot there, so no leg byes on offer. Good ball!"
17.6,"Steyn to Rana, FOUR runs","length, and he goes inside out, and gets it over extra cover. One-bounce four"
17.5,"Steyn to Rana, no run","fuller, angles across him, and he plays outside the line of this in trying to whack it over midwicket"

17.3,"Steyn to Rana, 2 runs","length, and he has pushed this beyond Moeen Ali at short cover, and it is fielded by the sweeper cover fielder to his left. They amble through for two"
17.2,"Steyn to Rana, SIX runs","length, and he has hit this over long off. No more than a push off the front foot, on bent knee"
17.1,"Steyn to Rana, no run","length, towards off stump, and he drives this but cannot beat cover, inside the ring"
16.6,"Siraj to Rana, 1 run","length, outside off, and he has sliced this towards mid off. There's a direct hit at Russell's end as they go for the single, and he just about makes it"
16.5,"Siraj to Russell, 1 run","length, and he has hammered this off the toe-end towards long on"
16.4,"Siraj to Russell, no run","length, slower ball, outside off, and he has a swing and he can miss too! Almost fell over I think he wanted to cream this over to Dhaka!"
16.4,"Siraj to Russell, 1 wide","slower ball, but wide outside off. Russell chases it, and misses out on contact, on one knee as well. Too wide, I'm afraid!"
16.3,"Siraj to Russell, SIX runs","length, and he goes inside out. That has gone a long way over extra cover!"
16.2,"Siraj to Russell, FOUR runs","short, and he backs away and slaps this past point. What a shot again!"
16.2,"Siraj to Russell, 1 wide","short, and wide. Too wide, outside off, and Russell lets this go"
16.1,"Siraj to Rana, 1 run","length ball, that he lofts towards mid off, and they take on Steyn's arm. He has a shy at the striker's end, but misses. Russell could have been gone!"

15.5,"Saini to Rana, 1 run","length, and he has got a hold of this too, but it goes on a bounce to deep midwicket"
15.4,"Saini to Rana, SIX runs","full toss, outside off, and he has deposited this over midwicket again. Looks for a no-ball for height, but that hasn't been given"
15.3,"Saini to Rana, SIX runs","length, and he has swung this over midwicket off the back foot. What an emphatic stroke to get to fifty!"
15.2,"Saini to Rana, no run","length, moves away from him. Rana tries to make room by moving away to his leg side, and ends up needing to stretch to make contact. Misses "
15.1,"Saini to Rana, FOUR runs","length ball, and he has hit this down the wicket past long on. Really well timed by Rana"
14.6,"Chahal to Russell, SIX runs","length, on off stump, and he has clubbed this over long on. Hat-trick of sixes, and KKR are making a fist of this. Can they pull it off again?"
14.5,"Chahal to Russell, SIX runs","tossed up, and he has gone straight, and far, and wide "
14.4,"Chahal to Russell, SIX runs","length ball, and he gets the toe-end as he looks to swing this towards midwicket. It goes all the way over long on, though. Fetches this from outside off"
14.4,"Chahal to Russell, 1 wide","tossed up outside off, and outside the tramlines. Russell leaves "
14.3,"Chahal to Rana, 1 run","tossed up outside off, and he drives this towards extra cover. Steyn stops it with his boot, and gets some support from his teammate in pulling the ball back"
14.2,"Chahal to Rana, no run","length, and he looks to slog sweep, but gets an inner edge. The ball trickles down towards Chahal to his left"
14.1,"Chahal to Rana, no run","length, and he cannot get this away. Drops it back towards the bowler"
13.6,"Saini to Russell, no run","slower ball, outside off, and Russell cannot get to it. Waited for it, but it never really arrived. Sinks to his knees momentarily, as Saini completes a good over"
13.5,"Saini to Rana, 1 run","length, angles across him, and he cuts this towards backward point"
13.4,"Saini to Russell, 1 run","short, and he has top-edged this. Klaasen runs in towards his left from fine leg, and grasses this! Fast ball, and he didn't know much about where it went, looking to go over long leg, but it fell somewhere between fine leg and backward square leg"
13.3,"Saini to Russell, no run","short, moves into him, and cramps him for room. He tries to slash this away, but cannot lay bat on ball"
13.2,"Saini to Russell, FOUR runs",moves across to the leg side and slashes a length ball just outside off stump. That went like a bullet through the point region!
13.1,"Saini to Rana, 1 run","length, angles across Rana, who punches this towards backward point"
12.6,"Chahal to Russell, no run","fired wide outside off, and Russell chases it, but misses out on contact. Would have been close to being called a wide, but he gets away with this"
12.5,"Chahal to Russell, no run","wrong 'un, fired outside off, and stays within the tramlines. Russell leaves it"
12.4,"Chahal to Russell, SIX runs","tossed up outside off, and he swings this inside out it's that slashing shot of his, and it carries over extra cover. Seems to have hurt his shoulder and wrist as he struck that"
12.4,"Chahal to Russell, 1 wide","fired outisde off, and Russell lets it pass. Goes just beyond the tramlines"
12.3,"Chahal to Rana, 1 run","shorter, and quicker, and he bumps this towards backward square leg, to hand the strike back to Dre Russ"
12.2,"Chahal to Rana, FOUR runs","length, towards leg stump, and he sweeps this fine. Gets it to the left of backward square leg"
12.1,"Chahal to Russell, 1 run","length, fired outside off stump, and he rifles this towards extra cover"
11.6,"Stoinis to Rana, 2 runs","length, angles across him and he dabs it down towards third man. That looks headed for four, but Klaasen comes diving away to his right and gets his hands to it. Seems to have done enough to get rid of the ball, just before his body hits the rope. A tough one to call. He might have just done enough to save two "
11.5,"Stoinis to Uthappa, OUT","length, and he has picked this up, swung it towards backward square leg, where the catch is completed! Might have been a change of pace, scrambled seam in fact, and he ended up getting more of the edge of the bat. The intent was right, but he's been put out of his pain"
11.4,"Stoinis to Rana, 1 run","yorker, and he makes room, but can only hit it straight down the wicket towards long off"
11.3,"Stoinis to Rana, no run","length ball, slower, angles away, and he fails to make contact with an intended slog across the line"
11.2,"Stoinis to Rana, FOUR runs","length, wide outside off, and he slashes this over point. Good shot, nearly carried over the fence on the full!"
11.1,"Stoinis to Rana, 2 runs","length, outside off, and he has got the top edge as he looks to bunt this towards midwicket. It flies towards third man, and Chahal comes running in, but cannot complete the catch! Just lands short of him"
10.6,"Chahal to Uthappa, no run","fired flatter, and he gets it off his pads towards the square on the leg side. Refuses a single, and Rana has come way down the pitch. Patel's return is fired to Chahal, who cannot collect it. Reprieve for the non-striker!"
10.6,"Chahal to Uthappa, 1 wide","wide outside off, and Uthappa goes for a reverse sweep, but misses. Should have been wide anyway, though Chahal contests the decision"
10.6,"Chahal to Uthappa, 1 wide","fired wide outside off, and turns further away. Will have to rebowl this one"
10.5,"Chahal to Uthappa, no run",cuts a length ball away towards point. Has to refuse the single
10.4,"Chahal to Rana, 1 run","reverse sweep again. Set himself too early, and Chahal fired it a bit shorter, forcing him to go square towards backward point"
10.3,"Chahal to Rana, FOUR runs","tries the reverse sweep, gets the top edge, but this has flown just over short third man's head, for four!"
10.2,"Chahal to Rana, FOUR runs","short, and he swings this around towards long leg. One-bounce four for Rana!"
10.1,"Chahal to Uthappa, 1 run","length ball, and he goes back and punches it with the turn towards extra cover"
9.6,"Siraj to Rana, FOUR runs","spoils the over with a bad last ball, long hop that Rana picks up from outside off and pulls to the midwicket boundary"
9.5,"Siraj to Uthappa, 1 run",gives himself room again but Siraj keeps it outside off and Uthappa can only carve it to third man
9.4,"Siraj to Uthappa, no run","oooh, just past the outside edge. For all the flack he's got, Siraj is doing well. Brings this into Uthappa and he plays inside the line, caught on the crease a bit. The ball goes past the outside edge"
9.3,"Siraj to Uthappa, no run",goes back to being back of a length outside off and Uthappa can't connect with the steer. Good carry from that length again
9.3,"Siraj to Uthappa, 5 wide","that's a bad ball. Tried the short one again, seeing that Uthappa has dealt with the fuller one comfortably. Uthappa moved across his stumps, this one flies down leg side and wide of Parthiv too. Five wides"
9.2,"Siraj to Uthappa, no run","good comeback by Siraj, 138kph back of a length outside off and this track has bounce from that length. Uthappa stays in his crease to cut it but the ball goes over his bat"
9.1,"Siraj to Uthappa, FOUR runs","Shot. That's much better. Full on the stumps, Uthappa gives himself room and executes a textbook extra cover drive, bisects the field"
8.6,"Stoinis to Uthappa, 1 run","good length outside off, goes across and works this to backward square leg"
8.5,"Stoinis to Rana, 1 run","length ball on off, dabbed to third man"
8.4,"Stoinis to Rana, no run","full and angled across outside off, goes for the big booming drive through cover, but the ball sneaks past the outside edge."
8.3,"Stoinis to Rana, no run","good length outside off, steered to backward point"
8.2,"Stoinis to Rana, no run","slower bouncer, Rana has to innovate after setting himself up to bash through off and he tries to upper cut. Misses the ball"
8.1,"Stoinis to Rana, no run","fuller outside off, steered to gully and he sets off for a rash run. Sent back and the fielder misses the direct hit. Would have been gone if he had hit. Had almost given up trying to get back"
7.6,"Siraj to Uthappa, no run","lovely line, in the channel outside off and Uthappa is beaten on the outside edge, trying to punch the ball"
7.5,"Siraj to Uthappa, no run","fuller, punched to cover"
7.4,"Siraj to Uthappa, no run","swing and a miss. Siraj keeps this wider outside off, Uthappa is tempted into an expansive drive, but ends up missing it"
7.3,"Siraj to Uthappa, no run","pacier one, good length outside off, jabbed back to the bowler"
7.2,"Siraj to Rana, 1 run","too short and he wants to set himself up to pull it hard but mistimes it, bounces to long-on"
7.1,"Siraj to Rana, FOUR runs",lovely shot too full outside off and he stayed in his crease to punch-drive it over cover. Great timing on that one
6.6,"Stoinis to Uthappa, no run","length outside off, pushed to cover"
6.5,"Stoinis to Uthappa, no run","full on the fourth stump, pushed back to the bowler"
6.4,"Stoinis to Uthappa, no run","full outside off, he walks across and clips to mid-on"
6.3,"Stoinis to Rana, 1 run","back of a length angled across, dabs it down to third man"
6.2,"Stoinis to Uthappa, 1 run","fuller on middle and leg, flicked to deep square leg"
6.1,"Stoinis to Uthappa, no run","good length on off, gentle pace, clipped to midwicket"
5.6,"Siraj to Rana, FOUR runs","too full in the slot, and he carves it over cover to find the boundary"
5.5,"Siraj to Rana, no run",and another leave! Does Rana know the asking rate is above 10? He lets it go through outside off again
5.4,"Siraj to Rana, no run","and this one is closer to off-stump, Rana wants to steer it fine, ends up missing it"
5.3,"Siraj to Rana, no run",angled across again and Rana lets it go through again! They can't afford too many of those
5.2,"Siraj to Rana, no run",angled across him and Rana is happy to watch it go through
5.1,"Siraj to Rana, no run","good length, steered to gully"
4.6,"Steyn to Gill, OUT","Kohli almost clangs it but holds on at the second attempt Gill hasn't looked comfortable during his stay, this is a yorker length ball outside off, he wants to drive it through the offside, but ends up toe-ending it. Flies towards mid-off, and it looks like it might be going over Kohli, but he sticks out a hand over his head and grabs the ball. Not cleanly and it bounces out, but he does well with great presence of mind to hold on to it near his waist"
4.5,"Steyn to Gill, no run","doesn't give him room this time, straighter on the stumps, patted back to the bowler"
4.4,"Steyn to Gill, FOUR runs","length ball outside off and swatted past extra cover. Not exactly where he wanted to send it. He was aiming for midwicket, but was late on it, still managed to get a chunky meat of the bat behind it and the ball goes to the boundary"
4.3,"Steyn to Uthappa, 1 run","pacy one, shaping away a bit outside off, Uthappa comes on the front foot to defend, the ball takes a thick inside edge to square leg"
4.2,"Steyn to Gill, 3 runs","good length on the stumps, he moves across and clips it to deep square leg. Great timing on that, and it's racing away, but Chahal sprints after it and slides and saves the boundary, pulling the ball in just before the fence"
4.1,"Steyn to Gill, no run","full ball outside off, driven gently to mid-off"
3.6,"Saini to Gill, 1 run","slashed hard, the outside edge flies at one bounce to third man"
3.5,"Saini to Narine, OUT","and Narine's iffy stay ends with a short ball. Saini dug this in short, got it to rise up to his face. Narine with his front leg cleared, wanted to swat it towards midwicket, but he's too late on the ball and has taken his eyes off it too. Gets a top edge that loops up and settles into Parthiv's gloves"
3.4,"Saini to Narine, no run",slower ball to Narine again outside off. he's got a one-track strategy of clearing front leg and going hard - either legside or offside. Ball beats bat that time
3.3,"Saini to Gill, 1 run","mis-field by Kohli at mid-off allows one. Full outside off, driven to mid-off, Kohli fumbles"
3.2,"Saini to Gill, no run","beauty. Pacy and in the channel, beats his outside edge. Gill was feeling for it, looking to punch"
3.1,"Saini to Gill, no run","full outside off, driven from the crease but he can't beat extra cover"
2.6,"Steyn to Narine, no run","good comeback with a slower ball, length outside off. Narine wants to go hard again but too early and doesn't connect"
2.5,"Steyn to Narine, FOUR runs","slashed for four at third man, but he wasn't in control entirely. Back of a length outside off and Narine clears the front leg again has a go at it, wasn't too far from third man but hit hard enough that he had no chance - either at catching or stopping it"
2.4,"Steyn to Narine, FOUR runs","nails this one. Was expecting the short one and set himself up for it, Steyn's line was too straight, giving Narine more time to go back and connect with the pull"
2.3,"Steyn to Narine, no run",action replay of the previous ball. Back of a length angling across. Narine makes contact with only air while clearing his front leg to go hard at the ball
2.2,"Steyn to Narine, no run","and immediately Steyn shortens his length a bit. The back of length ball that is bouncing a bit has had Narine in trouble. He's stepped away to swing through extra cover again, but the ball beats bat"
2.1,"Steyn to Narine, FOUR runs","Narine connects well on this one. Follows his strategy of giving himself room and this one is a bit fuller, so he's able to punch it powerfully through cover"
1.6,"Saini to Gill, no run","back of a length outside off, Gill wants to pull but ends up mis-timing to mid-on"
1.5,"Saini to Gill, no run","back of a length outside off again, Gill - everyone who wanted him at 3 must be pleased - rises up on his toes to pat it down"
1.4,"Saini to Narine, 1 run","backing away again to give himself room and pull through the legside, but Saini follows him and Narine ends up mis-timing his pull to midwicket"
1.3,"Saini to Narine, no run","another swing and a miss. Good length again by Saina going across. Narine was stepping away to swing for the fences, misses"
1.2,"Saini to Narine, no run",shortens his length and uses his pace to get it to bounce at an uncomfortable height. Narine wants to slash but the ball bounces well above his bat
1.1,"Saini to Narine, FOUR runs","stand and deliver. Narine steps away, clears his front leg and flat-bats it powerfully straight past the bowler"
0.6,"Steyn to Lynn, OUT","Steyn has got his man this time. That seemed to come slower off the pitch, though not sure if it was a slower ball by Steyn. Lynn pushed at it too early, and pops a simple catch to mid-off. Steyn is pumped, and the comeback does have a wicket in his first over, even if a wicket off the first ball was missed"
0.5,"Steyn to Narine, 1 run","good length on the stumps, pushed to cover and they set off for a quick single. Narine has to hurry but makes it"
0.4,"Steyn to Narine, no run","angled across, well wide of the stumps but inside the tramlines. 143 kph, left alone by Narine"
0.3,"Steyn to Narine, 4 leg byes","pacy ball on the pads and Narine tickles it very fine. No fielder there, so boundary. That came off the pad actually, so it's leg-byes"
0.2,"Steyn to Narine, no run",oooh now past the left-hander's outside edge. Length ball in the channel and Narine is feeling for it
0.1,"Steyn to Lynn, 1 run",dropped by Stoinis at first slip Perfect outswinger - was Steyn ever away? (and why was he away) - and Stoinis clangs it. Flew to his right at catchable height. Steyn has a smile. Would have been the perfect comeback. Lynn had pushed at it with static feet
19.6,"Gurney to Kohli, OUT","length, and he has flicked this towards deep midwicket, where Shubman Gill comepletes the catch"
19.5,"Gurney to Kohli, FOUR runs","full toss, and he has flicked this away towards long leg. Kuldeep makes a hash of the attempted stop, and Kohli leaps in the air and takes off his helmet. Arms aloft the king is back on top of his game! He's got there in just 57 balls, and yet it hasn't been his most fluent IPL century ever, surely?"
19.4,"Gurney to Stoinis, 1 run","length, and he lofts this towards wide long off. They go for just one run. Kohli wants that century of his"
19.3,"Gurney to Stoinis, SIX runs","length, and he has picked this up, and deposited it some 12 rows back over long on!"
19.2,"Gurney to Stoinis, FOUR runs","short ball, and he swings this around to long leg, where Kuldeep Yadav makes a mess of his attempt to stop it! Overran the ball, as it spun away to his right"
19.1,"Gurney to Kohli, 1 run","full ball, outside off, and he drives this to extra cover. Won't get two that he desperately wants"
18.6,"Prasidh to Stoinis, FOUR runs","full, outisde off, and he drives this towards long off. Russell gets to it, but cannot stop it"
18.5,"Prasidh to Kohli, 1 run","full ball, on off stump, and he slaps this down towards deep midwicket"
18.4,"Prasidh to Kohli, 2 runs","short, and he whips this towards deep midwicket, and will pick up two. Takes him to 92"
18.3,"Prasidh to Kohli, FOUR runs","outside off, and an extra cover drive, on bent knee. Ah, classic Kohli!"
18.2,"Prasidh to Kohli, SIX runs","short, and he has got a hold of this. Just lofts this, stand-and-deliver, over long on. Proper slog for these death overs!"
18.1,"Prasidh to Kohli, 2 runs","short, outisde off, and he drags this towards deep midwicket. They have run hard, and made it, as the ball was thrown at the striker's end"
17.6,"Narine to Stoinis, no run","length, turns into him, tucks him up for room, and Stoinis fails to get any ball on an attempted dab towards midwicket"
17.6,"Narine to Stoinis, 1 wide","length, turns away after pitching on leg, and he will have to bowl this again"
17.5,"Narine to Stoinis, no run","length, outside off, and he cuts this to point. Too fast for them to get any runs"
17.4,"Narine to Kohli, 1 run","length, outside off, and he goes back and cuts this towards deep extra cover"
17.3,"Narine to Kohli, SIX runs","short, and he has lofted this off the back foot towards wide long on. Terrific bit of timing there!"
17.2,"Narine to Stoinis, 1 run","length, comes back into him, and he punches this towards long on"
17.1,"Narine to Kohli, 1 run","short ball, and he biffs this towards deep midwicket"
16.6,"Gurney to Kohli, 1 run","full ball, outside off, and he squeezes this away towards point"
16.5,"Gurney to Kohli, SIX runs","length, and he smacks this straight back past Gurney. Doesn't bother keeping this down, and it's a pretty big six!"
16.4,"Gurney to Kohli, FOUR runs","angles across him, and he crunches a square drive past point. Terrific shot, as Gurney had reverted to over the wicket for that ball"
16.3,"Gurney to Kohli, 2 runs","short ball, outside off, and he hits it hard towards extra cover. Calls for two, and gets it in the end"
16.2,"Gurney to Kohli, FOUR runs","slower ball, but too close to leg stump, and Kohli waits on it, moves a bit inside the line, and whips this away towards long leg"
16.1,"Gurney to Stoinis, 1 run","slower ball, short, and he goes up on his toes and punches this to point"
16.1,"Gurney to Stoinis, 1 wide","slower ball, back of the hand, but starts way down the leg side. Will have to bowl this again"
15.6,"Kuldeep to Ali, OUT","it has worked! Slides a slower ball, tossed up invitingly, across him, and Moeen takes the bait and goes for another big hit, but gets the top edge. It's Prasidh Krishna who grabs on, and Kolkata get a big break. What a knock from Moeen Ali, though!"
15.5,"Kuldeep to Ali, SIX runs","length, and slaps this over long off, for another six!"
15.5,"Kuldeep to Ali, 1 wide","dropped short, and wide. Turns away, and he will have to rebowl this one"
15.4,"Kuldeep to Ali, SIX runs","length, and he whips this over long on, for six! The fielder there, Prasidh Krishna, was a few steps in, and saw this sail over his head. Could have caught it had he been by the boundary ropes"
15.3,"Kuldeep to Ali, FOUR runs","slogs a fuller ball outside off, down towards long on. One bounce and four. What clean strking from Moeen Ali!"
15.2,"Kuldeep to Ali, SIX runs","moves across to get close to a ball outside off, and slog-sweeps this for six. Fifty for Moeen!"
15.1,"Kuldeep to Ali, FOUR runs","flighted, outside off, and Moeen stretches and drives this gracefully through covers. Gets it wide enough to beat Dre Russ at the long off fence"

14.5,"Prasidh to Ali, FOUR runs","short, and Moeen looks to flick this. Takes the top edge and flies over Karthik through to third man for four"

14.3,"Prasidh to Kohli, FOUR runs","short, and he has looked to go through the onside with a whip. Takes the top edge, and flies over short third man, and goes through one-bounce for four. Lucky Kohli!"
14.2,"Prasidh to Ali, 1 leg bye","length ball, jags back into him with the angle, and he fails to make contact with an attempted drive towards midwicket. Goes off the pads towards third man"
14.1,"Prasidh to Kohli, 1 run","length ball, and he punches it down to mid off. Takes on Andre Russell's arm, and gets there to the non-striker's end. Soaks up the generous applause from the Eden Gardens"
13.6,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 1 run","tosses this up around off and middle, and Kohli punches this down to long off"
13.5,"Kuldeep to Ali, 1 run","length, that he lofts inside out, and it drops to Russell on one bounce at long off"
13.4,"Kuldeep to Ali, no run","flights this outside off, and it turns away. Moeen leaves this, but it is within the tramlines"

13.2,"Kuldeep to Ali, FOUR runs","length ball, flatter, and he goes back and guides this between point and short third man. Uses the pace of the ball to send it to the fence"
13.1,"Kuldeep to Ali, SIX runs","flighted, outside off, and he slog-sweeps this over midwicket. Good shot, because he was taking on one of the bigger boundaries at the Eden Gardens"
12.6,"Narine to Ali, 1 run","length ball, that he works around the corner towards short fine leg"
12.5,"Narine to Ali, FOUR runs","inside edge, off a length ball on the stumps. He was looking to smash this through midwicket, and it runs away to the fine leg fence"

11.4,"Chawla to Ali, 1 run","wrong 'un again, down the leg side, and he swings this around to the long leg region"
11.3,"Chawla to Ali, SIX runs","length ball, and he has slog-swept this, into the stands over midwicket. May have been the wrong 'un again, but bowled it too close to Ali's arc"
11.2,"Chawla to Ali, no run","wrong 'un, goes past the outside edge as it slants across Moeen Ali, and also misses the off stump by a whisker"
11.1,"Chawla to Kohli, 1 run","wide of the crease, full ball on off stump, and he hammers it down towards long on"
10.6,"Russell to Ali, no run","length, outside off, and he has a waft at that, but misses. Couldn't have been too far from the alleys denoting a wide, but good enough to pass through"
10.5,"Russell to Kohli, 1 run","steps down the wicket and turns a length ball into a half-volley, flicking it away towards deep midwicket. Picks up one, and wants two but has to turn it down"
10.4,"Russell to Kohli, SIX runs","short, and he swings this around towards long leg. Doesn't bother to roll his wrists, and doesn't need to!"
10.3,"Russell to Kohli, no run","fuller ball, and he drives it back, and Russell dives away to his left and stops it. Has a shy at the stumps as well, and Kohli had to scamper back home. Excellent stuff!"

9.1,"Kuldeep to Ali, SIX runs","Moeen shows RCB what they missed by pushing him to 4 down the track and to the pitch of the ball, lifts this over long-on. Gets enough to beat the man's jump there"
8.6,"Russell to Ali, 1 run","back of a length on the stumps, tucked to square leg off the back foot"
8.5,"Russell to Nath, OUT","that is that. The Nath experiment hasn't worked at all. Nath skies it in the air off a leading edge, trying to pick it up off his legs, it goes straight up in the silly point region. Russell seems to be settling under it but Uthappa is charging in from short cover too and snaffles it right from under Russell's nose almost. Luckily no collision with Uthappa showing some nimble footwork. Smiles all around from KKR"
8.4,"Russell to Nath, no run","good pace, sharp bouncer and Nath was very late on it, trying to pull. Whistles past his helmet"
8.3,"Russell to Kohli, 1 run","slower ball outside off, Kohli clips it to long-on. Didn't read it and didn't time it well"
8.2,"Russell to Kohli, no run","back of a length outside off, Kohli goes to slash it hard, connects only with air. Ball bounced over his bat"
8.1,"Russell to Nath, 1 run","back of a length outside off, punched with force but there is deep cover"
7.6,"Kuldeep to Nath, 1 run",conventional sweep this time and deep square leg tidies up
7.5,"Kuldeep to Nath, no run","tossed up on leg and Nath reverse sweeps, but doesn't time it well. Short third man fields"
7.4,"Kuldeep to Kohli, 1 run","tossed up leg and middle, Kohli sweeps - a shot he doesn't play all that often - to deep square leg"
7.3,"Kuldeep to Kohli, FOUR runs","bullet tossed up too much, ends up as a half volley outside off and Kohli drills it so hard that deep extra cover can't get to it despite the ball not being too far"
7.2,"Kuldeep to Kohli, no run",punched back again but Kuldeep fields
7.1,"Kuldeep to Kohli, FOUR runs","beautiful shot Kuldeep tosses the first ball up, Kohli is down the track and drives him straight back and finds the fence"
6.6,"Russell to Nath, no run",well bowled. Saw him come down the track and bends his back to bowl a bouncer. Nath ends up trying to upper cut it but misses
6.5,"Russell to Kohli, 1 run","digs it in short and Kohli goes for the pull but gets a top edge. One bounce to fine leg, with Prasidh doing well to move to his right quickly and field the ball"
6.4,"Russell to Kohli, no run","fuller, in driving range and Kohli goes at it hard ,but straight to short cover"
6.3,"Russell to Kohli, 2 runs","back of a lenth and gets it to bounce a bit, but Kohli rides the bounce while slashing it to short third man's left, where Rana puts in a dive but can only get a hand to the ball"
6.2,"Russell to Nath, 1 run","back of a length outside off, Nath stays beside the ball and punches to deep cover off the back foot"
6.1,"Russell to Kohli, 1 run","good length, stump to stump, Kohli gets it high on the bat while pushing towards cover"
5.6,"Prasidh to Kohli, 1 run","good length, driven to cover"
5.5,"Prasidh to Kohli, FOUR runs",outside edge goes for four. Prasidh's not having any luck. Gets Kohli's leading edge. Good length on off and Kohli was looking to flick it across but gets a thick edge. No slip and he gets a four for it
5.4,"Prasidh to Kohli, no run","back of a length, coming in from off, raps Kohli on the pads. Too late on the flick"
5.3,"Prasidh to Nath, 1 run","better length, in the channel, draws the drive but he gets a thick edge that goes to third man"
5.2,"Prasidh to Nath, SIX runs",fetch that back of a length and Nath unleashes a fierce pull off the back foot that carries all the way over the midwicket boundary
5.1,"Prasidh to Nath, no run","oh that's another loud appeal, but no reviews left for KKR. Nips in from a length outside off and hits Nath on the knee roll. Looked closer than the one they lost their review for (against Kohli)."
4.6,"Gurney to Kohli, no run","oooh, lovely line. In the channel outside off and on a length. This one doesn't nip back in and Kohli ends up feeling for it, but it beats his outside edge"
4.5,"Gurney to Nath, 1 run","slower ball, nipping in from around off, Nath waits for it and flicks it to short fine leg's right"
4.5,"Gurney to Nath, 1 wide","loses his line a bit and way down leg, he'll have to re-bowl that one"
4.4,"Gurney to Kohli, 1 run","down the track and looking to go straight over the top, but Gurney saw him coming and shortened his length, Kohli ends up inside edging to square leg"
4.3,"Gurney to Nath, 1 run","fuller on the stumps, Nath goes a bit across and flicks it to short fine leg"
4.2,"Gurney to Nath, no run","good length on off, coming back in sharply. Nath wants to tuck it to the onside but it hits his pad and rolls towards the bowler"

3.6,"Narine to Kohli, 2 runs",angled into the pads and flicked to deep square leg

3.4,"Narine to Kohli, 1 run","good length, tapped to long-on"
3.3,"Narine to Kohli, FOUR runs","misfield by Gill at deep midwicket allows four too short and Kohli rocks back to pull powerfully. It was straight to Gill who lets it through his hands. Didn't bend down enough, poor effort"
3.2,"Narine to Patel, OUT","juggled and caught by deep square leg. Tossed up a bit, and it dipped on Parthiv, who wanted to go for the legside swipe. Only gets a toe-end that sends the ball swirling into the air. Rana runs to his right from deep square leg and holds on after juggling it a bit."
3.1,"Narine to Kohli, 1 run",worked off his pads to midwicket
2.6,"Prasidh to Patel, FOUR runs","shot Parthiv is expecting the short of length stuff and he gets into position to essay the slash over point perfectly, times it well and sends it to the fence. 10 runs off the over, which is unfair refleciton on Prasidh's bowling"
2.5,"Prasidh to Kohli, 1 run",another short ball that rises up to Kohli's throat. Hurried him though Kohli connected with the pull better than Parthiv has. Didn't try to hit too hard and didn't time it perfectly. Deep midwicket is there to collect
2.4,"Prasidh to Patel, 1 run",stays legside of the ball this time and slashes it to third man. Good length angling across him and bouncing near the ribs again
2.3,"Prasidh to Patel, no run","beaten on the pull again. Rises up to the rib cage, and hits Parthiv before rolling to slip. He tried to pull it again"
2.2,"Prasidh to Patel, no run","quick one at 143.3 kph, gets it to bounce up a bit extra off a length and hits Parthiv on the thigh, beaten on the pull"
2.1,"Prasidh to Patel, FOUR runs","yorker first up, terrific ball and unfortunately for him, Parthiv gets an inside edge that runs down to fine leg"
1.6,"Narine to Kohli, no run","getting some turn is Narine, but the line is a bit off. Pitches on middle and turns to leg, tucked off his pads in the square leg region"
1.5,"Narine to Patel, 1 run","another quicker one, but Parthiv saw that. Rocked back to pull forcefully, but there is a deep midwicket"
1.4,"Narine to Patel, no run","hurried on to him a bit off a length, Parthiv stays in his crease and defends off the back foot."
1.3,"Narine to Kohli, 1 run","too full on the pads, flicked to deep midwicket"
1.2,"Narine to Kohli, no run","big shout not given, and KKR have gone for a review That looked mighty close,  pitched on a length and was turning into Kohli, who played down the wrong line and is struck on the pads. But did it turn too much? No edge, so we'll have to wait for ball tracking. And the umpire is right, it was turning too much. It's missing leg, so KKR have lost their review"
1.1,"Narine to Kohli, 2 runs","fullish around off, comes forward and works it to midwicket. Quick running gives them two"
0.6,"Gurney to Patel, no run","back of a length angling into him, misses the flick, the ball rolls off the pad"
0.5,"Gurney to Kohli, 1 run","back of a length, Kohli walks across and flicks to deep midwicket"
0.4,"Gurney to Kohli, no run","good length on off, clipped to the bowler's right"
0.3,"Gurney to Kohli, no run","oooh, gets an outside edge first ball. Another slower one, and that is what has saved Kohli with the ball dropping in front of slip"
0.2,"Gurney to Patel, 1 run","good length on the stumps, flicked to deep square leg"
0.2,"Gurney to Patel, 1 wide","hits a length and goes down leg with Parthiv walking across the stumps to tuck it fine. Misses it, but it'll be wide"
0.1,"Gurney to Patel, no run","oh, slower ball first up. Rolled his fingers over it and Parthiv was coming forward to push, gets it very high on the bat. It pops towards cover, but no fielder"
19.6,"Pandya to Mishra, 1 run","short, and he biffs this away towards midwicket"
19.5,"Pandya to Mishra, 2 runs","length ball, and he backs away and slashes this towards backward point. Not sure he intended for the ball to go there, but the edge carries it finer than what he may have planned"
19.4,"Pandya to Rabada, OUT","length, wide of off stump, and he has looked to go inside out, and this time Pollard takes the catch running away to his right"
19.3,"Pandya to Rabada, no run","fuller, straighter, and he misses out on an attempted forcing shot through the off side"
19.2,"Pandya to Rabada, SIX runs","slower ball again, and this time he latches on to it and smashes this over midwicket. Big six!"
19.1,"Pandya to Rabada, no run","slower ball, cuts across him, as Rabada loads up for a big heave on the onside, but misses"
18.6,"Malinga to Rabada, 1 run","slower, outside off, and he looks to loft this towards long on. Pollard runs in, gets to it, and drops it! Wow second drop in the last two games, isn't it? From Pollard?"
18.5,"Malinga to Mishra, 1 run","slower ball, outside off, and he looks to drive this. Seems to get a bit of an outside edge, as it runs towards de Kock, but lands ahead of the keeper. They are able to pick up one"
18.5,"Malinga to Mishra, 1 wide","looks for the yorker, but overcooks it. Will be called a wide, as it goes down the leg side again"
18.4,"Malinga to Mishra, 4 leg byes","full ball, and he looks to get a leg glance going. Takes the pad and runs down to fine leg"
18.3,"Malinga to Rabada, 1 run","length, and he drives this towards the sweeper cover fielder"
18.2,"Malinga to Mishra, 1 run","fuller, slower, and he guides this towards square leg. There's a shy at the stumps at the non-striker's end, but the fielder misses out on the direct hit"

17.6,"Bumrah to Mishra, no run",advances down the track and slogs a length ball towards mid off

17.3,"Bumrah to Mishra, 1 run","fast, length ball outside off, and he guides this towards third man"
17.2,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, OUT","BOWLED! Fast, full and accurate. Axar backs away looking to get this over the off side, and the ball goes through the gate and rattles his middle stump. BOOMRAH is in the house!"
17.1,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, OUT","fast, straight, and he defends this. Paul has come halfway down the track at the other end, and Bumrah gets to the ball, and throws the stumps down at the non-striker's end. Paul was still halfway down the pitch! Hard to say if there was a single there or not, but Paul was definitely not communicating well enough"
16.6,"Malinga to Morris, OUT","full, and he has swung this towards long on, where Hardik comes forward and takes a good, low catch. This was a useful resistance from Morris and Axar, but he had no option but to go for it, with the run rate required catching up to 21"
16.5,"Malinga to Axar Patel, 1 run","yorker, and he digs it out towards cover"
16.4,"Malinga to Axar Patel, 2 runs","full ball, and he digs it out between his leg. The Natmeg again, but this time towards short midwicket. Can only get a couple here"
16.3,"Malinga to Morris, 1 run","slower, fuller ball on off, and he digs it out towards short midwicket. Smart bowling"
16.2,"Malinga to Axar Patel, 1 run","moves away, and picks up a slower, fuller ball and drives it towards cover"
16.1,"Malinga to Axar Patel, SIX runs","slower ball, and he has got a hold of this! Swings it away, picking it up from outside off, and through midwicket for a big six!"
15.6,"Bumrah to Morris, no run","looks for the yorker, and Morris takes it on the full, but his forced drive cannot beat cover"
15.5,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, 1 run","length ball, angles away from him, and takes the outside edge as Axar shapes to defend. Runs down towards third man. Good pace on that ball, and a hint of reverse swing too on a scruffy surface"
15.4,"Bumrah to Morris, 1 run","short, and he gets a hold of this, but there's a fielder at deep midwicket, where he swings this ball around"
15.3,"Bumrah to Morris, 2 runs","yorker, and he digs this out and gets it towards deep midwicket. They press hard for the second, and Axar Patel just about makes it at the non-striker's end. Was a sharp throw from Hardik Pandya"
15.2,"Bumrah to Morris, no run","short ball, a bit slower too, and Morris looks to drive this through covers, but the ball never really arrives. Bounces a couple of times on the way to de Kock"

14.3,"Malinga to Axar Patel, 1 run","full, wide, and he guides this down to third man"

14.1,"Malinga to Axar Patel, no run","slower ball, on off stump, and he mistimes a cut towards short cover, right where Rohit Sharma has stationed himself"
13.6,"Bumrah to Morris, no run","fast, outside off, and keeps a bit low as it beats Morris' outside edge"
13.5,"Bumrah to Pant, OUT","THAT COULD BE THE GAME! The move to bring back Bumrah pays off, as he gets a length ball to nip back just a bit off the seam. Pant looks for the heave-ho down the ground, but misses the line of it. It comes in a touch and knocks his off stump out of the ground. Bumrah lets out an exultant roar. Mumbai Indians are flying at the moment, through their balanced bowling attack"
13.4,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, 1 run","length ball, on off, and he pushes this towards cover"
13.3,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, 2 runs","short, angles across him, and he guides this down towards third man. Gets it wide enough to pick up a couple"

Think he missed it, but Sunrisers have gone for the review. Replays confirm there was no bat involved, the ball brushed the back thigh on its way into Bairstow's gloves. But third umpire has to now check for lbw as well. It's umpire's call on the impact, just around off stump and umpire's call on the stumps as well, would have just clipped the off stick.

13.4,"Rashid Khan to Jadhav, OUT","another googly and Rashid has another lbw. Jadhav has reviewed it. Length ball outside off, Jadhav comes forward and looks to play around his pad, misses and his struck in front of the middle. Replays show it would have gone on to clip the top of leg.

10.2,"Shankar to du Plessis, OUT","and extra bounce does the trick. Short of length outside off, scrambled seam. Du Plessis looked to give himself some room by backing away, skipped down as well and went for the cut but not enough room, Bairstow pouches the outside edge"

18.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Rahane, OUT","more offcutters and this one is taken by short third man running nearly all the way to the boundary! Brilliant stuff from Arshdeep to trust his slower balls. To line them up well outside off, meaning Rahane's helpless flail into the leg side, takes a clean top edge. And even better catching from Shami, his eyes always on the ball."
18.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Rahane, 2 runs","steps out of his crease to smear a wide delivery outside off to deep cover. This is good stuff from Arshdeep, not giving up the easy leg-side boundary that batsman crave in this stage of the innings"

17.4,"Shami to Binny, SIX runs","scoops it outta here! He gets inside the line of a short ball angled into him and with that angle he just helps the ball away. Sensible, sensational batting"
17.3,"Shami to Binny, FOUR runs","launches the short ball outside off to the square leg boundary, bisecting the two men in the deep. That's brilliant hitting"
17.2,"Shami to Rahane, 1 run",backs away and pulls the short ball on leg stump to deep square leg
17.1,"Shami to Archer, OUT","taken at long-on! Archer biffs a short ball outside off with great power, but these are long boundaries and that's a top fielder. KL Rahul comes in off the boundary and takes it ever so confidently. Royals need 50 off 17 now"
16.6,"Ashwin to Archer, 1 run",punches the flatter delivery outside off through the covers
16.5,"Ashwin to Archer, no run","the pitch is too slow. New batsmen can't come in and go bang bang. Not even Archer, who goes for a big hit and ends up chopping it back to the bowler"
16.4,"Ashwin to Rahane, 1 run","shortish and outside off, he cuts to the sweeper"
16.3,"Ashwin to Turner, OUT","duck on IPL debut! This, strangely enough, is a slow, tossed up legbreak, possibly because Ashwin thinks he can bait the big hitter into a false shot. And bait him he does. The equation makes Turner go for it. The turn on the ball makes the shot go to long-off when he is looking to go dead straight. Miller runs in and takes the catch and Royals are in a mess again"
16.3,"Ashwin to Turner, 1 wide","spears the legbreak well wide of off stump, hoping to keep away from Turner's hitting arc"
16.2,"Ashwin to Rahane, 1 run",gets down low and pulls the short ball on leg stump to deep square leg
16.1,"Ashwin to Rahane, 2 runs","mis-hit, catching chance, but it falls short of long-off racing in off the boundary! Ashwin hits the deck with a very fast legbreak and the pitch responds by giving the ball extra fizz, making it bounce awkwardly on Rahane, who skews a pull shot down the ground"
15.6,"Ashwin to Tripathi, OUT","taken at long-off. The run-rate kept rising. He had to do something about it. He sees a short ball outside off, goes for the lofted drive, but the ball seems to come off the higher part of the bat and so doesn't have the timing to clear the fence"
15.5,"Ashwin to Rahane, 1 run","short and wide outside off, Rahane cuts to deep point"
15.4,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run","more carroms, Tripathi swings it out to deep midwicket to get his fifty. Mild applause from his team-mates but there's no celebration from him"
15.3,"Ashwin to Tripathi, no run","carrom ball, outside off, Tripathi flat-bats it back at the bowler"
15.3,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 wide","stumps him?. Ashwin sees Tripathi haring down the pitch and slides the ball so beautiful wide outside the off stump. The batsman swings in complete desperation, misses it altogether, but replays show he does have the agility to shove his bat inside the crease before Pooran could break the stumps. The wicketkeeper had a huge distance to cover, collecting the ball and breaking the stumps"
15.2,"Ashwin to Rahane, 1 run",comes down the track to lift the length ball on leg stump down to long-on
15.1,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run",mis-hits a flatter delivery outside off to long-on
14.6,"Ashwin to Rahane, 2 runs",walks down and sweeps the length ball on off stump away to deep midwicket
14.5,"Ashwin to Rahane, no run","panics against the short ball on middle and leg, going for the pull shot, but it comes to him well after he plays the shot, beating him completely"
14.4,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run","plenty of width to free the arms, but Tripathi can't beat the field, Ashwin's placed a deep extra cover there and the ball finds him perfectly"
14.3,"Ashwin to Rahane, 1 run",waits on the back foot and taps the flatter delivery to short third man
14.2,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run","shortish and outside off, Tripathi sets up for the pull, but it's the long boundary there, and he can only find midwicket"
14.1,"Ashwin to Tripathi, no run","quicker through the air and angled into leg stump. But he makes every effort to turn the ball and turn it he does. As a result, Tripathi is badly squared up while he defends the ball"
13.6,"Mandeep to Rahane, 2 runs",lifts the length ball outside off over extra cover. Only eight runs off the part-timer. That's a huge plus for Kings XI. That's the timeout
13.5,"Mandeep to Tripathi, 1 run",slices a length ball on off stump to the sweeper
13.4,"Mandeep to Rahane, 1 run","slower, length ball, and it keeps low too. Rahane tries to flick through midwicket but finds the ball popping up in the air and going way too straight"
13.3,"Mandeep to Rahane, 2 runs",lifts a length ball on off stump over Mandeep's head and top-class running gets them two
13.2,"Mandeep to Tripathi, 1 run","short and wide, Tripathi lashes it to deep point"
13.1,"Mandeep to Rahane, 1 run","hammers it back down the pitch, but Mandeep saves his own blushes by diving full length to his right and stopping a few crucial runs"
12.6,"Shami to Rahane, 1 run","a little bit of width on offer and Rahane makes full use of it, dabbing the ball to third man"
12.5,"Shami to Tripathi, 1 run",hacks a short ball outside off to long-on
12.4,"Shami to Tripathi, no run","shortish and outside off, steers it behind point"
12.3,"Shami to Tripathi, FOUR runs",yorker goes badly wrong and Tripathi is perfectly poised to take advantage. Holds his shape as the ball lands just in front of his boots and then helps it on its way to the fine leg boundary.
12.2,"Shami to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length and outside off, Rahane dabs it to third man"
12.1,"Shami to Rahane, FOUR runs","unreal timing. Rahane has no trouble ticking the ball away so long as it has pace on it and Shami provides plenty, right on his pads, and the Royals captain flicks it to the right of deep square leg"
11.6,"Ashwin to Tripathi, no run","slices the shortish delivery turning into him to backward point. Kings XI pulling things back. Last two overs, only nine runs, and a big wicket"
11.5,"Ashwin to Rahane, 1 run","another carrom ball, which Rahane nudges towards long-on"
11.4,"Ashwin to Samson, OUT","plays all over it. Ashwin has seen Samson sweeping on length regardless of the spin on the ball. So he puts this around off stump - a region that is conducive to the sweep shot - but the length of this ball is a little fuller. And the ball skids through off the pitch, going under the bat and taking down off stump. The subtlest of variations. The greatest of effects."
11.3,"Ashwin to Samson, 2 runs","another carrom ball, angled into the right-hander, Samson though dinks it into the midwicket region gently, knowing full well that with the man back in the crease, he has runs on offer"
11.2,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run",taps it down the ground to long-on
11.1,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","carrom ball from wide of the crease. But Samson doesn't care for that, sweeping the ball on length and just trusting his timing"
10.6,"Ashwin to Tripathi, no run","nicely tossed up on off stump, Tripathi smashes it to cover. Only four off the over"
10.5,"Ashwin to Tripathi, no run","top stuff from Ashwin, diving to his right and saving a hard-hit drive down the ground"
10.4,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","strays on the pads and since it's a length ball as well, Samson gets down low to sweep. Finds deep square leg though"
10.3,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run","bowls slow, which is why even his short balls can't be timed properly. Tripathi is actually into his pull shot too early and ends up mis-hitting to deep midwicket"
10.2,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","quicker and shorter to Samson, who reads it all very well and late cuts the ball outside off to short third man."
10.1,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run","good bowling - tossing it up and getting it to dip sharply on the right-hander. So much that Tripathi, and his big backlift, decide to just block it through the covers"
9.6,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run",whips this shortish delivery down to long-on
9.5,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","draws the edge with this carrom ball on off, rolls wide of short third man"
9.4,"Ashwin to Samson, no run","straighter one, pushed straight to cover"
9.3,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run","floated full on off, gentle dab into the gap between cover and point"
9.2,"Ashwin to Tripathi, no run","carrom ball, the length is on the shorter side, dabbed straight to short third man"
9.1,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run",turns this towards short midwicket for an easy single
8.6,"Shami to Tripathi, no run","slants one back in from wide of the crease, defended back"
8.5,"Shami to Samson, 1 run",another bunt down to third man
8.4,"Shami to Samson, FOUR runs","dabbed away late to the third man boundary. Played so very late, excellent control. Samson's on top of his game here"
8.3,"Shami to Samson, FOUR runs","slips one down leg and Samson flicks this fine to beat M Ashwin at fine leg. Shami bowled that at 144.6, all Samson needed really was a deflection"
8.2,"Shami to Tripathi, 1 run","slower length ball outside off, steered to square third man"
8.1,"Shami to Tripathi, 2 runs",punches this length delivery into the gap at deep cover
7.6,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 3 runs","flayed away to deep cover where Mujeeb has hurt himself trying to dive, ends up parrying the ball further away. Mujeeb is down on the floor, clutching his shoulder."
7.5,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run",works this from outside off towards deep midwicket
7.4,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run",works this down to deep midwicket
7.3,"Ashwin to Samson, 3 runs","superb execution! Gets outside the line and paddles this fine. Better work from Shami, first to give it chase and then pull the ball back in, all to save a solitary run"
7.2,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run","lands this on a length outside off, punches to long-on"
7.1,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run",works this with the spin to deep midwicket
6.6,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","gentle dab to short third man again, quick single taken"
6.5,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run",too short and he slaps this to deep cover
6.4,"Ashwin to Tripathi, FOUR runs","delicate little glide past the diving Arshdeep at short third man. Played it really, really late"
6.3,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run",whips this to deep square
6.2,"Ashwin to Tripathi, 1 run","shortish on middle, pulled to deep midwicket"
6.1,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run",punches this shortish delivery to long-off
5.6,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, no run",pushed into the covers
5.5,"Mujeeb to Samson, 1 run",works this down to long-on as he jogs the single
5.4,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, 1 run",chipped down to Rahul at long-on
5.3,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, no run","skiddy length ball from wide of the crease, Tripathi right behind the line in defence"
5.2,"Mujeeb to Samson, 1 run",punched down to long-on
5.1,"Mujeeb to Samson, no run","straightens after drifting in a touch, Samson gets a leading edge that rolls to cover point"
4.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, FOUR runs",Shami makes a right royal mess at short third man! Sliced to him on the bounce and he lets it through to concede a four.
4.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, 2 runs","off-cutter which he squeezes past point, aggressive running to come back for the second"
4.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, FOUR runs",leans into the drive and slices it up and over to the square third man boundary. Too much width
4.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Samson, 1 run",slower delivery that he bunts to cover for a quick single
4.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Samson, 1 wide","walks across but Arshdeep sprays this further away to negate this, left alone. Wide called"
4.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, 1 run",short-arm jab to deep midwicket
4.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Buttler, OUT","huge scalp for the young man, but credit for it goes entirely to Nicholas Pooran, who takes an excellent catch! Buttler looks to wallop this length ball across the line, gets a leading edge that swirls in the air for a long, long time. Pooran turned around and ran back and settled himself under the swirler before pouching it safe. Ashwin rips out a roar, we won't see Ashwin v Buttler tonight."
3.6,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 1 run",driven wide of cover
3.6,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 3 wide","slips this down leg, Buttler attempts a fine paddle. Can't get bat, keeper fumbles too, more runs"
3.5,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, 1 run","another skiddy delivery, half-pull to long-on"
3.5,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 2 wide","slides this down leg, keeper fumbles and they run a bye too"
3.4,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 2 runs",steps out and squeezes this off a thick inside edge to long-on
3.3,"Mujeeb to Buttler, no run","leading edge, rolls to cover."
3.2,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, 1 run","swung across the line, one bounce to long-on"
3.1,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, no run","driven to cover, straight to Mandeep"
2.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Buttler, no run",beauty! Beats the edge with one that zips across with Buttler looking to steer behind square.
2.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Buttler, 1 wide",slower delivery but sprays this too far wide outside off
2.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Buttler, no run","stops on him just a touch, Buttler gets a thick inside edge to midwicket"
2.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Buttler, FOUR runs",scorcher! Too much width and he reaches out to open the bat face ever-so-slightly to play this delightful square drive.
2.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, 1 run","slants one full, Tripathi gets a thick inside edge on the drive to midwicket"
2.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Buttler, 1 run",walks across and bunts this to mid-off
2.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Buttler, SIX runs","welcome to the IPL, young man says Buttler. Sashays down the pitch and whips him over midwicket. That sailed over"
1.6,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, 2 runs","shortish on middle and leg, punched down to wide long-on"
1.5,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, 2 runs","works this from outside off towards wide long-on, excellent running"
1.4,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 1 run","drifts one in from wide of the crease, worked towards deep midwicket"
1.3,"Mujeeb to Buttler, SIX runs","steps out and wallops this over long-on, into the top tier. Super hit."
1.2,"Mujeeb to Buttler, no run","punched straight to cover, good bowling"
1.1,"Mujeeb to Buttler, no run","floated full on the stumps, defended back"
0.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Buttler, 1 run","excellent stop by Mandeep at mid-off! Buttler reached out to drive, didn't time it well but it still needed some stopping. The young man bowls an excellent first over"
0.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, 1 leg bye","hustles him with some late inswing, Tripathi is thrown off balance as he looks to nudge this, the ball deflects off the pad to short fine."
0.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Buttler, 1 run",stands tall and bunts it to mid-off for a quick single
0.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Buttler, no run","wow, Arshdeep seems to have put in some yards of pace. Length ball at 137.7kph - he didn't average more than 130 at the U-19 World Cup last year - defended back"
0.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Buttler, no run","rooted to the crease, hangs his bat out at a full delivery, beaten."
0.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, 1 run","slants a length ball across, steered to square third man"
19.6,"Kulkarni to Ashwin, SIX runs","scoops it! That's the way to end a T20 innings. And he sure enjoyed it, striding over to his partner and punches his gloves with extra oomph. This shows Ashwin in his best light - he knows the bowler is under pressure having bowled a short ball. He knows he's bound to go for the yorker and so he sets up for the scoop shot, backing himself to get under the ball, and easily does so when it ends up a full toss outside off. Then a little bit of wristwork makes sure it travels all the way"
19.5,"Kulkarni to Ashwin, SIX runs","launches it over midwicket. Ashwin picks the slower ball, waits for it to hit the deck and come within his hitting arc and then pulls it with some power"
19.4,"Kulkarni to Mujeeb, 1 leg bye","nails the yorker, angling into Mujeeb's toes and try as he might he can't get any bat to it. They do sneak a leg bye to point though"
19.3,"Kulkarni to Ashwin, 1 run",steps down the track and nails the back of a length ball on off stump to the left of mid-off. Buttler does well to stop it going to the boundary with quick movement and a well timed dive
19.2,"Kulkarni to Ashwin, FOUR runs",carves the short ball outside off behind point and keeps it well to the right of third man to find a well contrived boundary
19.1,"Kulkarni to Miller, OUT","another slower ball, another wicket. Miller tries to cream it over wide long-on, making room and swinging as hard as he can. But since Kulkarni pulls all the pace off it, the batsman can't really get all the timing he wants on it and Buttler picks up an easy catch at long-on"
18.6,"Archer to Mandeep, OUT","drags on! Archer comes down from 150 clicks to a mere 111 and it bamboozles Mandeep. Comes out the back of the hand, concentrates on pitching it short - which is because the batsman's mind reads the length instinctively but doesn't always catch the pace  - Mandeep is into the pull way too early and the ball ricochets off his bat into the base of the stumps. Top class bowling from a top class talent. Ed Smith, are you watching? (He and the other England selectors pick their World Cup squad tomorrow)"
18.5,"Archer to Mandeep, no run","148 kph full toss on middle, Mandeep can only bunt it back to the bowler"
18.4,"Archer to Miller, 1 run","low full toss on leg stump, Miller taps it to long-on"
18.3,"Archer to Pooran, OUT",taken at cover. Archer's so good he's getting wickets off full tosses. Pooran tries to drag it from outside off into the leg side but the rapid pace on the ball means it skews off the outside top half of the half and ends up in Rahane's hands
18.2,"Archer to Pooran, 2 runs","doesn't quite land the yorker, but when you're pace is at 145 kph, it is still hard to power away. Pooran clears his front leg and swings it to long-on"
18.1,"Archer to Pooran, no run",mis-hits a near-yorker at 145 kph to mid-off
17.6,"Unadkat to Miller, FOUR runs",launches it to the extra cover boundary! Minor blip in planning from Unadkat as he goes normal pace and lands it right in the slot for Miller to lash past mid-off's right
17.5,"Unadkat to Pooran, 1 leg bye","beats him with his lack of pace - it's only 108 kph - and it offers no hitting room. Pooran, even after clearing the front leg, isn't able to get bat to it, playing a flick shot and instead finding runs at third man"
17.4,"Unadkat to Miller, 1 run","another slower short ball, which Miller swats to long-on"
17.3,"Unadkat to Pooran, 1 run","steps down, making room, but Unadkat does well again, bowling short and angling it into the gut of Pooran, who loses his shape and swings blindly, mis-hitting the ball to deep square leg"
17.2,"Unadkat to Pooran, 2 runs","slower ball, targeting off stump, Pooran gets forward and whips it to deep midwicket"
17.1,"Unadkat to Rahul, OUT","caught at point! Unadkat screams, he's been vindicated, backing himself to come good against a man who's hit him all over the park, bowling full and just outside off. Rahul tries a calculated slice, hoping he can get it between point and short third man, in which case it would have been a boundary, but only ends up hitting straight at Archer"
16.6,"Archer to Miller, no run","beats him outside off with Miller stuck in his crease against a fullish, incoming delivery, trying to cut it through point"
16.5,"Archer to Miller, 2 runs",slices it behind point
16.4,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","looks for the yorker, but it ends up a really low full toss, which Rahul knocks down to long-on"
16.3,"Archer to Rahul, FOUR runs","picks the gap between cover and mid-off and it's with that sublime shot that he gets to his fifty. Sublime because Archer angles the shortish delivery well down leg, responding to the batsman making room for himself. But Rahul, once again, holds his shape and simply extends his back foot defensive while concentrating on picking the gap"
16.2,"Archer to Rahul, no run",picture perfect yorker as a free hit ball and even Rahul can only do enough to protect his stumps
16.2,"Archer to Miller, (no ball) 3 byes","off stump goes for a vacation, but Archer's overstepped! Rahul knows it though. He tells MIller to get over his shock and run off to the other end. So in the end, a super fast length ball that the left-hander plays all across and gets bowled may actually turn out to be useful for the batting team"
16.1,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball, into the deck, and cramping Rahul. The batsman gets a leading edge that lands just past the pitch, somewhere near mid-on."
15.6,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 bye",beats him with a seam-up yorker outside off. Rahul was trying to slice it past the keeper and get it fine to the third man boundary but no such luck
15.5,"Gopal to Rahul, no run","loops it into the blockhole on middle, Rahul pops it back to the bowler"
15.4,"Gopal to Miller, 1 run","flatter delivery, spinning away from the left-hander, Miller crunches it to long-off"
15.3,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","outside edge as once again Gopal hides the ball from the big-hitter, pitching it outside off, never allowing Rahul to get under it. He still goes for the flashy drive through cover but ends up with a single to short third man"
15.2,"Gopal to Rahul, no run",goes for the reverse sweep but the legbreak is just a little too far outside off for him to make contact. Good stuff from Gopal. He's got excellent smarts for the T20 game
15.1,"Gopal to Miller, 1 run",starts with a low full toss on leg stump which Miller whips to long-on
14.6,"Unadkat to Rahul, 2 runs","back of a length on leg stump, Rahul turns it to deep midwicket and makes it 20 off the over. That's 38 in two. Kings XI are on their way."
14.5,"Unadkat to Rahul, SIX runs","oooooover point! These are not easy hits! These need to be timed insanely well. Especially considering this is a near-yorker well outside leg stump, But Rahul leaps away to his left, making tons and tons of room, then works extra hard to get under the ball and lift it all the way. Blistering cricket."
14.4,"Unadkat to Miller, 1 run","another low full toss, but this one is slow and in line with the stumps, and the batsman is happy to push it down to long-on"
14.3,"Unadkat to Miller, SIX runs",leg-stump full toss and Miller makes it disappear. All the magic tricks are coming out now. Miller yanks his front leg back so he has a free swing of the arms and the flick shot sails over deep square leg
14.2,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run","yorker on middle and leg, but Rahul's managed to make enough room for himself that he can hammer it to extra cover"
14.1,"Unadkat to Rahul, FOUR runs","scoops it! See, it's like turning on a switch. It doesn't matter if he gets out now so he's prepared to take all the risks in the world. But even then, he picks the right bowler. Unadkat bowls length and across the right-hander, Rahul plants his front leg across, then bends low and finally shovels the ball well over the short boundary behind him. Good stuff"
13.6,"Sodhi to Miller, 2 runs","loopy delivery on leg stump, Miller whacks it to the left of long-on"
13.6,"Sodhi to Miller, 1 wide",legbreak pitching outside leg and turning further away. Guess what that's called  That's right. Bowler rattled
13.5,"Sodhi to Miller, SIX runs",flat-bats down the ground. I'm callin it. Miller is setting up for the googly. The legspinners are doling them out generously. This one is short and Miller just thumps it with a free swing of his arms
13.4,"Sodhi to Rahul, 1 run","good work by Turner at short fine leg, diving to his right at short fine leg. This - another pull from Rahul - looked set for the boundary again after Sodhi strays so very far down leg this time"
13.3,"Sodhi to Rahul, SIX runs","too short, and too good! This is the ball a batsman with a 75 strike-rate dreams about. Half-tracker. With plenty of width. Rahul really should have sent it all the way to Auckland. But he settles for the crowd behind deep square leg"
13.2,"Sodhi to Miller, 1 run","slugs a short ball on leg stump, which also doesn't spin, away to deep midwicket"
13.1,"Sodhi to Miller, 2 runs",opens up his body as he goes back so he can dispatch a short googly pitching on leg stump away to deep midwicket
12.6,"Gopal to Miller, 1 run","another googly, but this time, Miller goes back in his crease and hits with the turn to long-off. That's the time out"
12.5,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","down the track, but Gopal does really well, not only adjusting his length, but also sliding the ball into Rahul. The right-hander now has no choice but to nudge it to long-on"
12.4,"Gopal to Miller, 1 run",
12.3,"Gopal to Miller, no run",doesn't read the googly though as he plays across the line to a ball picked on leg stump and turning away. The flick shot results in a leading edge
12.2,"Gopal to Miller, FOUR runs","hard-hit sweep! He gets down on one knee against a length ball and that bat comes down on it, making sure he wouldn't top edge it. Good technique, and picking of length"
12.1,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","quicker delivery on middle stump, Rahul spots it and whips it to deep midwicket"
11.6,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run",flicks a fullish delivery on leg stump to deep midwicket
11.5,"Unadkat to Miller, 1 run","takes the pace off again while also hitting the deck. Miller is a little more aware of Unadkat's plans now, delaying his bat swing just enough that he can time the pull shot to deep square leg"
11.4,"Unadkat to Miller, no run",slower ball beats Miller. it hits a good length outside off and finds the batsman far too early with his push down the ground
11.3,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run","a whirl of the wrists sends a length ball against the angle across him to deep midwicket. He's good at hitting, this guy, he's just been waiting for the right time."
11.2,"Unadkat to Rahul, FOUR runs","outstanding shot! There's the skill he has with boundary-hitting. It's his first of the day, but he works it so well, making room outside leg, and even after the bowler follows him with a short ball, trying to cramp him, Rahul doesn't panic and simply lifts it over mid-off because there's no one in the deep"
11.1,"Unadkat to Miller, 1 run",punches the back of a length delivery to the right of mid-off
10.6,"Sodhi to Miller, 1 run","shimmies down the track but Sodhi spots it, pulls his length back and gives only a single to long-on"
10.5,"Sodhi to Rahul, 1 run","tosses it up on leg stump, Rahul turns it behind square leg"
10.4,"Sodhi to Miller, 1 run",sweeps a length ball on middle to deep square leg
10.3,"Sodhi to Rahul, 1 run",slices it through the covers to get off strike
10.2,"Sodhi to Rahul, no run","deceived by the dip. Rahul thinks he can flick it through midwicket and get more runs, but the ball dips and straightens to secure the leading edge"
10.1,"Sodhi to Rahul, 2 runs",shifts back in his crease to nudge the shortish delivery on leg stump to deep midwicket and pinches two. That is always his intention having played the ball gently
9.6,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","skids one through on a length outside off, punched to long-on"
9.5,"Gopal to Rahul, 2 runs","steps out, Shreyas drops short and Rahul punches this towards deep cover"
9.4,"Gopal to Miller, 1 run","swept fiercely, down to deep square"
9.3,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","eased with the spin again, down to long-off"
9.2,"Gopal to Miller, 1 run",works this past the diving midwicket fielder to get off the mark
9.1,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run",eased with the spin to long-off
8.6,"Sodhi to Miller, no run","sharp turn but this pitched on middle and leg, spun back in to hit the pad with Miller looking to work into the leg side"
8.5,"Sodhi to Rahul, 1 run",steps out and tucks this gently towards midwicket
8.4,"Sodhi to Agarwal, OUT","huge strike! Looks to go across the line, got down on one knee to slog sweep and ended up getting more elevation than distance. Archer takes an excellent catch at long-on. Was it all the pressure of runs being bottled up at KL Rahul's end? Royals can breathe easy for a bit. Agarwal was in sparkling form."
8.3,"Sodhi to Agarwal, 2 runs","gets well forward and turns this gently towards the vacant midwicket region, Sodhi had to run across to stop, by which time they were back for the second quite comfortably"
8.2,"Sodhi to Rahul, 1 run","drifts a length ball into middle and leg, tucked to deep midwicket"
8.1,"Sodhi to Agarwal, 1 run","drops short again, pulled all along the ground to deep midwicket"
7.6,"Gopal to Rahul, no run","skiddy length ball, punched to cover."
7.5,"Gopal to Agarwal, 1 run","picks this shortish googly, pulled to deep midwicket"
7.4,"Gopal to Agarwal, SIX runs","he's on a roll! Sees the flight, eyes light up as he gets to the pitch and belts this over long-off. Such wonderful timing"
7.3,"Gopal to Agarwal, FOUR runs","too short, Agarwal picks the length early and pulls to deep midwicket where Binny, another Karnataka man, loses his balance while trying to pull it back in. That said, you have to say he did wonderfully well in sprinting towards the ball."
7.2,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","shortens his length a touch, dabs wide of point"
7.1,"Gopal to Agarwal, 1 run","driven to sweeper cover, nicely tossed up"
6.6,"Sodhi to Rahul, no run","this one kept really, really low. Rahul shapes to pull but is almost done in by the skid, somehow managed to toe-end this."
6.5,"Sodhi to Agarwal, 1 run",flayed away but a good stop behind point to keep it to a single. This one was spinning away from the fielder there
6.4,"Sodhi to Agarwal, SIX runs","goes straight, and clears the ropes. Didn't get to the pitch but went through and timed the hell out of that"
6.3,"Sodhi to Agarwal, 2 runs","drops short, Agarwal rocks back and pulls to wide long-on"
6.2,"Sodhi to Rahul, 1 run",driven with the spin to sweeper cover
6.1,"Sodhi to Agarwal, 1 run","shortish to begin with, he taps this wide of cover for a quick single"
5.6,"Archer to Rahul, no run","goes full and straight on the stumps, works this to mid-on"
5.5,"Archer to Agarwal, 1 run","but Archer slants into the pads, tucked to fine leg"
5.4,"Archer to Gayle, OUT","now, that's one way to channel your anger and frustration. A Barbadian gets the big Jamaican. Archer runs his fingers over the seam to bowl this length ball that squares Gayle up with the deviation. And because Gayle has a poke, he gets a thin edge and Samson makes no mistake this time. Huge wicket and Archer is pumped."
5.3,"Archer to Gayle, 4 byes","beaten but Kings XI get four! Through with the pull even before the ball arrived, awkward bounce in front of Samson as he tries to grab on the half-volley and lets it through his legs"
5.2,"Archer to Gayle, no run","hits the hard lengths at 144.8kph, Gayle is cramped for room and defends back"
5.1,"Archer to Gayle, no run","looks to wallop this across the line, gets a thick inside edge to short fine."
4.6,"Kulkarni to Gayle, 1 run","slower length ball on off, bunted to point where Shreyas misfields and they pick a quick single"
4.5,"Kulkarni to Gayle, SIX runs","poor bowling. Tests him with a short ball but you can't do that when you bowl in the late 120s. Gayle arches back and helps it over to clear third man. Ah, this is so good to watch"
4.4,"Kulkarni to Gayle, FOUR runs","dug into the pitch, this one is sitting up nicely and Gayle just makes a hint of room and wallops behind point. Super shot"
4.3,"Kulkarni to Rahul, 1 run",scythes this shortish slower delivery to Binny at deep point
4.2,"Kulkarni to Rahul, no run","denied width, bunts this straight to cover"
4.1,"Kulkarni to Gayle, 1 run",squeezes this slower delivery towards point for a quick single
3.6,"Archer to Rahul, no run","cut away, but this is an excellent stop at cover point"
3.5,"Archer to Rahul, no run","nipbacker off a length on middle, tucked into the leg side again"
3.4,"Archer to Rahul, no run","hustled for pace with a 140.7kph shot of length delivery, Rahul hops back and tucks to square leg"
3.3,"Archer to Gayle, 1 run",uses the pace to steer this down to square third man
3.2,"Archer to Gayle, no run","scorching drive, straight to Binny at cover point"
3.1,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","short ball angling in towards the armpit, Rahul tucks this gently to square leg"
2.6,"Kulkarni to Gayle, no run","cutter on a length on leg stump, Gayle is squared up but manages to defend."
2.5,"Kulkarni to Gayle, FOUR runs","poor ball and punished! This is a full toss too far wide outside off, Gayle simply reaches out to get a thick edge past short third man"
2.4,"Kulkarni to Gayle, no run","slower ball this time, Gayle is squared up and takes his hands off the grip to get a thick edge, Samson dives to his left to stop that. Excellent glovework"
2.3,"Kulkarni to Rahul, 1 run",whips this length ball from outside off to deep square
2.2,"Kulkarni to Rahul, no run",stands tall and punches this to mid-off
2.1,"Kulkarni to Rahul, no run","punched on the up off the frontfoot, straight to extra cover"
1.6,"Unadkat to Gayle, no run",bunts it to Shreyas Gopal at short third man
1.5,"Unadkat to Gayle, SIX runs",he's walloped this over wide long-on! The Universe Boss has had enough sighters. Unadkat goes short of length and Gayle says thank you. Flat-batted with disdain
1.4,"Unadkat to Gayle, SIX runs","just eludes Archer at deep square! He was some way in, this pull wasn't all that well timed. Hung in the air for a long, long time. Jofra was out of position and was running backwards. Had he been right on the ropes, this would've been much easier."
1.3,"Unadkat to Gayle, no run","gets some inward movement off the pitch, Gayle is rooted to the crease as he blocks"
1.2,"Unadkat to Gayle, no run","length ball on the stumps, some zip off the pitch, defended back"
1.1,"Unadkat to Gayle, no run","angles in a length ball from wide of the crease, Gayle has a good look at it again as he defends"
0.6,"Kulkarni to Rahul, no run",defends a shortish delivery on off stump with ease
0.5,"Kulkarni to Gayle, 1 run",opens the face to steer a pitched up delivery on middle to deep third man
0.4,"Kulkarni to Gayle, no run",another leave from the big man as Kulkarni hits a good length while darting the ball across the left-hander
0.3,"Kulkarni to Gayle, no run","good length, outside off, no shot. #Weird"
0.2,"Kulkarni to Rahul, 1 run",waits on the back of a length delivery quite nicely and nudges it off his hips towards mid-on
0.1,"Kulkarni to Rahul, no run",lines up a good length ball angled into him on off stump and blocks. The angle is actually so acute that Rahul has to yank that front foot back a touch to make contact
18.6,"Negi to Pandya, 1 run",and that's all over. Pollard didn't even face a ball. Hardik swats this from outside off to long-on and they complete the win.
18.6,"Negi to Pandya, 1 wide",the pressure tells on Negi and he bowls it too far outside off
18.5,"Negi to Pandya, SIX runs",bye bye RCB their chances are disappearing with the ball. the ball is spinning away from him but he slog-sweeps it from well outside off and smashes it over wide long-on
18.4,"Negi to Pandya, FOUR runs","in his hitting arc again, and Hardik picks this up from outside off, almost on half-volley and swings this once bounce into the midwicket fence"
18.3,"Negi to Pandya, FOUR runs",smashed width offered outside off and clattered through extra cover. No chance of any fielder to stop it
18.2,"Negi to Pandya, SIX runs","that's some power didn't time it at all, too short and there to be hit, but Hardik got a thick top edge. Still enough power on it to carry it over the long-on boundary"
18.1,"Negi to Pandya, no run","swing and a miss! Hardik wanted to send that to Brabourne, went for a big swing. Grip and turn from outside off on a length, beats bat"
17.6,"Siraj to Pandya, 1 run","takes the pace off and keeps it on a length wide of off, Pandya punches it, rolls to mid-on off a thick inside edge"
17.6,"Siraj to Pandya, 1 wide",too far outside off stump again. He wants to keep it out of Hardik's reach but that will be a wide
17.5,"Siraj to Krunal, OUT","good length on the stumps, Krunal moves across and wants to flick it, but his timing's been awry all innings and he only lobs it up in the air. Deep midwicket takes a few steps in and gobbles the ball to end Krunal's laboured stay."
17.4,"Siraj to Pandya, 1 run","fuller outside off again, Hardik moves across and scoop-drives it. Long off's there now so he collects"
17.4,"Siraj to Pandya, 1 wide",that one will be a wide though. Well outside the tram line
17.3,"Siraj to Pandya, no run","just inside the tram-line and that will be a dot ball. Hardik lets it go, but it's not a wide"
17.2,"Siraj to Pandya, FOUR runs","that is a super shot, even if not well timed. Back of a length outside off and he only gets a toe-end to it but hits with enough power to make it travel. And gets the placement perfect, right back over the bowler"
17.1,"Siraj to Krunal, 1 run","good length on off again and drilled with power, but without timing, to Kohli at mid-off. He wants to pick it up and fire a throw in but doesn't collect cleanly"
16.6,"Saini to Pandya, FOUR runs","just eludes Tim Southee full ball, almost a yorker outside off and Hardik has seen mid-off up so he goes over him. No timing on that, gets it off the end of the bat. Southee running back hard and dives, but can only get a hand to it and can't stop it going into the boundary"
16.5,"Saini to Krunal, 1 run","good length angling across, Krunal smears it to extra cover inside the circle. No timing on that at all"
16.4,"Saini to Pandya, 1 run",length ball coming in a little and flicked off his hips to deep square leg
16.3,"Saini to Pandya, no run","another good ball, back of a length in the corridor again. Hardik's doing his thing of widening stance and moving across to set himself up to bash it through the leg side, but the pace of the ball as much as the tight line defeated him"
16.2,"Saini to Pandya, no run","beaten back of a length in the corridor and Hardik goes for the expansive drive, but doesn't connect. Was close to his outside edge"
16.1,"Saini to Pandya, FOUR runs","incredible it was back of a length but not that wide outside off as to give Hardik room to free his arms, but he short-arm slashes it anyway and it bounces just in front of the rope. Almost a six"
15.6,"Chahal to Pandya, 1 run","too short and down leg, paddled to deep square leg"
15.5,"Chahal to Krunal, 1 run",fuller outside off and he fetches the ball from there to sweep to deep midwicket
15.4,"Chahal to Krunal, no run","ooh there's that bounce again. Quicker one bowled outside off and spins in, bounces much higher than Krunal was expecting"
15.3,"Chahal to Yadav, OUT","caught at the long-off boundary came down the track to hit over the top, but gets only the toe-end of the bat. The ball travel more high than far and drops into long-off's waiting hands, stretched out over his head and caught cleanly while not over-balancing to go beyond the rope. RCB are not out of it yet, though Mumbai should still be favoured to win from here. He was trying to hit with the turn, but the ball perhaps spun a bit more than he budgeted for"
15.2,"Chahal to Yadav, 2 runs","googly, and he manages to whip it from close to his body over midwicket. Good fielding by Kohli at the boundary to keep it to two runs"
15.1,"Chahal to Yadav, no run","slider, hurries on to him and he has to chop it away while trying to give himself room"
14.6,"Negi to Yadav, 1 run","too much air and on leg stump, flicked to long-on off his toes"
14.5,"Negi to Krunal, 1 run","shimmy down the track and he launches this over extra cover, but there is protection in the deep"
14.4,"Negi to Krunal, no run",fuller and he wants to swat it away from one knee but finds midwicket
14.4,"Negi to Krunal, 1 wide","wanted to bowl it wide outside off, but ends up just outside the tram-line. That'll be wide"
14.3,"Negi to Yadav, 1 run","good length on the stumps and spinning away, he goes back and clips to midwicket"
14.2,"Negi to Yadav, FOUR runs","good shot, though not the best ball. Too short and Surya makes room to cut it powerfully past point"
14.1,"Negi to Yadav, no run","pitches on a length and spins away from the right hander sharply. Surya was looking to slap it into the offside, but pulls his bat out and has a look on his face almost as if the ball has personally insulted him"
13.6,"Ali to Krunal, no run","driven firmly, but straight back to Moeen, who stops the ball to complete an outstanding spell. 4-0-18-2"
13.5,"Ali to Krunal, no run","given some more air, defended"
13.4,"Ali to Krunal, no run","big appeal classic ball, pitches on a length and spins past the bat with Krunal trying to push at it. Parthiv appeals loudly but there's a clear gap between bat and ball"
13.3,"Ali to Yadav, 1 run","length outside off, he plays it carefully to short third man, was ready in case it spun in sharply"
13.2,"Ali to Krunal, 1 run","comes down the track, not quite to the pitch so adjusts and pushes it down to long-off"
13.1,"Ali to Yadav, 1 run","fullish on the stumps, clipped to long-on"
12.6,"Chahal to Krunal, no run","top spinner, gets it to bounce a bit more, Krunal was looking to come on the front foot had to hurriedly transfer weight back and dab it down"
12.5,"Chahal to Krunal, no run",comes down the track and defends it back to the bowler
12.4,"Chahal to Yadav, 1 run","almost yorker length, he chips it over the bowler's head and straight down, where long-on runs around to tidy up"
12.3,"Chahal to Yadav, no run","draws him on the front foot to defend, and spins enough to take a thin outside edge that rolls to point"
12.2,"Chahal to Yadav, FOUR runs","a little too full and he spotted the length early, went to sweep it powerfully from outside off to the deep square leg boundary"
12.1,"Chahal to Krunal, 1 run","fuller on the stumps, comes on the front foot to work it to deep midwicket"
11.6,"Ali to Yadav, no run","comes forward to push to cover, a mite early into the shot"
11.5,"Ali to Krunal, 1 run",makes some room and goes deep in his crease to cut this past point
11.4,"Ali to Krunal, no run","good length on middle spins past the bat, takes the outside edge to roll towards slip"
11.3,"Ali to Krunal, no run",stopped on him a bit possibly and bunted back to the bowler
11.2,"Ali to Krunal, no run","draws him forward to defend and drifts past bat onto pad, but he was too far ahead I think for a serious appeal"
11.1,"Ali to Yadav, 1 run","length ball outside off that doesn't turn in much, dabbed to short third man, very fine"
10.6,"Chahal to Krunal, FOUR runs","clever, clever shot by Krunal. Moved into position early and paddle-swept it from outside off, very very fine. Good enough to beat a despairing dive by Siraj who was sprinting from a square-ish fine leg"
10.5,"Chahal to Krunal, no run","length on the stumps, blocked back"
10.4,"Chahal to Krunal, no run","fullish outside off, defended into the offside"
10.3,"Chahal to Ishan, OUT","comes down once too often another skip down the track, Chahal saw him coming, pushed it well wide of the off stump and bowled a top spinner, so not only was it out of Kishan's reach, it also hurried through to Parthiv, who was waiting to whip the bails off. Kishan's adventurousness had paid off earlier, but Chahal has the last laugh"
10.2,"Chahal to Ishan, SIX runs","fetch that Ishan Kishan is skipping down the track as if there's a prize at the other end. Comes down again, and gets to the pitch beautifully, and smacks this over deep midwicket with one clean swing of the bat"
10.1,"Chahal to Yadav, 1 run","too full on legstump, swept to fine leg"
9.6,"Ali to Ishan, no run",
9.5,"Ali to Yadav, 1 run","length on middle, tries to turn it to the on side, closes the face a little early, gets a leading edge along the ground towards point"
9.4,"Ali to Yadav, no run",
9.3,"Ali to Yadav, SIX runs","that's an incredible short against the spin! Would have made Doug Walters proud! It's overpitched, yet, he goes inside out over extra cover and clears the man with consummate ease"
9.2,"Ali to Yadav, 2 runs","length outside off, it turns sharply back in again but Suryakumar deflects it from the keeper's gloves almost and gets a couple past short third-man"
9.1,"Ali to Ishan, 1 run","full on off, uses his wrists to work it towards long-on against the spin"
8.6,"Negi to Yadav, no run","full on off, comes forward, smothers the spin and defends safely"
8.5,"Negi to Ishan, 1 run","shapes to come down again, rocks back as the bowler fires it in short and just pushes it to long-on"
8.4,"Negi to Ishan, SIX runs",Negi adjusts and goes flatter around leg stump and from there Kishan has no danger as he skips down the wicket and hammers it flat over long-on
8.3,"Negi to Ishan, SIX runs","down the wicket and he gets to the pitch this time, avoiding the danger of the sharp turn on view and launches it down the ground"
8.2,"Negi to Ishan, no run","tossed up outside off, Kishan tries to smother the spin, doesn't get to the pitch and it spins between bat and pad and back to the keeper"
8.1,"Negi to Yadav, 1 run","length and angled in, tucked away towards squareleg"
7.6,"Ali to Yadav, 1 run","length on off, Suryakumar rocks back and turns it towards squareleg with the spin"
7.5,"Ali to Ishan, 1 run","length on the pads, tucked away to deep squareleg"
7.4,"Ali to de Kock, OUT","that's two in the over for Moeen! Length on middle, de Kock plays back when he should have been forward, it skids on rather that turning away and strikes him plumb in front. Moeen Ali has spun RCB back into the contest in four balls"
7.3,"Ali to de Kock, no run","full on middle, pushed back to the bowler"
7.2,"Ali to Yadav, 1 run","full outside off, turns back in again as he tries to work it towards midwicket and gets a thick inside edge to short fine-leg"
7.1,"Ali to Rohit Sharma, OUT","what a ripper and cleans him up! Length outside off and it turned viciously back into Rohit as he went to cut it late, and finally, RCB have a breakthrough"
6.6,"Negi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length outside off, pushed to deep cover"
6.5,"Negi to Rohit Sharma, no run","length on middle, nearly squares him up again but he plays late and with a straight bat, to his credit"
6.4,"Negi to de Kock, 1 run","and now he goes for the sweep, top edges it but it doesn't carry to deep squareleg"
6.3,"Negi to de Kock, no run","was that a chance? Too close for the cut, spins back in and it looked like he got an edge but the keeper couldn't hang on. Nothing going RCB's way"
6.2,"Negi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full on middle, tucked away towards squareleg"
6.1,"Negi to Rohit Sharma, no run","length outside off and that's gripped and turned square, beating Rohit, who luckily hadn't committed to the stroke"
5.6,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length on middle, nips back in a little, pushed towards midwicket for one"
5.5,"Saini to de Kock, 1 run","full on the pads, clipped to midwicket"
5.4,"Saini to de Kock, SIX runs","length around the hip and these two are matching each other shot for shot, picks it up and hammers a pull, flat and hard over deep squareleg"
5.3,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length outside off, Rohit steers it to third-man"
5.2,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs",full outside off and crunched through the covers. That wasn't a bad ball at all but there isn't much you can do when a batsman can hit the ball so sweetly on the rise
5.1,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on middle, solidly pushed to mid-on"
4.6,"Chahal to de Kock, no run","quicker one on off, out comes the reverse sweep but he can't beat the short third-man"
4.5,"Chahal to de Kock, no run","googly outside off, de Kock goes for the late dab to try and beat slip, but the fielder was alert to it and makes a smart diving stop to his left"
4.4,"Chahal to de Kock, FOUR runs",length on middle and de Kock goes aerial with the sweep this time and clears squareleg
4.3,"Chahal to de Kock, no run","tossed up on middle, googly, de Kock doesn't pick it and can't get any bat on it either"
4.2,"Chahal to de Kock, no run","length on middle, pushed to midwicket"
4.1,"Chahal to de Kock, 2 runs","full outside off, de Kock sweeps hard along the ground towards squareleg where the fielder saves a certain boundary but the fumble allows a couple, nonetheless"
3.6,"Siraj to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","length and wide outside off too much width and this is far too easy for Mumbai and their two openers, driven on the rise over cover for four"
3.5,"Siraj to de Kock, 1 run","length on middle, uses his wrists to turn it around towards midwicket and they scamper a single"
3.4,"Siraj to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full outside off, overpitched, crunching drive from Rohit but straight to cover"
3.3,"Siraj to Rohit Sharma, no run","length and closer to off stump, Rohit rocks back and defends to point"
3.2,"Siraj to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs",short outside off and slashed hard and flat over point for six
3.1,"Siraj to Rohit Sharma, no run","length on middle, Rohit comes forward and pushes it back to the bowler with a straight bat. Good length, however"

2.5,"Yadav to de Kock, no run",
2.4,"Yadav to de Kock, SIX runs",that's hoicked out of sight! Short on middle and he's picked that up high and handsome and far into the top tier at deep squareleg
2.3,"Yadav to de Kock, FOUR runs","length outside off, de Kock swings across the line and swings hard and so the outside edge flies over slip for four"
2.2,"Yadav to de Kock, no run","nearly rolls back onto the stumps! Full on off, hint of swing back in, de Kock defends it near his feet but had no clue where the ball was"
2.1,"Yadav to de Kock, FOUR runs",overpitched outside off and driven crisply through the covers for another four
1.6,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, no run","length outside off, better length and line, nips back in sharply again but the extra bounce here takes it over the off stump"
1.5,"Saini to de Kock, 1 run","full on the pads, clipped away to fine-leg to retain strike"
1.4,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","another one banged into the surface, jags back into Rohit, and he tucks it away towards squareleg"
1.3,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","another short one, Rohit picks it up again with one leg in the air, doesn't time it as well as the previous one in the over, the fine-leg fielder makes good ground to his left to keep it to two"
1.2,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, no run","length on off, rocks back and pushes it to cover"
1.1,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","short ball and nonchalantly picked up Rohit Sharma, sails over fine-leg for six"

0.1,"Yadav to de Kock, 1 wide","full on the pads, down the leg side and called wide but there was some swing on offer for Umesh"
19.6,"Malinga to Yadav, 2 byes","they steal two byes off the last ball Umesh has an almighty heave at it, and misses. They run for the bye, the keeper relays to Malinga, who has a shy and misses the stumps at his end, so they get another run"
19.5,"Malinga to Negi, OUT","straight up in the air once again, but it's just an easier catch for de Kock. Same spot, but it's the left-hander so it's backward point. Same shot as Nath too, down the track and trying to go over the top straight, but doesn't pick the slower ball, it flies off the outside edge in the air and into de Kock's gloves"
19.4,"Malinga to Negi, no run","slower ball in the corridor, and Negi can't get bat on it, while trying to run it down to third man"
19.3,"Malinga to Nath, OUT","gives him the charge while giving himself room, but only gets a top edge that flies high over his head. De Kock calls for it, runs till backward square leg and catches it. Nath won't be happy, his tardiness could have cost AB his wicket and he's thrown it away next ball"
19.2,"Malinga to AB, 1 run, OUT","Direct hit from long-on might have AB in trouble And he's out! That's brilliant from Kieron Pollard. AB had whipped this to long-on and wanted a second. He reached the non-striker's end and turned back immediately. Nath was slow to respond so he was trying to regain his crease, but Pollard scored a direct hit from long-on and AB's bat is six inches away from the crease! Unfortunate end to an innings that started slow but had hit AB-mode now"
19.1,"Malinga to AB, SIX runs","that's just dispatched leg side full toss low down, AB connects and how! Pinging sound of the bat and it travels way into the top tier"
18.6,"Bumrah to AB, 1 run","yorker outside off, AB shovels it to midwicket and they settle for the single so that he can keep strike"
18.5,"Bumrah to AB, no run","pinged on the helmet Bumrah has bowled a short ball so pacy, AB is late on it. Dug this in and put a lot of shoulder in it, got it to rise sharply. AB was moving back and across, wanted to pull it into downtown Mumbai, but misses it and is clattered on the helmet. Takes a breather with the physio to check that all's fine. It is."
18.4,"Bumrah to AB, no run","through the legs that time. Top contest between a top bowler and top batsman. Bumrah doesn't fall for the bluff, keeps it yorker length on stumps. AB was moving across, tries to Natmeg it, but misses the ball"
18.3,"Bumrah to AB, FOUR runs","that's amazing AB wide and open stance again, which means even though Bumrah gets it almost yorker length on off, AB just stays still and drives it to past cover"
18.2,"Bumrah to AB, FOUR runs","great placement AB's finding his groove now, cleared his front leg and opened his stance, low full toss on off and he drives it through extra cover"

17.6,"Malinga to Nath, 1 run","full and straight, low full toss. He gets behind it and turns it to square leg"
17.5,"Malinga to Stoinis, OUT","foxed him totally another slower ball, Stoinis has no clue about it. Malinga rolls his fingers over the ball, gets in on a length in line with the stumps, Stoinis is pushing at it way too early, it takes the leading edge to lob to cover, who takes it with both hands above his head"
17.4,"Malinga to Stoinis, no run","yorker first up, and a slower yorker at that. Stoinis just pats it back to Malinga"
17.3,"Malinga to AB, 1 run","back of a length outside off, cut fiercely but there is a deep cover"
17.2,"Malinga to AB, SIX runs","whoa that's an AB special. Gets the length wrong, it's a full toss on leg and AB moves across to unleash that trademark paddle-pull that sends the ball soaring past the boundary"
17.1,"Malinga to Ali, OUT","slower ball, taken at deep square leg. Malinga strikes immediately on return and he's got rid of the dangerman. Moeen was looking to whip it with his wrists over the boundary again, but the lack of pace means he ends up mis-timing it, and it lobs up to deep square leg for an easy catch"
16.6,"Bumrah to Ali, 1 run","full on the stumps, he clears his leg and wants to send it over cow corner but the ball trickles to square leg off the toe end. They get only one run, but that also brings up Moeen's fifty"

16.4,"Bumrah to AB, 1 run","is the dew getting heavier? Another low full toss from Bumrah - I'm guessing he's trying for yorkers, but not nailing them - but AB isn't able to swat it away with timing or power, to midwicket"

16.2,"Bumrah to Ali, 2 runs","back of a length on the stumps, pulled to midwicket off the under-edge"
16.1,"Bumrah to AB, 3 runs","full toss, he wants to go hard at it, but doesn't get the timing. Sends it straight back. Pollard's charging in from long-on to keep them to a single but fumbles. He has to scramble to prevent it from reaching the boundary. Fifty for AB, not one of his more fluent ones"
15.6,"Behrendorff to Ali, SIX runs","there is no margin for error Moeen is in some touch. This ends up as half-volley outside off and he unleashes a punchy cover drive, doesn't bother to keep the ball down and doesn't need to, because it goes right over the boundary"
15.5,"Behrendorff to Ali, no run","gets the yorker outside off going, and it sneaks under Moeen's bat. He was trying to glide it down to third man"
15.4,"Behrendorff to Ali, SIX runs","boom too short and Moeen rocks back and pulls powerfully, well over deep midwicket"
15.3,"Behrendorff to Ali, FOUR runs",shot that's some sublime timing. Too full outside off and Moeen just punch-drives it to the extra cover boundary. Hardly had any follow through
15.2,"Behrendorff to Ali, no run","slower ball, back of a length outside off. Moeen is way too early into his pull and the ball thuds into his chest"

13.5,"Chahar to Ali, 1 run",
13.4,"Chahar to Ali, SIX runs","bursts through Suryakumar Yadav's hands at deep extra cover another dropped chance off Rahul Chahar in the over. Moeen took a big stride out and played the lofted drive over extra cover. Didn't time it perfectly, but Surya, running across couldn't hold on"

13.2,"Chahar to AB, FOUR runs","reverse sweep the last ball doesn't matter, AB comes forward and plays a perfect reverse sweep that beats slip and short third man"
13.1,"Chahar to AB, no run","was giving himself room to go big over extra cover, but ends up getting a thin outside edge. De Kock can't hold on. That'll go down as a dropped chance"

12.5,"Malinga to Ali, 1 run","length ball, slowed it up a bit, on the stumps. Moeen pushes at it, and it pops towards square leg off a high inside edge"

12.3,"Malinga to AB, SIX runs","bang that's a more convincing shot from AB! Too short and he transfers weight back, stays still and pulls it powerfully. Well into the stands behind square leg"
12.2,"Malinga to Ali, 1 run","back of a length but it doesn't bounce at all, Moeen steers it to short third man from knee-height"

11.6,"Chahar to AB, 1 run",
11.5,"Chahar to AB, no run","pops up but just in front of Chahar bounce and turn, big turn, takes AB by surprise. Pitches on a length on leg and spins sharply, AB was looking to play it into the offside, but has to try and get his bat out of the way because of the bounce. Ends up popping in the air off the high part of the bat, but just in front of Chahar, who charged in for a few steps"

10.6,"Pandya to AB, 1 run","down the track, but Hardik bowled that well wide of off, and de Villiers wanted to flay it through the offside but ends up under-edging to long-on. His timing's been very un-AB like this innings so far"

10.3,"Pandya to AB, SIX runs","top-edged six the pressure has been building on AB, who hasn't managed to get away. He gets six here, but not where he wanted to. Short ball, he went for the pull, it climbed on him a bit more and takes the top edge to sail straight behind the keeper"
10.2,"Pandya to Ali, 1 leg bye","full ball on the pads, he wants to tickle it fine but can't get bat on it. They get a leg-bye with the ball rolling to short fine leg"

0.1,"Behrendorff to Patel, no run",stifled appeal as Parthiv is struck seemingly in front playing across the line to a full inducker but a clear inside edge saves him
18.5,"Rabada to Ahmed, OUT",bowled him! The perfect yorker to complete a perfect defence of what looked like a below-par score but has proved to be more than enough as the Capitals stretch their winning streak to three and SRH go down for the third time in succession

5.2,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run","fuller on the stumps, Warner stays put this time and pushes it to mid-off for a single"
5.1,"Rabada to Warner, no run","147 kph outside off. Warner was giving himself a lot of room, backing away, but Rabada keeps it on a sixth stump line and very full. Warner can't rech it"
4.6,"Sharma to Warner, 1 run","short one again, but on middle stump so he doesn't allow Warner to free his arms. He executes a short-arm pull to deep square leg"
4.5,"Sharma to Warner, no run","nice work by short fine leg, Amit Mishra dives to his left to stop the ball. Short ball on leg stump, Warner swivels to pull, but thanks to Mishra, gets no runs"
4.4,"Sharma to Warner, no run","too full and Warner wanted to drill that back, but it was the slower one. Don't see those too often from Ishant and Warner didn't read it. Mistimes the drive to mid-on"
4.3,"Sharma to Bairstow, 1 run","under-edges it past the stumps and they steal a single! back of a length on off, he wanted to steer it away with a horizontal bat, but gets the bottom edge. The ball bounces and goes past the stumps"
4.3,"Sharma to Bairstow, 1 wide",follows with a bouncer outside off but too high and that'll be a wide
4.2,"Sharma to Bairstow, 2 runs","terrific shot slightly slower, Bairstow waited a fraction and used his wrists to whip it off his toes to deep midwicket. Morris runs around and puts in a diving save"
4.1,"Sharma to Warner, 1 run","Warner's trying to give himself room against Ishant, but Ishant's following him. Length ball on leg stump, tucks him up, he ends up jabbing it into the offside"

1.5,"Rabada to Bairstow, FOUR runs","strays in line, on the pads and all Bairstow has to do is tickle it fine. The fine leg is inside the circle, so no chance for any fielder to cut that off"
1.4,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run",swiped to mid-off for a quick single
1.3,"Rabada to Warner, no run","half chance put down by Rabada. Dug this in short and quick, Warner went for the pull, gets it very high on the bat and the ball pops back straight, dipping on Rabada in his follow through. He goes down but can only get a finger tip to it"

18.5,"Sandeep to Paul, 1 leg bye","appeal for lbw turned down as the batsman walked across and tried to tickle it fine. SRH review upon the bowler's insistence, and it would have missed leg"

16.2,"Ahmed to Pant, OUT","another one-handed shot from Pant leads to his dismissal at a highly inopportune moment!

11.3,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, 1 leg bye","stifled appeal from the keeper, more for the beauty of a delivery than any real chance of a wicket! Full on off, looked to turn it to the legside, squared him up completely and took the pad on the way to short third-man"

8.1,"Shankar to Iyer, 1 run","good length on the stumps, punched down the ground"
7.6,"Abhishek to Munro, OUT","the bowler has the last laugh! He's bowled a leg-cutter with back-spin, which is a smart thing to do with Munro looking to hit with the one spinning into him. He bowls this wider of the stumps too, and Munro wants to slap this hard, but the spin ends up taking it a bit away from him and he gets a thin edge through to the keeper. Good catch by Bairstow"
7.5,"Abhishek to Munro, SIX runs","nails the shot coming down the track this time  Delayed his shimmy a tad, and Abhishek couldn't adjust his length. Munro dances down and gets it in the slot, picks it up for a mighty hit way over long -on"

7.3,"Abhishek to Munro, 1 run","well bowled, he spotted Munro charging down the track and shortened his length while keeping it close to the batsman's body. Munro can only push it to long-off"

5.4,"Ahmed to Iyer, 1 run","angling into him, defends with soft hands to silly point and they run for a quick single. Early call and they would have made it, even if there was a direct hit by the fielder running in to under-arm it"

3.2,"Ahmed to S Dhawan, OUT","bouncer gets him Khaleel Ahmed is having a great comeback. Banged this in short and got it to climb over the shoulder outside off. Bad choice of shot from Dhawan, trying to pull it from just over shoulder height outside off.

2.3,"Sandeep to Munro, no run","good length, punched to cover"
2.2,"Sandeep to Munro, FOUR runs","no slip and the edge goes for four Wonder why the slip was removed. The extra bounce has got two edges already. This one did it again, bounced outside off from back of a length and Munro slashed hard at it. Got a thick outside edge that ran to the boundary"
2.1,"Sandeep to Munro, no run","good length on off stump, defended towards mid-off"
1.6,"Ahmed to Munro, 1 leg bye","nipping into him from a length outside off, he wanted to work it away but it takes the thigh pad and rolls to short third man. Dhawan charges for a quick single"
1.5,"Ahmed to Shaw, OUT","got him extra bounce does the trick. Kept it on a hard length but close to the off stump, not at cutting width. Shaw went for the cut anyway, but only ends up edging it behind. Khaleel's successful immediately on his return"
1.4,"Ahmed to Shaw, no run",
1.3,"Ahmed to S Dhawan, 3 runs","down the track and over the in-field reached the pitch of the ball outside off and wanted to go straighter than he ended up, splices it but over cover. Another long chase and the ball is pulled in, in front of the extra cover boundary"

19.4,"Chawla to Jadeja, 2 runs",backs away and punches this into the gap at deep cover to bring up the winning runs.  Chennai Super Kings consolidate their position at the top.  Seventh win in eight games for them. KKR slump to their third straight loss and have a lot of soul-searching to do. They concerns will multiply further as Andre Russell didn't take the field after hobbling off early in the chase.
19.3,"Chawla to Raina, 1 run","too short, he whips this to deep backward square leg"
19.2,"Chawla to Jadeja, 1 run",slaps this short ball to long-on

18.3,"Gurney to Jadeja, FOUR runs",leading edge and this flies over short third man. This is a full delivery which he looks to flick. Lucky runs
18.2,"Gurney to Jadeja, FOUR runs","steps out and hits this straight back over the bowler's head. Manufactured the length by going over, hit it very well."

15.5,"Narine to Jadeja, no run","spins back in from length on off, defended"
15.4,"Narine to Dhoni, OUT","struck plumb in front! Dhoni reviews, but he seems to be stone dead. This is a full delivery, spins back in and Dhoni is hit on the pad as he plays down the wrong line. He's well outside the line on the forward push, the ball beats the inside edge to hit the pad. Portion of leg stump visible at the point of impact. Ball tracker says this would've smashed leg stump. Excellent decision from umpire Rod Tucker. We criticise umpires when they don't get it right, so you have to give them credit where due."
15.3,"Narine to Dhoni, no run","sharp turn back in, Dhoni looks to nudge it into the leg side but this hits him on the thigh pad as there's extra bounce"

14.4,"Gurney to Raina, FOUR runs",poor ball! Full toss on the pads and Raina tickles this past short fine. Easy pickings.
14.3,"Gurney to Raina, 2 runs","goes slower and fuller for the third time in a row, he nurdles this into the gap at square leg, top-notch running"
14.2,"Gurney to Dhoni, 1 run","slower length ball again, on leg stump, tucked behind square"
14.1,"Gurney to Raina, 1 run","slower length ball, pulled to wide long-on"

13.5,"Chawla to Dhoni, 1 run","cuts wide of Rana, who does well to stop it at point"
13.4,"Chawla to Raina, 1 run","flatter length ball on middle and leg, nudged behind square on the leg side"
13.3,"Chawla to Raina, SIX runs",steps out and wallops this straight. Handsomely done. Hits the black sightboard in front of the sightscreen. Chawla slowed it down trying to give it revs but has been outfoxed by his one-time state mate
13.2,"Chawla to Raina, FOUR runs","cut away beautifully! Drops short, he makes room and steers wide of short third man"
13.1,"Chawla to Raina, no run","googly on a length, Raina defends from the crease"
12.6,"Kuldeep to Raina, 1 run",googly which he looks to drive but gets a thick inside edge to deep midwicket
12.5,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, 1 run",slapped to deep cover
12.4,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, 2 runs","full toss that he's turned to deep square for two. Very, very easy"
12.3,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, SIX runs","bye bye, ball. This is a super hit. Gets right to the pitch and muscles it over long-on. No problems with the shot this time, bang off the middle."
12.2,"Kuldeep to Dhoni, 2 runs","mistimed lofted hit! Survives. Oh, dear. Dhoni's heart would've been pumping. He stepped out to go over long-on but this was the wrong'un and he got a leading edge."
12.1,"Kuldeep to Raina, 1 run","driven past point, where there's a misfield"
11.6,"Chawla to Dhoni, no run","flatter one on middle and leg, tucks this to short midwicket."

11.3,"Chawla to Raina, 1 run",driven down to long-off
11.2,"Chawla to Dhoni, 1 run","cuts wide of cover and scampers quick single. Hint of confusion in the running, a direct hit from Shubman Gill and it would've been interesting."
11.1,"Chawla to Jadhav, OUT","beautiful bowling from Chawla! He's been so, so consistent for them over the years, delivers unfailingly. Gets this to drift in on a length from wide of the crease, spins away just a touch and Jadhav is struck on the pad as he plays all around it, struck plumb in front of middle and off."
10.6,"Kuldeep to Jadhav, 1 run",whips this into the gap at wide long-on
10.5,"Kuldeep to Jadhav, FOUR runs",drops short and he clobbers this! Rocks back and wallops it between deep midwicket and long-on
10.4,"Kuldeep to Jadhav, no run","nicely tossed up again, he lunges forward and smothers the spin"
10.3,"Kuldeep to Jadhav, no run","flatter length ball on middle and leg, worked towards midwicket"
10.2,"Kuldeep to Jadhav, SIX runs","swept very, very well. Clears deep square. Hint of risk because he's sweeping a wrong'un, but got just enough bat to clear the ropes."
10.1,"Kuldeep to Jadhav, no run","goes right back to defend, this one keeps a touch low and Jadhav nearly dragged one back"
9.6,"Chawla to Jadhav, 1 run",taps a length delivery into point
9.5,"Chawla to Jadhav, FOUR runs","and now a lovely bit of a touch play as he opens the face and guides this to third man, such delicate use of the wrists"
9.4,"Chawla to Jadhav, FOUR runs","what a stroke! Tossed up again outside off, this is a wonderful lofted drive, inside-out over cover, fantastic timing and placement"
9.3,"Chawla to Jadhav, no run","full at off stump, bowled quite slowly, tapped towards cover and uncertainty in the running"
9.2,"Chawla to Jadhav, no run",short on the pads but he gets away with it as the pull finds square leg
9.1,"Chawla to Rayudu, OUT","strikes first ball! A wicket for the time out? Full outside off, Rayudu's eyes light up at the drive but he doesn't keep it down. Firmly struck but straight to cover"
8.6,"Kuldeep to Rayudu, 1 run","touch short, pulled to deep midwicket"
8.5,"Kuldeep to Raina, 1 run","back of a length outside off, square drives to deep point"
8.4,"Kuldeep to Raina, no run",pushed to the covers
8.3,"Kuldeep to Raina, no run","nearly a mix-up! Tapped to the on side, Rayudu came racing up for the single but had to a swift(ish) turn"
8.2,"Kuldeep to Rayudu, 1 run","full at off stump, driven through the covers"
8.1,"Kuldeep to Raina, 1 run","full outside off, driven in the air and it skims down to long-off"
7.6,"Narine to Raina, 1 run","a shorter delivery, he plays back and drives to long-on"
7.5,"Narine to Raina, FOUR runs","gets the line wrong, it's full outside off, tickled away to fine leg neatly put away from Raina"
7.4,"Narine to Rayudu, 1 run","full at the stumps, a bottom-handed whip to long-on"
7.4,"Narine to Rayudu, 1 wide","this slips down the leg side, he goes for a paddle-sweep and doesn't make contact, rebounds off DK's gloves"
7.3,"Narine to Raina, 1 run",pushed down the ground
7.2,"Narine to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length outside off, swung down to long-on"
7.1,"Narine to Raina, 1 run","over the wicket, full at off stump, pushed to the covers"

6.2,"Prasidh to Raina, 1 run","full, outside leg, clipped off the pads to long leg"
6.1,"Prasidh to Raina, no run","over the wicket, beats the outside edge with one pushed across outside off, Raina chasing it with a drive"
5.6,"Narine to Rayudu, no run","full at the stumps, a dead-bat block. Terrific start from Narine"
5.5,"Narine to Rayudu, no run",plays back and pushes from outside off to midwicket
5.4,"Narine to Rayudu, no run","this spins again, quite sharply from a straight line, bounce as well as it takes the thigh pad"
5.3,"Narine to du Plessis, OUT","off stump out of the ground! Full at off stump, du Plessis eyes up a slog sweep, held back enough to defeat the stroke and it turned. Nicely bowled. Much needed for KKR"
5.2,"Narine to du Plessis, no run",driven off the back foot to cover
5.1,"Narine to du Plessis, no run","over the wicket, back of a length, pushed to cover"
4.6,"Prasidh to Raina, FOUR runs","wrong line again, slips into the pads, flicked wide of short fine leg the good stuff undone by the poor stuff"
4.5,"Prasidh to Raina, no run","fuller, at off stump, touch of leading edge as he closes the face"
4.4,"Prasidh to Raina, no run",gives himself room outside leg stump then plays and misses as he aims to play square through the off side against a back-of-a-length delivery
4.3,"Prasidh to Raina, FOUR runs","short again, but angled into the body this time, neatly flicked off his hip to fine leg"
4.2,"Prasidh to Raina, no run","round the wicket, short of a length at off stump, defends this while jumping in the crease nicely bowled"
4.1,"Prasidh to Raina, no run","over the wicket, short of a length, jumps behind the line and plays to the leg side"
3.6,"Gurney to Raina, 1 run","full outside off, drives to mid-off and runs with the shot needs to get a wriggle on but he's fine"
3.5,"Gurney to Raina, FOUR runs","fuller, at the stumps, sweetly flicked through midwicket"
3.4,"Gurney to Raina, no run","another lbw, but Raina has reviewed! Over the wicket, good length and straight, takes Raina on the knee roll. Oh, wait! There's an inside edge. Raina did review straightaway. Umpire Tucker smiles and indicates he had no chance of hearing that"
3.3,"Gurney to du Plessis, 1 run","a slower ball, straight, worked off the stumps down to long leg"
3.2,"Gurney to Raina, 1 run","over the wicket, good length delivery outside off, tucked into the leg side"
3.1,"Gurney to Watson, OUT","trapped lbw! More excellent bowling from Gurney, angled in from round the wicket, fullish length, beats the inside edge and catches Watson on the back leg in front of all three"
2.6,"Russell to du Plessis, no run","short again, touch quicker at 131kph, du Plessis tries to scoop again but is beaten this time"
2.5,"Russell to du Plessis, FOUR runs","that's even better from Faf! A masterclass. Russell gets this fuller at the stumps, du Plessis goes down on his back knee and paddles it wide of short fine leg"
2.4,"Russell to du Plessis, FOUR runs","brilliant batting! Not great bowling. It's short again, this time du Plessis walks across the crease and scoops it over his shoulder to fine leg"
2.3,"Russell to du Plessis, FOUR runs","goes a touch fuller, but it's back-to-back boundaries as du Plessis dismissively swings across the line off the front foot"
2.2,"Russell to du Plessis, FOUR runs","a short delivery, at a gentle 126kph, du Plessis latches on and pulls high over midwicket"

1.4,"Gurney to Watson, 1 run","short of a length, steered through point to the sweeper"
1.3,"Gurney to Watson, no run","well bowled, nips back at Waston and there's a strangled appeal for lbw, not especially close to that outside the line of off stump. But some nibble"
1.2,"Gurney to Watson, no run","back of a length, angled in from round the wicket, defended to the bowler"
1.1,"Gurney to du Plessis, 1 run","round the wicket, full outside off, driven to mid-off"
0.6,"Prasidh to Watson, no run","back of a length at off stump, better length, defended to the off side. A mixed bag of an opening over"

0.4,"Prasidh to du Plessis, no run","full outside off, left alone"

0.2,"Prasidh to Watson, 1 run","better delivery, drags the length, takes a thick inside edge to the leg side"
0.1,"Prasidh to Watson, FOUR runs","what a way to start! Full and straight, Watson just leans into a perfect on drive. Won't see better"
19.6,"Thakur to Chawla, OUT","magnificent yorker! Curved in late to scythe through the gap between bat and pad. Dhoni lobs the ball back to Shardul, who effects a run-out at the bowler's end as Kuldeep was nearly at the other end looking for a bye."
19.5,"Thakur to Gill, OUT",pulled but straight down Jadeja's throat at deep midwicket. Gill looked to clear the biggest boundary at Eden.
19.4,"Thakur to Gill, no run",drilled on the bounce to mid-off
19.3,"Thakur to Gill, 2 runs","sliced over cover, down to Jadhav in the deep on the bounce, excellent running"
19.2,"Thakur to Gill, no run","slapped back! Shardul put his right hand out on the followthrough but can't grab it. Ufff, that should hurt. Don't even think of calling it a missed chance"
19.1,"Thakur to Chawla, 1 run",tucks this gently towards square leg to bring Shubam Gill back on strike
19.1,"Thakur to Chawla, 1 wide","slips this short and wide outside off, Chawla looks to reach out to slap that behind point but misses. Wide called"
18.6,"Chahar to Chawla, 1 run","fetches the pull from outside off, down to deep square"
18.5,"Chahar to Gill, 1 run","ugly hoick across the line, no timing, off a thick inside edge to deep midwicket"
18.4,"Chahar to Gill, no run","excellent yorker, somehow he manages to dig this out"
18.3,"Chahar to Chawla, 1 run",uses the pace to help this down to third man
18.2,"Chahar to Gill, 1 run","flicks uppishly, on the bounce to deep square leg"
18.1,"Chahar to Gill, no run","slower ball, wide ball or is it? No, not given as umpire Nandan reckons this was within the wide line. Touch-and-go call"
17.6,"Thakur to Gill, 1 run","full and wide outside off, carved away to deep point. Top over, just four off it"
17.5,"Thakur to Gill, no run",sways out of the way of this slower bouncer after initially shaping to pull
17.4,"Thakur to Chawla, 1 run","hits the hard lengths by bowling on middle, tucked to deep midwicket"
17.3,"Thakur to Gill, 1 run",works this length delivery to deep midwicket
17.2,"Thakur to Karthik, OUT","slices high in the air, but only as far as long-off. It's Faf the man again. Excellent change of pace from Shardul, went for a knuckleball that he's been working on for a while. DK doesn't quite get under the length, which means he gets more elevation than distance."
17.1,"Thakur to Gill, 1 run",turns this length delivery down to long-on
16.6,"Tahir to Gill, 1 run",leading edge down to long-off
16.5,"Tahir to Karthik, 1 run",driven firmly to deep cover
16.4,"Tahir to Karthik, 2 runs","fired full on the stumps, turned towards the man coming in from deep square"

15.2,"Santner to Karthik, 1 run",swept all along the ground to deep backward square leg
15.1,"Santner to Gill, 1 run",driven down to long-off
14.6,"Tahir to Gill, 1 run",driven firmly to sweeper cover
14.5,"Tahir to Russell, OUT","Tahir has his revenge! Russell looks to go big again, the length is a touch shorter so he doesn't quite get the same elevation. Dhruv Shorey the substitute fielder runs in, this is flat mind you, and he has to be mindful of this whacking his face at that pace. But no worries, he still manages to dive fully forward to complete a super catch. The crowd goes quiet."
14.4,"Tahir to Russell, SIX runs","gone, fetch that from the High Court! The long-on fielder was looking away. This was absolutely muscled. Too much flight, Russell gets down on one knee and whacks this against the turn."
14.3,"Tahir to Russell, no run","defended back, Tahir sprints to his left to stop"
14.2,"Tahir to Russell, FOUR runs","belts the first ball to the deep midwicket boundary. No timing even though he went really hard, looked like it came off a thickish inside edge. No holding back. This is DreRuss time, buckle up"
14.1,"Tahir to Lynn, OUT","he's hit this to deep square, where Shardul Thakur takes an excellent catch moving to his right. Lynn went across a touch and then swung acoss the line, didn't quite middle it as well as he would've liked."
14.1,"Tahir to Lynn, 1 wide","spins away from way outside off, Lynn looks to reach out but leaves. Wide called"
13.6,"Jadeja to Karthik, FOUR runs",swept wide of short fine leg. Used the pace beautifully to paddle. 23 off the over.
13.5,"Jadeja to Karthik, no run","slowed it down nicely, hint of bounce off a length, DK defends."
13.4,"Jadeja to Lynn, 1 run",chops this to short third man and they sneak in a single
13.3,"Jadeja to Lynn, SIX runs","two short-balls, how about going full thinks Jadeja. It's a good idea, except Lynn knows what's coming. He stays inside the crease, waits for this and drills it over long-on. Three in a row!"
13.2,"Jadeja to Lynn, SIX runs","makes room again, this time Jadeja looks to fire it into the body but drops short again, Lynn muscles this over deep midwicket. Sensational"
13.1,"Jadeja to Lynn, SIX runs","makes room, it helps that Jadeja drops short and Lynn uses the width to wallop this over extra cover. Off the backfoot, remember. Too much muscle. What power. Sensational"
12.6,"Santner to Karthik, no run",gets well forward and defends
12.5,"Santner to Lynn, 1 run","steps out to loft but yorked himself as Santner fired it in, squeezed wide of midwicket"
12.4,"Santner to Karthik, 1 run",gentle bunt into the covers
12.3,"Santner to Karthik, no run","slowed it down nicely, DK lunges forward and defends into the covers"
12.2,"Santner to Lynn, 1 run",backs away and slaps this length ball to Jadeja at long-off
12.2,"Santner to Karthik, 2 wide","sweeps and misses. Rare miss from MS, they sneak in a run"
12.1,"Santner to Karthik, 2 runs",drifting into the pads and he works this into the gap between deep midwicket and deep square
11.6,"Chahar to Karthik, 1 run",chops this down to third man
11.5,"Chahar to Lynn, 1 run",punches this into the covers for an easy single
11.4,"Chahar to Lynn, SIX runs","pulled into the stands at fine leg! Too short, slipping down leg and that's like giving Lynn some rosogullas. All he had to do was use the pace. Much-needed for KKR"
11.3,"Chahar to Karthik, 1 run","hit on the helmet, lobs wide of point. DK was through with the pull even before the ball arrived."
11.2,"Chahar to Lynn, 1 run","shaped to flat-bat this over the bowler's head, but ended up bunting it into the off side"
11.1,"Chahar to Lynn, no run","slower length ball, punched to extra cover at the edge of the ring"
10.6,"Tahir to Lynn, 1 run",flays this shortish delivery to sweeper cover
10.5,"Tahir to Lynn, no run",defended back to the bowler
10.4,"Tahir to Uthappa, OUT","Faf, you absolute ripper! What a magical catch. Uthappa doesn't read the legbreak properly, looks to go straighter but this turns to take the leading edge. Went high, really high, and Faf had to run it a good 20-25 yards from the long-off fence. Having done all the hard work, he then realised this will dip on him and so he puts in a full-stretch dive and gets his fingers completely underneath the ball as it descends. Stunning, absolutely stunning."
10.3,"Tahir to Lynn, 1 run",works this down to long-on for an easy single
10.2,"Tahir to Rana, OUT","holed out to long-on and Tahir is on a celebratory run, like he does always. Right intent, wrong execution. This one dipped on him a touch and spun a touch extra to take the inside half of the bat. Easy catch."
10.1,"Tahir to Rana, 2 runs","superb running! Gentle nudge into the leg side, deep midwicket had to come in a long way by which time Rana had made it"
9.6,"Jadeja to Rana, 1 run","straighter, tucked off the pads into midwicket"
9.5,"Jadeja to Rana, no run",drives into the off side and can't find a gap three dots in a row

9.3,"Jadeja to Rana, no run","full outside off, driven to the off side and Jadeja gets across"
9.2,"Jadeja to Rana, FOUR runs","excellent placement, more with from Jadeja, Rana quickly onto the cut shot and places it between short third man and backward point"
9.1,"Jadeja to Lynn, 1 run",pushed a length ball through the off side
8.6,"Tahir to Rana, no run","nicely bowled, straight and back of a length, played to the on side"

8.3,"Tahir to Lynn, 1 run","back of a length, straight, pushed wide of the bowler to long-off"

7.3,"Jadeja to Lynn, 1 run","back of a length outside off, Lynn staying leg side of the ball, driven firmly to deep cover"
7.3,"Jadeja to Lynn, 1 wide","fired down the leg side, Lynn missed his sweep"

7.1,"Jadeja to Lynn, 1 run","bowled quickly into the surface, back of a length, pushed down to long-off"
6.6,"Santner to Lynn, 1 run","that was well bowled, saw Lynn coming, fired it in back of a length and he had to adjust, pushing down to long-on"
6.5,"Santner to Lynn, no run","full and straight, driven back to the bowler"
6.4,"Santner to Lynn, SIX runs","top shot! That's into the second tier straight down the ground. Wonderful shot from Lynn, skips down the pitch, a crunching blow just to the on side. Caught in the crowd!"
6.3,"Santner to Rana, 1 run","round the wicket, full at the stumps, he leans forward and works across his front pad into square leg"
6.2,"Santner to Lynn, 1 run","full at the stumps, pushed down to long on"
6.1,"Santner to Lynn, no run","fired into the pitch back of a length, mistimed back to the bowler"
5.6,"Jadeja to Lynn, 1 run","pushed into the pads this time, flicked to deep square leg"

4.6,"Santner to Rana, no run","stays round the wicket, nicely bowled, slides across Rana and takes the outside edge towards short third man"
4.5,"Santner to Narine, OUT","taken at long-on! Spin does the trick. Was a full delivery, nicely in the arc for Narine, lofts it down the ground but without the distance"
4.4,"Santner to Lynn, 1 run",flicked down the ground to long-on
4.3,"Santner to Narine, 1 run","almost gets it through the off side, but mid-off gets across and intercepts this drive"
4.3,"Santner to Narine, 3 wide","poor ball, pushed well down the leg side, MS can't gather it and it scoots away towards fine leg"
4.2,"Santner to Narine, no run","full and straight, driven to mid-off"
4.1,"Santner to Narine, no run","round the wicket, fired across outside off, he swings and misses, rebounds off Dhoni's gloves"
3.6,"Thakur to Lynn, FOUR runs","terrific timing! A punchy drive at a full delivery, threads the gap through the covers no massive follow through this time"

3.2,"Thakur to Lynn, FOUR runs","crunched! He's drilled that straight, back through the bowler's hands I think, as Thakur goes full and straight. Lynn just swings through the line"

2.2,"Chahar to Lynn, SIX runs","that's huge! Charges down the pitch this time, it's another short ball, pulled well into the stands over deep midwicket"
2.1,"Chahar to Lynn, FOUR runs","makes good connection this time! Dropped in short, pull handsomely in front of square and wide of deep midwicket"
1.6,"Thakur to Lynn, 1 run","another short ball, 140kph, good wheels, and Lynn can't make connection with the pull, it just bobbles to the leg side off glove"

18.5,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run","length, and he drags this down to long on"
18.4,"Shami to Stoinis, FOUR runs","full ball, and he has dropped this down to long off. Interestingly, they kept mid off up for this ball, but Shami missed his mark with what I presume was meant to be a yorker. Critical boundary!"
18.3,"Shami to Stoinis, no run","length, and he punches this towards short cover"
18.2,"Shami to AB, 1 run","short, and he forces this towards point. Aerial, but safe"
18.1,"Shami to AB, 2 runs","full ball, and he whips this towards deep midwicket, and they pick up two. Was timed to perfection, in that it made the fielder run in hard"
17.6,"Tye to Stoinis, 2 runs","full, wide, and he has smacked this towards extra cover. The man at the fence, Mandeep, has to save this away to his left, and they get a comfortable couple"
17.5,"Tye to AB, 1 run","wide, full, and he smacks this towards cover. R Ashwin has hit the stumps straight from there!. But de Villiers is in, and it's also Tye's arm that dislodges the bails"
17.4,"Tye to AB, SIX runs","short, and AB has whacked this one inside out. Six!"
17.3,"Tye to Stoinis, 1 run","short, and he looks to go across the line. The ball goes high, and M Ashwin has grassed this! It was an ugly across-the-line swipe, and took the top edge and went towards deep midwicket. M Ashwin should have held on to this"
17.2,"Tye to Stoinis, FOUR runs","short, and he has cut this one past point. Uses the piece of the ball beautifully to guide it past the man at point! Back to back boundaries"
17.1,"Tye to Stoinis, FOUR runs","full, on his pads, and he flicks this away towards backward square leg. Terrific shot, as it eludes the fielder manning the fine leg boundary"
16.6,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run","length ball, bowled from wide of the crease, and he punches this to long off"
16.5,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 2 runs","short, and he punches this through short cover. Misfield from Sarfaraz there, and it allows them to come back for two"

16.3,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 2 runs","short, wide, and he cuts this towards backward point. Some work for the man at deep extra cover to do, and they come back for two"

15.4,"Shami to Stoinis, no run","short, and he defends this, off the ground as he plays it towards short midwicket"
15.3,"Shami to Kohli, OUT","short ball, and he has pulled this straight to M Ashwin! It was fast from Shami, faster off Kohli's bat as he looked for the deep midwicket fence, but M Ashwin was about 10-15 yards inside. Had to hold this over his head, and did well to hang on to what was a bullet shot. Is there a twist in the tale here?"
15.2,"Shami to AB, 1 run","swift ball, jags into him and he tries to get the whip through midwicket going. It hurries on to him, and he inside-edges this one into his body. They switch ends with some good running"

13.2,"Tye to AB, 1 run","length, slower ball, and he eases this towards long on"
13.1,"Tye to AB, 2 runs","full ball, on the pads, and he whips this away towards deep midwicket. Played softly enough to require Shami at backward square leg to run diagonally across to his left, and they take two"
12.6,"Sam Curran to AB, 1 run","fuller ball, on the pads, and he flicks this away towards deep midwicket"
12.5,"Sam Curran to AB, FOUR runs","length, and he gets inside the line of this, and scoops it over short fine leg. One bounce four. More of a swat away, down on one knee!"
12.4,"Sam Curran to Kohli, 1 run","length, on the pads, and he flicks this away, and Gayle dives away to his right at short fine leg. Keeps the scoring down to one!"

11.4,"Tye to Kohli, 2 runs","short, and he waits on this and flicks it away towards deep midwicket. They come through for two again, though the return had de Villiers scrambling. It would have been closer, had the throw at the non-striker's end been closer to the bowler"
11.3,"Tye to Kohli, FOUR runs","length, down the leg side, and he flicks this away. Fine leg is up inside the circle, and he places this well wide of deep backward square leg"
11.2,"Tye to Kohli, no run","length ball, and he pushes this towards the vacant short midwicket area, but Tye is quick to get to the ball this time to prevent any runs being taken"

10.6,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run","length, and he punches this towards long on, to bring up fifty. Points to the crest on his jersey as he soaks in the applause of the Mohali crowd. This has been a good, controlled innings from him"

5.6,"Ashwin to Kohli, no run","full on off stump, pushed into the covers"
5.5,"Ashwin to Kohli, FOUR runs",oh what a shot! Short of a length slider outside off. He shuffles and punches it wide of mid-on off the back foot. Deep midwicket sprints to his left and puts in a dive. Gets a hand on it but is not able to arrest his momentum. Pushes it into the boundary at long-on
5.4,"Ashwin to Kohli, FOUR runs","short and wide, reaches out this time and goes with the turn. Gets a nice little swing at this and gets it between point and backward point"
5.3,"Ashwin to Kohli, no run",nearly drags on a filthy short ball! Short and very very wide outside off. Looks to pull and gets an inside edge that smashes into his pads and trickles past leg stump

4.2,"Shami to AB, FOUR runs","past mid-off. Probably not the ideal connection on it, but there's bat speed on this sufficient to get it past the infield. The back foot punch is slightly off the inside part of the bat, but well wide of Ashwin"

3.3,"Ashwin to Kohli, FOUR runs","drilled past the bowler! Full outside off, gets to the pitch and just whips his wrists at this! So quick. Ashwin can barely get down as this races past the stumps"

0.2,"Sam Curran to Patel, 1 run","length and in at leg stump, flicked to fine leg"

19.6,"Siraj to Gayle, FOUR runs","he finishes at 99 not out! Near-perfect execution of the wide yorker from Siraj, but Gayle gets some bat on it and sends it flying towards backward point. It bounces on the way, though, and Gayle walks off with a wry grin. Well batted, boss!"
19.5,"Siraj to Gayle, no run","full, wide, and he misses! That was quick, and within the tramlines, and didn't give any space for Gayle to get under it. Tried to thwack it down the ground, but missed"

18.3,"Yadav to Mandeep, 1 run","yorker, and he digs this out towards extra cover"
18.3,"Yadav to Mandeep, 1 wide","full ball, but down the leg side. Mandeep was looking for the flick, but missed on contact. Called a wide"

18.1,"Yadav to Gayle, FOUR runs","full ball, and he has swung this towards deep midwicket. There's a fielder in that region, but he has placed it to the right, more in the region of wide long on. One bounce, four!"
17.6,"Saini to Mandeep, 2 runs","short, and he has gone for the pull again. It lands in empty spaces close to the deep midwicket. The ball stops enough and allows de Villiers to get to it"

17.1,"Saini to Gayle, no run","slower ball, full and angles across Gayle again. He leaves this one, just like the previous one, but this time there's no wide called"
17.1,"Saini to Gayle, 1 wide","tries a slower ball, across the batsman, and it's called a wide. Seemed to stay within the tramlines, but called against him"
16.6,"Siraj to Gayle, 1 run","full again, and he drills this back down the ground. Virat Kohli fields it well at long on and keeps the scoring down to just one"
16.5,"Siraj to Mandeep, 1 run","length, outside off, and he cracks a square drive, but gets it to backward point"
16.4,"Siraj to Gayle, 1 run","yorker, and he digs it out and gets it towards wide long on"

15.3,"Saini to Mandeep, 1 run","short, wide and he cuts this, but there's deep backward point in place for Mandeep"
15.2,"Saini to Gayle, 1 run","short ball, and he scoops this one towards square leg. It evades the man at square leg, and also doesn't carry to long leg. Good bowling again"
15.1,"Saini to Gayle, no run","short ball, lifting into Gayle as he moves away and tries to create some room for himself. That was brisk, as it seems to brush a bit of his shirt and go through to Patel"
14.6,"Chahal to Mandeep, no run","fuller ball, towards leg stump, and he looks to drive this to long off, but Chahal fields"

Length ball, dipping into a short of a length on a middle stump line, squares him up completely and takes the top of off stump. Mayank is on the back foot looking to close the face on this and he is dumbfounded. Superb, just superb from Chahal. Two wickets immediately after being hit for sixes. There's a reason he's the best legspinner in limited-overs cricket right now"

5.3,"Siraj to Gayle, FOUR runs","through the covers. Oh boy, looks like another long night for Siraj. Looks nervous already - third type of ball already. This is a slower one. It's short of a length and gives him time to back away and slap it"

4.6,"Yadav to Rahul, no run","dropped at extra cover by a diving AB de Villiers. Tough chance. Once again Rahul doesn't connect on the drive.

18.2,"Bumrah to Gowtham, 1 leg bye","141ks yorker from wide of the crease, Gowtham falls over. This yorker is just too good for him. But, this seems to be heading down the leg side. Not given, Rohit challenges the on-field not-out decision."
18.1,"Bumrah to Smith, OUT","Has Smith nicked off? The finger goes up and Smith walks off. Bumrah ventures wide of the crease, angles a length ball into Smith and then gets it to straighten away. Smith has a flat-footed waft and feathers it behind to Kishan"

16.2,"Archer to Pollard, OUT","Archer gets Pollard. Archer runs in hard, hits the deck harder, Gopal runs back from midwicket, gets into a side-on position in the outfield and takes this skier in the end. Pollard never really got going and Archer's pace is just too quick for him. 142.6ks, Pollard is late onto the pull. He can only skew it in the air, and Gopal does the rest. Gone for 6 off 12 balls"

7.5,"Chawla to S Dhawan, 1 run","length, angles away, and he plays it with soft hands towards point. There's a direct hit from the fielder there, but they had started early, and the non-striker had made his ground safely at the striker's end"

5.5,"Russell to Pant, no run","short, and he ducks under this one. Thought about guiding it over slip for a while, but lets it go"
5.4,"Russell to Iyer, OUT","short, and he flicks this away, and straight to Karthik. Iyer walks! It was down the leg side, and he literally would have taken a bit more bat to run it down to fine leg, possibly for four, but got a fine tickle on to it. Karthik takes his second catch with a good, swift movement to his left"
5.3,"Russell to S Dhawan, 1 run","length, slower, as it angles across him, and he drives this towards backward point"

3.1,"Russell to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","short of a length, on off stump, and he cuts this, and Krishna lets it through, fielding at a short third man position"
2.6,"Prasidh to Shaw, OUT","what a catch! Length ball angles in towards Shaw, and he gets the outside edge as Shaw looks to drive this from the crease, and it takes a big edge and flies away towards where first slip would have been. Karthik flies away to his right, and gets it within his mitts. Stupendous work, that should lift Kolkata Knight Riders after an expensive over from Prasidh Krishna!"
2.5,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, 1 run","fuller, outside off, and he clips this away towards backward point, where Robin Uthappa was moved to after the first two balls of this over"
2.4,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, SIX runs","short, and wide, and he has given it the full monty. Slashed over backward point, and all the way for six!"
2.3,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, no run","short, cuts back into him, and Karthik and the bowler go up in appeal for caught behind. It's been given not out, and they have reviewed this. The foot is fine, and it comes back into him, and bat and ball are quite close as the ball goes through after cutting him in half virtually. There's probably some part of the trouser that it has brushed, but has it also taken the bat or glove? This is a tricky one for the TV umpire Rod Tucker. Given not out"
2.2,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","advances down the pitch, Krishna throws it short and wide, and he slashes this over point. No fielder in the deep, and that means it's four on this really fast outfield"
2.1,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, SIX runs","short, and he guides this over the slips, and gets it fast enough to go over third man. Top shot, which will do his confidence a world of good"

19.2,"Paul to Brathwaite, OUT","length on middle, slower ball Brathwaite swings but the change in pace means he has to fetch it from well in front of his body, gets no power behind it and it's a simple catch down to deep midwicket"
19.1,"Paul to Chawla, 3 runs","full on off, Chawla goes big, doesn't time it, it goes high up in the air and hangs up there forever, two fielders were converging, in the end, nobody got there"

18.2,"Morris to Russell, OUT","full toss outside off, Russell slashes and slashes hard but it goes flat and hard straight down third-man's throat. Hard to imagine that such a dismissal could be planned but the Capitals will be too relieved to think about such things"

19.6,"Stokes to Santner, SIX runs","Santner finishes off in style What. A. Finish. CSK have won. They've stolen this. Amazing, amazing win. This was bowled full and outside off, Santner was probably expecting it, given that Stokes had been trying that, moved into position just enough to be able to extend his arms and loft it high and handsome over long-on. I repeat. What a win!"
19.6,"Stokes to Santner, 1 wide","And now that's been called a wide! Stokes went for the one wide outside off, and it is moving away a bit ends up outside the tram line!"
19.5,"Stokes to Santner, 2 runs",wide of off and Santner stretches out and tries to swat it straight but it bounces in front of long-on
19.4,"Stokes to Santner, 2 runs","another no-ball for height this time slower ball goes wrong ends up above waist height and Santner is able to shovel-flick it away. Okay scratch that, they have revoked that no-ball. And unprecedented - Dhoni is walking on the field to argue with the umpires He's arguing with them, Stokes is in the thick of it. Scenes! Scenes! Dhoni will earn himself a sanction. And CSK are going to be docked 'fairplay' points. The umpire had stuck his hand out, but the square leg umpire said that was not a no-ball"
19.3,"Stokes to Dhoni, OUT",yorked him Stokes nails the perfect ball at the right time. Tails in between bat and leg to shatter the stumps. Dhoni was looking to give himself room
19.2,"Stokes to Dhoni, 2 runs","slower ball, back of a length, Dhoni doesn't get hold of it properly, pulls it off the end of the bat past Stokes. Runs two"

18.6,"Archer to Dhoni, FOUR runs","oh that's unfortunate for Archer, inside edge off a yorker length ball that goes to the fine leg boundary. Much needed for CSK though. Dhoni wanted to shovel it to the leg side but ends up french cutting it. Still, magnificent by Archer - 1 for 19 in four overs"

17.6,"Stokes to Jadeja, 2 runs","yorker, another slower ball, no pace for Jadeja to work with, though he waits for it and drills it down the ground. Long-on runs around and fields"
17.5,"Stokes to Dhoni, 1 run","full on fifth stump line, slower ball, just pushed to mid-off. Dhoni had to adjust to it late, think he didn't read the slower one early"
17.4,"Stokes to Rayudu, OUT","brilliant catch by Shreyas running back at square leg Stokes continues with the short ball, Rayudu down the track and tries to swat it, cramped for room a bit and gets a top edge. Shreyas runs back, almost too far from the ball but holds on to it to his left"

16.4,"Archer to Dhoni, 1 leg bye","nasty bouncer. Quick and hostile on target, pinged Dhoni right on the helmet. He was too late to react or move out of the way, and it loops up to the keeper, they take a leg bye"

16.2,"Archer to Rayudu, 2 leg byes","ooh that's unfortunate for the bowler. Inch perfect yorker, with Rayudu giving himself room. It squirts off the inside edge past a diving Sanju. Tripathi runs around from third man to field it and keep it down to two runs"

15.1,"Gopal to Dhoni, no run","yorker, pushed back to the bowler. That was not a leg-break, seam up release!"
14.6,"Unadkat to Rayudu, FOUR runs",brings up fifty with a fierce pull to deep square leg. He wasn't happy with the refused single last ball and took his anger out on the ball. Not that short but he gets down low and swivels to connect with force. No chance for any fielder
14.5,"Unadkat to Rayudu, no run","keeps it back of a length again but follows Rayudu that time as he was giving himself room and coming down the track. Rayudu steers it to the right of point and wants a single, but Dhoni refuses. There was a single there"
14.4,"Unadkat to Rayudu, SIX runs","down the track to a back of length ball and Rayudu connects well with the pull, sends it over deep midwicket."
14.3,"Unadkat to Dhoni, 1 run","length ball, keeping it tight and within the stumps, Dhoni happy to just push it to mid-on and run"
14.2,"Unadkat to Rayudu, 1 run","slower ball on middle stump, almost a yorker. Clipped to deep square leg"
14.1,"Unadkat to Dhoni, 1 run","length ball going across  him, steers to short third man"
13.6,"Stokes to Rayudu, no run","brilliant fielding by Stokes full ball, driven back by Rayudu and this should be going past the bowler, but not when it's Stokes. He not only leaps to his left to field the ball but throws it back at the stumps in one fluid motion with a reverse flick. Rayudu had managed to scramble back though"
13.6,"Stokes to Rayudu, 1 wide",slower ball goes too far down leg and he'll have to re-bowl that
13.5,"Stokes to Rayudu, no run","great stop by Samson seemed to slip out of Stokes' hands a bit, quick full toss that Rayudu's drive got an under-edge to. Samson went to his right to stop it"
13.4,"Stokes to Dhoni, 1 run","fuller on off, tapped to long-on"
13.3,"Stokes to Rayudu, 1 leg bye","length ball, nipping in a bit. Rayudu was moving across, is hit on the pads and the ball rolls to square leg. Hit too high though, so Stokes' appeal in vain"
13.2,"Stokes to Rayudu, SIX runs","what a shot dances down the track while giving himself room, slower ball from Stokes, was rolling his fingers over it and Rayudu nails the drive over extra cover"
13.1,"Stokes to Dhoni, 1 run","digs it in short but going down leg, which lets Dhoni pull it down to deep square leg"
12.6,"Gopal to Dhoni, 1 run","tossed up fuller on the stumps, shovels it to long-on"
12.5,"Gopal to Dhoni, SIX runs","uncorked that one Shreyas thought the line wide of off was working so kept at it, but Dhoni simply went down on one knee and clubbed this well over long-on"
12.4,"Gopal to Dhoni, no run","quicker one, a bit shorter, Dhoni chops it to cover off the back foot"
12.3,"Gopal to Rayudu, 1 run","slightly short of length outside off, stroked to deep cover"
12.2,"Gopal to Dhoni, 1 run","goes wide of off stump that time, making Dhoni stretch for it. He taps it towards point"
12.1,"Gopal to Rayudu, 1 run","too short, sat up and deserved to be spanked to the boundary but it's Stokes at deep midwicket, and he's super quick to run to his left, gather the ball well inside the rope, lose balance, recover, and fire in a throw"
11.6,"Archer to Rayudu, 1 run","fuller, clipped to mid-on from the back foot"
11.5,"Archer to Dhoni, 1 run","short ball again, Dhoni goes on the back foot and pulls it to deep square"
11.4,"Archer to Rayudu, 1 run","length ball outside off, Rayudu gets close to it and steer it to third man"
11.3,"Archer to Rayudu, no run",
11.2,"Archer to Dhoni, 1 run","fuller, turned to midwicket's left"
11.1,"Archer to Dhoni, no run","run out chance missed What was Rayudu thinking there? Short ball outside off, Dhoni pushed it to Stokes at point. Rayudu charged down the pitch - unwise given how livewire Royals have been - and was more than halfway down before turning back. Stokes unleashed a throw but didn't hit the stumps"
10.6,"Parag to Rayudu, FOUR runs","and Rayudu gets into the act now, tossed up, too full and outside off. He gets the chance to extend his arms and drills it past the bowler and into the straight boundary"
10.5,"Parag to Dhoni, 1 run",drags it down short and Dhoni paddles it to short fine
10.4,"Parag to Dhoni, SIX runs",Dhoni power very full and Dhoni's perhaps decided that it's time the youngster is put under pressure. Slog-sweeps it from outside off to send it hard and flat to deep midwicket. The ball hits the boundary rope on the full
10.3,"Parag to Rayudu, 1 run","given some air, on a length, Rayudu pushes it to long-on off the front foot"
10.2,"Parag to Rayudu, no run","fuller, in the slot to drive and he does so crisply, but extra cover tumbles to his right to field"
10.1,"Parag to Rayudu, 2 runs","slightly short, pulled from outside off to between long-on and deep midwicket"
9.6,"Gopal to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, on the back foot to whip to deep midwicket"
9.5,"Gopal to Dhoni, 1 run","short at off stump, backs away and hammers this to long-off's right. Sends Rayudu back as he hares down for the second"
9.4,"Gopal to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length outside off, gets back and punches to long-off"
9.3,"Gopal to Dhoni, 1 run","short of a length in the corridor, chopped off the under-edge to point's right"
9.2,"Gopal to Dhoni, SIX runs","we can start now! Dhoni jumps down the pitch and sends Gopal a long, long way over long-on. 93 metres. Length ball, slider, and he doesn't allow it to do anything off the pitch"
9.1,"Gopal to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length on middle stump, punched uppishly to long-on off the back foot"
8.6,"Parag to Dhoni, no run","length at off stump, leans in and stabs to extra cover"

8.4,"Parag to Rayudu, 2 runs","length outside off, driven to long-off"
8.3,"Parag to Rayudu, 2 runs","in the air and safely wide of extra cover. That looked like it was bowled with the wrist, although gripped with two fingers. Sort of like Mujeeb. Long-off cleans up"
8.2,"Parag to Dhoni, 1 run","dropped short, 103kph, on off. Hurriedly pulled to deep square"
8.1,"Parag to Rayudu, 1 run","length on middle stump, driven on the rise to long-on"

6.6,"Parag to Dhoni, 2 runs","short of a length on middle, gets deep in the crease and taps this fine on its head. Long leg has a long way to run to his right"
6.5,"Parag to Dhoni, no run","full outside off, pushed to extra cover on the front foot"
6.4,"Parag to Dhoni, no run","floats away wide outside. The release is like Ashwing's away-floater, for those who have seen it. And it seems to be his stock ball. Dhoni beaten as he looks to poke at this"
6.3,"Parag to Dhoni, no run",tossed this one up. Full and just outside off Leans in and drives to extra cover
6.2,"Parag to Rayudu, 1 run","length at middle stump, gets deep and clips to deep midwicket"
6.1,"Parag to Rayudu, no run","short of a length just outside off, chopped to third man"
5.6,"Archer to Dhoni, no run",mean bouncer and Dhoni gets his head quickly out of the way. Samson has to jump to gather that
5.5,"Archer to Jadhav, OUT","get out of here Stokes you beauty! Leaps, flies, stretches I don't know what he does, but he has plucked this to his left with two hands at backward point! Unreal. This cut shot was travelling and he had milliseconds to time the dive, let alone getting his hands around it. Pure reflex. Short ball in the channel and Jadhav was cutting from under it as it got big on him. Archer's pace supported that shot though. Stokes wow. Kept his shape too as he came down to the floor to hold on"
5.4,"Archer to Jadhav, no run","short of a length in the corridor, defended into the covers off the back foot"
5.3,"Archer to Jadhav, no run","length in the corridor, defended off the back foot"
5.2,"Archer to Jadhav, no run",fizzes past the edge.  And Smith convinces Rahane to take the review. He's the only one who seemed to think this was out. Fiery short of a length ball from Archer in the corridor. Too quick for Jadhav's late cut indeed. Ball was well past him before the bat came down. The review's lost
5.1,"Archer to Jadhav, no run","length ball outside off, rising up, left alone"
4.6,"Kulkarni to Rayudu, 2 runs","length on leg stump, whipped to deep square's left"
4.5,"Kulkarni to Rayudu, SIX runs","steps out and sends it over the long-on boundary. Length on middle stump, got under it, didn't get all of it. But the swing was full and purposeful"

4.3,"Kulkarni to Rayudu, no run","short of a length on middle, flicked to midwicket's right. Smith leaps to stop it"

4.1,"Kulkarni to Jadhav, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, deflected into the leg side"
3.6,"Unadkat to du Plessis, OUT","picks out the fielder at deep midwicket! Spotted Samson asking Tripathi to move to his left after he'd pulled off that sliding stop a couple balls ago. And Faf has ended up hitting it straight there. Short of a length on middle stump, gets everything into this pull. It's not a small ground. Tripathi stays still and this dips on him. He takes it very very low in front of his eyes in the end. Not the ideal technique, but it's a good grab. Finally some joy for Unadkat. They've given him something following the short break, and he's given them good returns tonight"
3.5,"Unadkat to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length at off stump, dropped into the off side with soft hands"
3.4,"Unadkat to Rayudu, no run","past the edge. Length ball in the corridor, cuts across with the angle. Rayudu pokes on the front foot"
3.3,"Unadkat to du Plessis, 3 runs","in the air but safely over midwicket. Slower ball at a length outside off, clears the front leg and heaves at it. No control. Off the inside half and now we're seeing if Tripathi has touched the rope or not as he puts in a brilliant slide to his left, having run from deep square. It looks like he's just managed it too. And the infielder had tracked back to pick up his throw. Brilliant. The crowd loves this"
3.2,"Unadkat to Rayudu, 1 run","length just outside off, punched firmly to mid-off and just manages to make his ground at the other end as Royals get another direct-hit in"

1.6,"Unadkat to du Plessis, no run","short of a length in the corridor, defended into the off side"
1.5,"Unadkat to Raina, OUT","direct-hit at the non-striker's end! Raina could be gone here. He was ball-watching! Yes, that's out. This is poor from Raina. Flicks a length ball to short fine and watches the ball. Briefly looks to see if his partner is running and he is. Then, from there, for some reason, he decides to ball-watch again! Casual steps halfway down the pitch and then he tries to sprint. Those yards cost him in the end as Archer smashes the stumps down"
1.4,"Unadkat to Raina, FOUR runs","exposes the stumps and slaps it uppishly through the covers. Length on middle, plenty of risk and not full control, but that is just Raina"
1.3,"Unadkat to du Plessis, 1 run","length on leg stump, looks to flick, gets it into the leg side"
1.2,"Unadkat to du Plessis, no run","past the edge. Length ball in the corridor, goes on with the angle. Skids quickly and Faf is beaten on the late cut"

0.4,"Kulkarni to Watson, OUT","got him! Dream ball from Kulkarni! Outswinger - not a big one, just enough to beat the bat as Watson looks to flick this from a middle and leg line. Climbs up and tonks middle. Watson completely out of shape"

0.2,"Kulkarni to Watson, no run","length on middle stump, defended to mid-on off the back foot"

19.6,"Thakur to Archer, 1 run","pacy yorker to finish, he goes deep in his crease but can only stroke it to cover"
19.5,"Thakur to Archer, FOUR runs",too short and Archer moves inside the line to pull this over short fine leg for another boundary. Royals finishing with a flourish here
19.4,"Thakur to Gopal, 1 run","digs this in short, and Shreyas pulls it nicely but there is a deep square leg so only a single"
19.3,"Thakur to Gopal, SIX runs","shot! Shreyas is turning it on here. Stays still in his crease that time, clears his front leg again and smokes this full delivery over long-off. Sweetly timed"
19.2,"Thakur to Gopal, FOUR runs",smears this straight down the ground with a horizontal bat. Length ball and he cleared his front leg to swat it over the bowler's head and straight
19.1,"Thakur to Gopal, 2 runs","nicely connected and nicely fielded by Santner, running to his right from the cover boundary. Full outside off, Shreyas gives himself room again and flays it over extra cover, but Santner does well to tumble and save the boundary"
18.6,"Chahar to Gopal, 1 run","manufactures an upper cut to a slower bouncer, adjusting to the pace a bit late but sending it over Dhoni. No force on that shot so fine leg can come around and collect"
18.5,"Chahar to Gopal, FOUR runs","slower ball, he didn't get the timing quite perfect on it, but manages to just clear the long-off boundary. Scratch that, it bounced just inside the rope. Outside off, full and he was giving himself room ends up not getting it off the middle but no fielder at long-off, so he gets runs for it"
18.4,"Chahar to Archer, 1 run","pulled nicely, but there is a sweeper back at deep midwicket. Short ball, and Jofra connects well from outside off"
18.3,"Chahar to Gopal, 1 run","fullish on the stumps, turned to deep square leg. Popped it in the air, but the fielder was deep so it's safe"
18.2,"Chahar to Stokes, OUT","castled him Chahar continues to show he can bowl at the death too, he's not a one-trick, only Powerplay pony. Knuckle ball from around the wicket, on a length on the stumps. Stokes gave himself room and was looking for the big heave over cow corner. He misses, Chahar hits."
18.1,"Chahar to Archer, 1 run","some swing away from the right hander, but well wide of off, and Archer frees his arms to drive it hard, but straight to long off"

17.4,"Thakur to Archer, 1 run","length ball outside off, steered away"
17.3,"Thakur to Stokes, 1 run","too full, outside off, stroked to deep cover. They settle for the single"
17.2,"Thakur to Stokes, 2 runs",picked up off his toes and smashed back past the bowler but brilliant work by Faf who sprints from long on and dives to save this from going into the boundary
17.1,"Thakur to Stokes, 2 runs","makes room and slaps this past point. Another run out opportunity, with Archer running sloppily. but Shardul was sloppy to collect it too, though it wasn't the easiest take on the half-volley. but Archer was slow to respond to the second run, though he should have been looking for it to get Stokes on strike"

16.1,"Jadeja to Archer, no run","length ball outside off, pushed to mid off"
15.6,"Tahir to Stokes, 2 runs","this looks close, Archer could be run out at the non striker's end going for the second But he's just made it. Relief for Rajasthan. this was a full toss outside off and Stokes stroked it past the in-field. Called for two, there was a moment of hesitation between the two before they ran for it. The throw was flat, but a little wide of the stumps and by the time Tahir could gather it and break the stumps, Jofra had just about made his ground"
15.5,"Tahir to Archer, 1 run","length ball, spinning away from him, wanted to turn it to leg but gets a leading edge to point"
15.4,"Tahir to Stokes, 1 run",clipped off his toes to midwicket

15.1,"Tahir to Stokes, 1 run","another risky-looking quick single. Googly on leg stump, pushed to mid-off who ran in and had a shy at the stumps, just missed. Would have been close"

14.3,"Thakur to Stokes, 2 runs","fuller on the stumps, pushed to long on's left, but not hit too hard. They spot the opportunity for a second and run hard to take it"

13.3,"Tahir to Parag, FOUR runs","what a strange ssequence stopped on him a bit, he was very late on that, ends up flat batting it straight back. Popped in the air and over Tahir's head, didn't look it was timed well enough to have legs on it, but ends up beating a diving effort by long-off"

10.5,"Jadeja to Smith, OUT","swept straight to deep midwicket this 'attack attack' policy is good in theory, but Royals haven't executed it well enough. This was full enough to slog-sweep, and Smith connected well too, but hit it straight down the throat of the fielder"

Royals not used to all-out attacking, which takes some time to implement. Santner is rewarded for that slow pace again. Leg stump line, at a length. Wants to sweep but he's not to the pitch of it. Gets big on him and it pings off the top edge. Ball bounces off Shorey's body a couple of times as he tries to lose the momentum from the sprint and get his hands in order. Holds on and breathes easy at the end"

4.1,"Chahar to Samson, 1 run","runs it down to a fine third man. Length in the corridor, forward and opens the face late as this angles in"
3.6,"Thakur to Samson, 1 run","length at middle stump, pulled off the front foot to long leg"
3.5,"Thakur to Samson, no run",
3.4,"Thakur to Buttler, OUT","taken by extra cover! Buttler loses his shape and skies an easy one for Rayudu! Thakur wins the battle. Short of a length ball, he gets on the back foot and looks to punch it aerially, but it seems he's too early on it and ends up getting a little under it. Was looking good, had 12 in the over, he won't be pleased with the way he's gone"
3.3,"Thakur to Buttler, FOUR runs",three in three as he gets bat on this short ball down leg side. Gets it fine
3.2,"Thakur to Buttler, FOUR runs",between straight-ish extra cover and mid-off. A field set put in place just to stop these kind of shot. He's in some mood today. Stands tall and hammers this length ball on the rise
3.1,"Thakur to Buttler, FOUR runs","past Chahar's dive to the left at fine leg. He seems to have jammed his left knee and gone off the field in that corner. Short ball on middle stump, hooked into the turf"
2.6,"Chahar to Samson, FOUR runs","oh welcome back! Straight into the poetry, is Samson. Short ball up at off stump and he's got the body in perfect position -  eyes above the ball, base firm - and hooked this along the floor to get this blazing to long leg's left"
2.5,"Chahar to Rahane, OUT","Dhoni has reviewed the lbw appeal and based on the TV timer, it's a second late seemed to me like it was a second after the timer had hit zero. But it stands, say the umpires.. He wasn't convinced and the bowler talked him into it. Rahane was looking to flick this length ball over the leg side and was struck on the knee flap in front of middle and leg. Not a big stride and it's hitting leg stump! Middle of leg stump. That kept a little low and it was a good call to review it. Rahane is gone"
2.4,"Chahar to Buttler, 1 run","slower ball outside off, good length. Makes room and looks to go over cover. Gets it off the toe-end to long-on"
2.3,"Chahar to Rahane, 1 run",leading edge as he walks down and closes the face at this length ball outside off. Single to mid-off's left
2.2,"Chahar to Rahane, FOUR runs",shot! Length and not rising in the corridor. Rahane on top of it and getting the weight slightly onto the back foot to get this between point and cover

1.6,"Santner to Rahane, 1 run","length on leg stump, hurriedly nudged into the leg side with soft hands"

1.5,"Santner to Rahane, 5 wide","full and down leg side, looks to sweep, can't get bat. And it nutmegs Dhoni as well"
1.4,"Santner to Rahane, FOUR runs","over extra this time. Length outside off, dips and beats Rahane in flight. But he's down the track and he goes through with the shot. Inside-out, and beats long-off's sprint to the left"
1.3,"Santner to Rahane, FOUR runs","nicely chipped wide of mid-on. Length, flat at off stump. Steps out and short-arm punches this between midwicket and mid-on"
1.2,"Santner to Rahane, no run",length and slanted in at off stump. Plants the front leg across and flicks to midwicket
1.1,"Santner to Rahane, no run","length on off stump, driven back down the pitch"
0.6,"Chahar to Buttler, no run","length and cutting in from outside off, shuffles and looks to flick. Cops it on the thigh guard"
0.5,"Chahar to Buttler, SIX runs","and now he stays back and spanks it straight over him! This is quality from Buttler. Made Chahar bowl shorter by jumping down twice, and now he just sits deep, and whacks it straight from an off stump line"
0.4,"Chahar to Buttler, no run",lbw appeal but Buttler is well down the track to try and flick this from middle stump. Hits him on the thigh too
0.3,"Chahar to Buttler, FOUR runs","length on middle stump, shuffles and whips it to the midwicket boundary. Manufactured out of nothing with his lovely feet"
0.2,"Chahar to Buttler, no run","length on middle stump, angled in. Tapped to mid-on on the rise"

19.6,"Rajpoot to Joseph, 2 runs","full toss on middle pushed down the ground, past the bowler, and the long-on can't get around it in time to stop them from turning for the second.

19.5,"Rajpoot to Chahar, 1 run","full toss on middle, swung away to deep midwicket but only a single"
19.4,"Rajpoot to Joseph, 1 run","yorker on off, squeezed away to long-on and they all they get is one"
19.3,"Rajpoot to Joseph, no run","full toss on middle, the only thing in its favour is that it is fast and straight and Joseph can only pat it back to the bowler"
19.2,"Rajpoot to Pollard, OUT","short ball outside off and do we have a twists here? Ankit Rajpoot, who looked to have lost the match for his team for all money has had Pollard miscue the pull shot straight to deep midwicket. It was a good short ball, well outside off which meant Pollard had to drag it around and couldn't time or place it well enough"
19.1,"Rajpoot to Pollard, FOUR runs","full toss and now the match is in Mumbai's pocket. flicked away down to fine leg, it was an absolute freebie"
19.1,"Rajpoot to Pollard, (no ball) SIX runs","full toss on the pads and that's into the stand over deep squareleg, and what's more Ankit Rajpoot, who had been off the field since completing his previous spell has overstepped and it's a free hit"

18.5,"Sam Curran to Pollard, 1 run","yorker outside off, finally finds the the spot and squeezed away to deep cover, this time Pollard takes one"
18.4,"Sam Curran to Pollard, SIX runs","length on middle again and Pollard is not going to miss out on these. Just a flick of the wrists carries it all the way, deep into the upper tier of the stand at long-on"
18.3,"Sam Curran to Pollard, SIX runs","length outside off, poor delivery, a gift for Pollard given the mood he is in and accepts it gleefully! He has swatted this flat and hard over long-off"
18.2,"Sam Curran to Pollard, no run","full outside off, Pollard hammers it to deep extra cover again, doesn't time it as well and straight to the man, refuses the single"
18.1,"Sam Curran to Pollard, FOUR runs","full outside off, tries to keep it away from Pollard but he's found the middle of the bat through the covers and the boundary"
17.6,"Shami to Joseph, no run","full toss on middle, pushed to deep cover but Pollard refuses the single to have strike for the next over"
17.5,"Shami to Joseph, 2 runs","length on middle, slower ball, not picked and swung away to the leg side, not timed perfectly but the lack of power as it trickles away to long-on allows two"
17.4,"Shami to Joseph, FOUR runs","full outside off and Joseph pierces the off side field with a swat, gets it just wide of mid-off and once it beat him it was always four"
17.3,"Shami to Joseph, no run","short ball, well directed, fast and accurate, Joseph swings and misses"
17.2,"Shami to Pollard, 1 run","length outside off and swatted past the bowler, taking Shami's hand on the way, well stopped at long-off to keep it to one"

16.6,"Sam Curran to Pollard, SIX runs","full toss and was it a no-ball? No, not high enough but it certainly went high enough and importantly far enough, swung away deep into the stands over deep squareleg to bring up his fifty and keep his team very much in the hunt"
16.5,"Sam Curran to Pollard, no run","yorker outside off, away from Pollard's reach and there's some respite for Curran against Pollard"
16.4,"Sam Curran to Joseph, 1 run","yorker outside off, squeezes it out to third-man to turn the strike to Pollard"

16.2,"Sam Curran to Pollard, 1 run",
16.1,"Sam Curran to Pollard, SIX runs","full on off and Pollard is enjoying taking Curran on. In the slot under his bat, toe-ends it slightly but hits it flat and down the ground for six"
15.6,"Shami to Joseph, no run","length and angled in, cramping him for room and cuts him half"
15.5,"Shami to Joseph, FOUR runs","short ball, hurries onto him as he goes for the pull, the fielder at fine leg has a chance to his left, makes good ground and times his dive well but spills it as he lands"
15.4,"Shami to Krunal, OUT","slower ball on off, Krunal doesn't pick it, is through the drive early and chips a catch to extra cover. What a match Shami is having. Struck with the new ball and is now breaking the back of this chase"

14.2,"Viljoen to Pandya, 1 run","full outside off, swerved away a little from Hardik, drilled to deep extra cover for one"
14.1,"Viljoen to Pandya, 2 runs","full outside off, Hardik was already making room so has to reach for it with his hands, almost over balances as he does so but manages to clear extra cover"
13.6,"Ashwin to Pollard, 2 runs","length on middle, Pollard swings too early this time but an inside edge towards fine-leg earns him another couple"
13.5,"Ashwin to Pollard, SIX runs",length on middle and that's merely an extension of defence but Pollard has timed it soo well that it goes sailing down the ground and lands right on the sight screen
13.4,"Ashwin to Pollard, SIX runs","Pollard makes room, Ashwin slows it up and pushes it wide, but he still manages to get enough on it as he swings towards long-on and that's another six for Pollard"

11.6,"Sam Curran to Pollard, OUT","that's brilliant from Curran! After being walloped by Pollard, bowls a full one on the pads, Pollard misses the flick and is struck on the pad, the ball trickles towards the bowler and Ishan Kishan takes off for a suicidal single at the non striker but Curran still has to change direction in his follow through, pick the ball up, turn and throw accurately in one motion and he does all of that with great precision to give the visitors more breathing space"
11.5,"Sam Curran to Pollard, SIX runs","full on middle, right under Pollard's bat, right where he wants it and he is bringing Mumbai back into the contest. Hammered down the ground for another flat six"

11.1,"Sam Curran to Ishan, 1 run",
10.6,"Ashwin to Pollard, SIX runs","flat and short on middle, Pollard rocks back and lifts it straight down the ground, the long-on briefly thinks he is in with a chance but there's too much power behind the stroke for the fielder to even keep it in play"

9.2,"Viljoen to Pollard, no run",has he edged that?
9.1,"Viljoen to Pollard, no run","bouncer right up at Pollard's throat, which takes some effort. Pollard leaps off the turf and drops this into te pitch"
8.6,"Ashwin to Ishan, no run","full and flat at off stump, driven back to the bowler"
8.5,"Ashwin to de Kock, OUT","Miller does it perfectly this time! A top-quality sliding catch, running to his left from long-off. It's a loopy length ball outside off, he steps out and doesn't get to the pitch. Goes through with the loft anyway. It's flat and to Miller's left. He runs IN and also to his left and as he's sliding, he gets in the reverse-cup to hold on. Lovely."
8.4,"Ashwin to Pollard, 1 run","carrom ball at a length outside off, punched on the rise to long-off"
8.3,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","length on leg stump, tucked to deep square off the back foot"

7.4,"Sam Curran to Yadav, OUT","flicked straight to deep square! Moises Henriques, substitute fielder, is in at the boundary so he is made to leap at this. To his credit, he does it perfectly. It was a sensational shot, mind you, right off the middle, a flick picked up from well outside off stump to a length ball that was cutting away from him. But he has to go"
7.3,"Sam Curran to de Kock, 1 run","yorker at off stump, looks to drive through cover, gets it off the inside half out to deep square"

7.1,"Sam Curran to de Kock, 1 run","short in the corridor, opens the face and chops to third man's left"
6.6,"Ashwin to Yadav, no run",falls short of Ashwin. Short of a length and looks like a carrom ball. Stops on SKY who looks to force it down the ground off the back foot. It stops on him. He chips it back at the bowler who doesn't have the time to lunge forward

5.2,"Viljoen to Yadav, FOUR runs","oh shot! He looked to be in trouble as he crouched at this short ball, but he's kept his eyes on the ball and caressed this past short fine with a hook. From outside off. Those hands of his, they open up a lot of the ground"

4.2,"Rajpoot to Yadav, no run","dropped! Miller has completely mistimed his jump! At backward point. Short of a length  in the corridor. Looks to punch through cover. Thick outside edge. He jumps very very early and awkwardly sticks out one hand, his left, up above his shoulder and allows this to drop to the floor"
4.1,"Rajpoot to Yadav, FOUR runs","class. Among the best set of wrists meet this short ball outside off. Slanting in at the batsman, and sliced neatly to third man's right"
3.6,"Shami to de Kock, no run",yorker nailed at an off stump line. QDK has to bring his bat down quickly to keep this out
3.5,"Shami to Yadav, 1 run","length in the corridor, runs it down to third man with the pace"
3.4,"Shami to Lad, OUT","takes leg stump! Not a natural in this format or in this position, Lad, and the pressure makes him walk across the stumps and expose them. It's an overpitched ball, one he might have flicked, but he has to sort of reach out and fish at this. Shami is quick. Shami hits the stumps."
3.3,"Shami to Lad, no run",short of square leg again. Length ball. Keeps hurrying him and cramping him. That's the plan. Can't get the pull away

15.4,"Krunal to Nair, 2 runs","full toss on middle, Nair swings it away through the leg side and to the left of deep midwicket for two. Didn't time that at all"
15.3,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","full toss, quicker one outside off, hammered along the ground to deep cover"
15.2,"Krunal to Nair, 1 run","length, angled in, Nair makes room and lofts him inside out but straight to deep cover on the bounce"
15.1,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","full on middle, Rahul turns the face too early and gets a leading edge that trickles away to point"
14.6,"Pandya to Miller, OUT","edged and gone! Mumbai are clawing back into this game. It was full outside off, Miller threw his hands at it to blast it through the off side but only managed a healthy edge back to the keeper"
14.6,"Pandya to Miller, 1 wide",full outside off but too wide and Miller lets it through to the keeper
14.5,"Pandya to Miller, FOUR runs","slower ball full outside off, Miller has a slash and just bisects short third-man and point for four"
14.4,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 run","short outside off, off cutter, Rahul looks to cut but doesn't time and gets a single as it trickles away towards point"
14.3,"Pandya to Miller, 1 run","full toss on middle, pushed to long-on"
14.2,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 run","full on middle, pushed to long-on"
14.1,"Pandya to Rahul, 2 runs","full outside off, Rahul has to reach for it with his hands but manages to get enough elevation to clear cover and long-off has to cover a considerable distance to his left to cut that off and keep it to two"
13.6,"Chahar to Miller, no run","that was close again! The leggie is really troubling Miller. Changes his pace, slows it up, keeps it on a length, Miller goes back again, but this one turns sharply back into him and he nearly chops it back on the stumps, saved by his pad that came in the way. Brilliant follow up over after Gayle's wicket"
13.5,"Chahar to Miller, no run","quicker one on middle, Miller plays back again and gets his bat down on it just in the nick of time"
13.4,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","full on middle, straighter one, Rahul skips down the wicket and has a swing but only gets a thick inside edge, along the ground to deep squareleg"
13.3,"Chahar to Rahul, 2 runs","length on off, slight turn away gives Rahul room to cut it away towards deep point for a couple"
13.2,"Chahar to Miller, 1 run","length on middle, stays back and pushes it to long-on. Miller doesn't seem to know which way it's turning, is trying to read him from the pitch"
13.1,"Chahar to Miller, no run","length on middle, hurries onto Miller, who defends late and nearly chops it back on to the stumps"
12.6,"Behrendorff to Miller, 1 run","length on off, Miller shuffles across and clips away it away towards deep midwicket for one"
12.5,"Behrendorff to Gayle, OUT","finally, Mumbai break a very very threatening stand! What's more, it's Gayle, the scalp they'd arguably value more even though Rahul has looked pretty good himself. They have an opening now. It was length on middle, Gayle swung hard but the bat seemed to turn in his hands as he made contact with the ball, it was nothing more than a thick inside edge, went flat and hard towards deep midwicket, where he was caught well by the fielder who had dive forward"
12.4,"Behrendorff to Rahul, 1 run","full outside off, pushed to cover, chance of a run-out as Rahul takes off but Pollard misses at the non striker's end and that's Rahul's fifty"
12.3,"Behrendorff to Rahul, no run","length drifting down the leg side, Rahul only manages a glove to it on the way to the keeper. Missed out there"
12.2,"Behrendorff to Gayle, 1 run","full on off, almost a yorker, Gayle can't slog it away, gets a thick inside edge down to long-on"
12.1,"Behrendorff to Rahul, 1 run","full on the pads, clipped away to short fine-leg's left for one"
11.6,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked to deep square's left"

11.4,"Chahar to Rahul, 2 runs","length on off stump, opens the face and slices to sweeper's left"
11.3,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","length just outside off, steps out and is beaten in flight. Nicely bowled. Pokes on the up to extra cover"
11.2,"Chahar to Gayle, 1 run","length outside off, chopped to point's left"
11.1,"Chahar to Gayle, SIX runs","boom! Straight over the bowler. Length outside off, big stride, big swing you know how it goes, right?"
10.6,"Krunal to Rahul, no run","pushed through fast outside off, swipes and misses"
10.5,"Krunal to Rahul, no run","low full toss at leg stump, looks for the paddle sweep, goes too soon. It knocks the toe-end"
10.4,"Krunal to Rahul, 2 runs","in the air but lands safely between sweeper and long-off who are converging on this. Length ball, steps out and is beaten in flight. Sliced high"
10.3,"Krunal to Gayle, 1 run","full on off stump, driven along the floor to mid-off"
10.2,"Krunal to Gayle, SIX runs",fifty! Sixth six to bring it up. Krunal drops it short from around the wicket. Gayle probably shakes his head before slapping it over long-on
10.1,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","length on middle stump, backs away and punches to sweeper cover"
9.6,"Chahar to Gayle, SIX runs","pumped over long-off! He had only one run off eight balls against Chahar, but this is the first one that lands in his driving arc and he capitalises. Clean swing and it's gone a long way"
9.5,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","beaten by a googly. Length outside off, leans in and pokes on the front foot. Fizzes past the blade"
9.4,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","length on leg stump, looks for the paddle sweep, cops it on the pad outside the line of leg stump"
9.3,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","short of a length and in at leg stump, backs away and looks to pull. Cops it on the pad"
9.2,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","googly, short of a length just outside off. Hurriedly chopped to point"
9.1,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","full and just outside off, looks for the reverse sweep and is beaten. QDK doesn't gather though"
8.6,"Pandya to Gayle, no run","short and wide outside off, cut to point"
8.5,"Pandya to Gayle, no run","short and climbing away outside off, left alone. Just inside the wide marker this time"
8.5,"Pandya to Gayle, 1 wide",full and very very wide outside off. Left alone
8.4,"Pandya to Gayle, FOUR runs","carted to the wide long-off boundary! This is not a great length at his pace - offcutter, dug in short outside off. Clears the front foot and flat-bats it through the off side. Extra cover is back and so is long-off, but this goes between them"
8.4,"Pandya to Gayle, 1 wide","length ball wide outside off, left alone"
8.3,"Pandya to Gayle, FOUR runs","get out of the way! Length ball at middle stump, lines it up and drills it past Pandya's left shin. His hands come up, and he will probably admit they came up in self defense"
8.2,"Pandya to Gayle, SIX runs","85 metres in the deep backward square direction. Short ball, not troubling Gayle who gets his weight into the off side and spanks it with a flat bat"
8.1,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 run","length at off stump, dropped into the off side with soft hands"
7.6,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","thick edge to backward point. Googly, thrown out wide outside off. Looks to drive but isn't to the pitch"
7.5,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","length on leg stump, cops it on the pad as he looks to flick"
7.4,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","full outside off, driven with the turn to sweeper cover's right"
7.3,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR runs","bisects deep midwicket and long-on. Doesn't allow this to turn past him, gets a big stride in and flicks firmly against the turn"
7.2,"Chahar to Gayle, 1 run","length outside off, punched to long-off"
7.1,"Chahar to Gayle, no run","length down leg side, looks to paddle and miscues. It trickles to short fine"
6.6,"Joseph to Gayle, 1 run","short of a length at middle stump, makes room, opens the face and pushes this to extra cover who gets a direct hit in. No appeal, no third umpire"
6.5,"Joseph to Rahul, 1 run","length on middle stump, driven on the rise to long-on"
6.4,"Joseph to Rahul, no run","length on leg stump, flicked to midwicket's right. A diving stop there"
6.3,"Joseph to Rahul, FOUR runs","chipped over mid-off. Offcutter, rising up from a length outside off. It's quite big on him but he goes on the rise and doesn't check the shot. Carries on and gets the reward"
6.2,"Joseph to Rahul, SIX runs","oh so good. Short ball in the corridor, gets on the back foot, holds his position and launches this pull over the midwicket boundary. Such a smooth movement that, all along"
6.1,"Joseph to Rahul, no run","short of a length on off stump, defended towards point off the back foot"
6.1,"Joseph to Rahul, 1 wide","oerpitched and down leg side, can't connect on the flick"
5.6,"Bumrah to Gayle, no run",short of a length and climbing steeply across off stump. Gets the bat out of the way to let this go
5.5,"Bumrah to Rahul, 1 run","length in the corridor, soft hands as he gets this down to third man"
5.4,"Bumrah to Rahul, FOUR runs",lovely. This is a slower ball so he's done superbly to pick and punch off the back foot. A tad too short from Bumrah and he gets the weight transfer onto the back toe and gets the elbow high to pierce the infield
5.3,"Bumrah to Gayle, 1 run",short and up at the hips. Gets on his toes and deflects it past short fine off the thigh guard
5.2,"Bumrah to Gayle, no run",length and across the corridor. Changes his mind late and lets this go
5.1,"Bumrah to Rahul, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked to midwicket's right"
4.6,"Behrendorff to Gayle, SIX runs","easy little pick-up. Too easy for Gayle. Offcutter, full and just outside off. He's picked it and he's brought that bat in a straight path from under it to casually pick up six over the straight boundary"
4.5,"Behrendorff to Gayle, FOUR runs","over the off side. Slower ball, dropped short of a length and wide outside off. Adjusts after being beaten off the pitch. Slices it over point and gets it into the boundary padding on the bounce"
4.4,"Behrendorff to Gayle, no run","slower ball at a length on middle stump, backs away and taps into the off side on the rise"
4.3,"Behrendorff to Gayle, SIX runs","and now to long-on's left! Length at off stump, feet out of the way, lot of swinging room and swing he does - off the inside half with the slog"
4.2,"Behrendorff to Gayle, SIX runs","clears the straight boundary with some force! Length ball in the corridor, front foot into the leg side and drilled flat over to long-on's right"
4.1,"Behrendorff to Rahul, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked to deep square's left"
3.6,"Joseph to Rahul, 1 run","length in the corridor, dropped into the covers with soft hands"
3.5,"Joseph to Rahul, SIX runs","picks it up from middle and gets this a few metres over the long leg boundary. Missed the timing a bit and got more elevation than distance on this, but a classy looking shot nonetheless. Length on middle, leaned in and just cocked the wrists from underneath this"
3.4,"Joseph to Gayle, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked straight to mid-on"
3.3,"Joseph to Gayle, no run","past the off stump after missing the inside edge. Length ball slanted across off stump, he gets the front leg into the leg side and heaves hard at this but the ball whistles past the bat"
3.2,"Joseph to Rahul, 1 run","full on middle stump, watchfully flicked to mid-on's right"
3.1,"Joseph to Rahul, no run","length ball just outside off, solidly behind the line to defend on the back foot"

2.3,"Behrendorff to Rahul, no run","length at off stump, closes the face for the flick, gets a leading edge towards mid-off"
2.2,"Behrendorff to Rahul, no run","length just outside off, closes the face and punches to mid-on"
2.1,"Behrendorff to Rahul, FOUR runs","shot. Length ball just outside off, gets on top of the bounce and punches it between cover and cover point. Lovely balance"
1.6,"Bumrah to Gayle, no run",fiery. Short of a length and steep in the corridor. Gayles drops his arms and gets the bat into the leg side to let this pass
1.5,"Bumrah to Gayle, no run",past the edge. Full and fast and pushed across the corridor. Gayles jams the bat into the ground well after the ball has climbed into the keeper's gloves
1.4,"Bumrah to Rahul, 1 run","squares him up in the corridor. Short of a length, he looks to defend and does well to play with soft hands as this pings to third man off the outside edge"
1.3,"Bumrah to Gayle, 1 run",first runs off the thick outside edge. Gayle hangs the bat inside the line at this length ball and gets a run at third man
1.2,"Bumrah to Rahul, 1 run","length on middle stump, tapped on the rise to mid-on"
1.1,"Bumrah to Rahul, no run","yorker length just outside off, jams the bat down on this and finds cover point"
0.6,"Behrendorff to Gayle, no run","full on off, Gayle stays rooted to the crease and appears to be slightly late on it but gets his bat down just in time and pats it back to the bowler"
0.5,"Behrendorff to Rahul, 1 run","length outside off, backs away a little and guides it to third-man. Tentative stroke again but managed to get it wide enough of the only slip in place"
0.4,"Behrendorff to Rahul, no run","length and angled away, rahul fishes at it with his hands, the slight movement away and extra bounce beats him on the outside edge again"
0.3,"Behrendorff to Rahul, no run","length on off, Rahul waits for it to come to him and defends it right under his eyes to point"
0.2,"Behrendorff to Rahul, no run","full outside off, Rahul comes forward again, a better stride but inside edges it back onto his pad"
0.1,"Behrendorff to Rahul, no run","length outside off, draws Rahul forward who has a tentative poke, unsure of whether it would swing back in or go away with the angle, it just leaves him slightly and beats the outside edge"
17.3,"Narine to du Plessis, 5 wide","and this one is definitely turning past leg, also both of DK's legs. Pitches outside leg, turns a long way down and trickles towards the CSK dugout"
17.2,"Narine to du Plessis, no run",lbw shout as this rips back in sharply. Faf with the front leg planted across for a flick. That's turning past leg stump
17.1,"Narine to Jadhav, 1 run",length and turning into middle stump. Stays deep in the crease and pushes to extra cover's left
16.6,"Gurney to Jadhav, 1 run","full on leg stump, leans in for the flick to deep backward square"
16.5,"Gurney to du Plessis, 1 run","slower ball at middle stump, looks to lift it over the off side, gets it off the inside half to deep square"
16.4,"Gurney to du Plessis, FOUR runs",nicely done. Been a neat little innings of class from Faf tonight. Short ball down leg side. Allows it to skid on and helps it past short fine with a pull
16.3,"Gurney to du Plessis, FOUR runs","scythes it over extra cover. Low full toss just outside off, stays inside the line, opens the face late and gets it to the boundary. That ball probably explains why Gurney hasn't bowled a lot tonight - he's having trouble gripping it"
16.3,"Gurney to Jadhav, (no ball) 1 run","length at leg stump, looks to flick and cops it on the pad off the inside edge. They steal a single.It's a massive no-ball"
16.2,"Gurney to Jadhav, no run",slower short ball headed down leg. Looks for the pull and is through it early. Cops it on the forearm
16.1,"Gurney to Jadhav, no run","offcutter at a length on off stump, from around the wicket. Defended into the covers"
15.6,"Prasidh to du Plessis, 2 runs","leading edge but it results in two. Length at off stump, defends inside the line and this pings off the outer part of the bat, past point"
15.5,"Prasidh to du Plessis, no run","full on off stump, driven firmly back down the pitch and at the bowler"
15.4,"Prasidh to du Plessis, 2 runs","low full toss just outside off, drives it to sweeper's right"
15.3,"Prasidh to du Plessis, 2 runs",nicely timed but sweeper cover cleans up to his left. Prasidh with the perfect amount of pace to play some strokes. Gets a short ball to climb in the corridor and Faf springs up and gets his weight into this cut shot
15.2,"Prasidh to Jadhav, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, pulled along the floor to deep square"
15.1,"Prasidh to du Plessis, 1 run","length on off stump, dropped in front of point with soft hands"
14.6,"Chawla to Jadhav, no run","length on off stump, dead-batted into the off side on the front foot"
14.5,"Chawla to Jadhav, FOUR runs","casually lifts it one bounce over the long-off boundary! What does it mean to get settled? Length ball outside off, probably a googly too. Half a stride, beautiful hands, nice timing as he goes inside-out"
14.4,"Chawla to Rayudu, OUT","won't survive this time! Length at off stump, looks to sweep, gets a top edge and Rana settles under it from short extra. A few steps to his left and holds on. And a big noise from the crowd - as if it's KKR's home ground."
14.3,"Chawla to du Plessis, 1 run","length in the corridor, pushed to point's right off the back foot"
14.2,"Chawla to Rayudu, 1 run","length at leg stump, flicked to deep square"
14.1,"Chawla to Rayudu, 2 runs",dropped! That catching fielder gets Rayudu to try and go above the infield. But there's been a ball change in the interval and this one grips and spins away from his inside-out shot. He slices it up towards Prasidh who runs in and slides on his knees as he puts this down from in front of his chest and loses balance
13.6,"Kuldeep to du Plessis, no run","full on leg stump, flicked straight to midwicket"
13.5,"Kuldeep to Rayudu, 1 run","googly, short and wide. Gets deep in the crease and cuts to sweeper cover. 71.6kph that ball"

13.3,"Kuldeep to du Plessis, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, on the back foot, hurriedly poked through cover"
13.2,"Kuldeep to du Plessis, 2 runs","oh nice shot. Googly at a length outside off, allows it to land and opens the face late as he drives this to long-off's left. Just the perfect timing to pick up a second"
13.1,"Kuldeep to du Plessis, no run","googly, short and turning away outside off. Looks to punch with no feet. It comes back to the bowler off the toe-end"
12.6,"Chawla to du Plessis, 1 run","length outside off, gets the front leg across and flicks to midwicket's right"
12.5,"Chawla to du Plessis, no run","length just outside off, defended to extra cover off the back foot"
12.4,"Chawla to Rayudu, 1 run","googly, turns in a big way as he goes wide of the crease this time. But it's picked, opens the face and runs this to short third"
12.3,"Chawla to du Plessis, 1 run","short of a length, looked like a googly out of the hand. But once again, just skidding straight on. Backs away to punch to sweeper cover, gets it off the inside half to cover's left"
12.2,"Chawla to Rayudu, 1 run","length on off stump, driven to long-off with the turn"
12.1,"Chawla to du Plessis, 1 run",length and into the pads. Skids straight on. Onto the back foot to flick this to long leg

11.1,"Narine to du Plessis, 1 run","length and flat, 95kph, at off stump. Comfortably on the back foot to punch this to long-on"
10.6,"Kuldeep to du Plessis, 1 run","leading edge as he closes the face too soon. Not sure that was the googly, might have just gone through with the flick too early. Single through cover"
10.5,"Kuldeep to du Plessis, FOUR runs","shot! Finds the gap expertly. Slightly flatter from Kuleep and at a length outside off. Nice, big stride forward and he gets this sweep sweetly to long-on's right"
10.4,"Kuldeep to Rayudu, 1 run","full and loopy on off stump, allows it to come on, gets the front leg out of the way, and drives to long-off"
10.3,"Kuldeep to Rayudu, no run","full and just outside off. Drives against the turn, can't beat Gill's dive to the right at extra cover"
10.2,"Kuldeep to Rayudu, no run","googly at a length on off stump, defended to extra cover"

4.6,"Narine to Raina, OUT","Raina's been living dangerously and he skies this one high in the air and is taken brilliantly by Piyush Chawla, who runbs back from mid-on and puts in a timely dive to catch it inches from the ground!

1.6,"Prasidh to du Plessis, no run","full on the pads, du Plessis misses the flick shot and gets an inside edge back on to the pad"
1.5,"Prasidh to Watson, 1 run","length outside off, steered to point's left and they scamper one"
1.4,"Prasidh to du Plessis, 1 run","length outside off, steered to third-man"
1.3,"Prasidh to du Plessis, no run","lift from the wicket there and beats the bat again! Banged into the surface, quick delivery, du Plessis surprised by thye extra bounce, nearly gloves it behind"
1.2,"Prasidh to du Plessis, no run","beaten! Length outside off, du Plessis has a flash with his feet rooted to the crease and misses"
1.1,"Prasidh to du Plessis, no run","length on middle, pushed to mid-on"
0.6,"Chawla to Watson, no run",
0.5,"Chawla to Watson, SIX runs","killing the chase early here Watson! Short on middle, rocks back and hammers a pull over deep midwicket"
0.4,"Chawla to Watson, no run","slower on middle, he tries to flick it to the on side, turns the face of the bat too early and the leading edge nearly carries back to the bowler"
0.3,"Chawla to Watson, no run","quicker and flatter outside off, looks to cut but it's too full for the stroke and there's no room either"
0.2,"Chawla to Watson, 2 runs","googly outside off, Watson picks it and drags it down to long-on's right, times it well but the fielder gets around it, puts in the slide and hurls the throw back to keep it to two"
0.1,"Chawla to Watson, FOUR runs","full outside off, overpitched and drilled through extra cover for four"
19.6,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, FOUR runs","squeezed past long-off and that's fifty! Short of a length in the corridor again. Stays still and chucks his hands at this. It comes off the toe-end and floats past the bowler. Long-off sprints to his right and puts in a dive, but it dribbles into the boundary"
19.5,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, no run","full toss and he misses out. Low and wide outside off, a misses yorker. Which is why not a lot of bowlers go with that option against him. But his drives is mistimed, straight to extra cover"
19.4,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, FOUR runs","slower short ball is clobbered! WOW! Tremendous hit. Unbelievable strength. Short, dipping at middle. Squats under it and whacks it at deep square. He takes one step to his left and the ball has already reached him on the bounce. He sticks out a hand to try and stop it, but the ball has already ricocheted off him and into the boundary padding"
19.3,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, SIX runs","this will go! Short ball at leg stump, backs away, deep into the crease and swats this over the midwicket boundary! And clutches his forearm immediately. That cramp is acting up. Takes serious hitting on this pitch to clear the boundary"
19.2,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, no run","pulled to deep square's right and they won't run. Short ball at the ribs, doesn't get all of this with the pull"
19.1,"Kuggeleijn to Gurney, 1 run","shot! You beauty, Gurney. A classy looking chip to sweeper cover. Short ball in the corridor, makes room and slices. He can settle in at the other end till the end of the innings now"
18.6,"Chahar to Russell, no run","beaten. Russell doesn't look for the single. Short ball outside off, looks to smoke it into the leg side with a pull but misses. He is exhausted. Possibly has a cramp in his left wrist as well. It's hard trying to hit with that force on this pitch, takes a real toll"
18.5,"Chahar to Russell, no run","slower bouncer wide outside off, jumps up and looks to slap it behind square. Beaten"
18.4,"Chahar to Russell, no run","full outside off, puts everything into this attempted drive on the off side, but it's mistimed again. Along the floor to long-off"
18.3,"Chahar to Russell, SIX runs","just clears Jadeja at long-on! Oh boy, that didn't look like it had traveled the distance when he first hit it. Attempted slog at a short of a length ball, on the front foot, off the bottom of the bat. Jadeja has run in rather than along the rope and this has just cleared him. Out if he was on the line"
18.2,"Chahar to Russell, no run","full and just outside off, looks to drill it straight again. Miscued again. Thick inside edge to short fine's left"
18.1,"Chahar to Russell, no run",length ball slanted in at middle stump. A juicy length ball to slog on most surfaces. Here he can only manage to drag this out to long-on
17.6,"Kuggeleijn to Gurney, no run","crafty late cut down to third man, and on another day, Gurney would have got the chance to celebrate that with a run. Tonight, he stays still. Short ball in the corridor from the bowler"
17.5,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, 1 run","short of a length and skidding in at an off stump line. Looks to cut, but is late on it. Ends up bunting it to extra cover's right off the inside half. Takes the run this time"
17.4,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, no run","short ball at the stumps, backs away and pulls into the turf to find that midwicket fielder who came in after the first ball. Wonder if he could have backed away and got this over the off side"
17.4,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, 1 wide",short and down leg side. Russell gets out of the line with an arched back
17.3,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, no run","short of a length, into the body. Pulls to deep square, doesn't run"
17.2,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, 2 runs",and he bowls short and wide outside off. That's not prudent from the bowler. Lucky that cover dives on top of this cut - looks like Watson - and manages to parry it keep it to two
17.1,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, FOUR runs","swats it to the midwicket boundary. Slower ball at a length outside off, crouches and gets this slog along the floor between deep midwicket and long-on"
16.6,"Jadeja to Gurney, no run","length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
16.5,"Jadeja to Gurney, no run","length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
16.4,"Jadeja to Gurney, no run","length at off stump, blocked on the front foot"
16.3,"Jadeja to Prasidh, OUT",straight to midwicket. Tame. Full and dipping on leg stump. Prasidh looks to flick with hard hands. Can't do that on a slow pitch. Harbhajan has no problem holding onto this one
16.2,"Jadeja to Prasidh, no run","length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
16.1,"Jadeja to Russell, 1 run","misfield by Tahir at backward point. Probably a lot of the Chennai public calling that ""idea fielding"" now. It gets Russell off strike. A powerful cut at a short ball"
16.1,"Jadeja to Russell, 1 wide","short and spinning a long long way past the wide marker outside off. Looks to pull, can't come close"
15.6,"Harbhajan to Russell, 1 run",in the air but safely in front of deep midwicket. A full toss that he can't get hold of with the slog. Once again done by the extra pace
15.5,"Harbhajan to Russell, no run","short of a length, flat outside off. Backs away for the pull but this skids on fast. Back to the bowler off the under-edge"
15.4,"Harbhajan to Kuldeep, OUT","and another. Oh this is poor. Length outside off, dipping, drawing him forward. Kuldeep into a lazy front foot poke. Thick edge past slip. Russell takes for the run. Kuldeep is still trying to get up as backward point picks up and puts in quite a bad throw at the other end. Harbhajan has to lunge and hold on, then recover to flick this onto the stumps. And he does what's required"
15.3,"Harbhajan to Chawla, OUT","goes slow again and gets him out by a long, long way. That's more like the Harbhajan this season. Gets it to dip and spin a long way away from just short of a length. Chawla is down the pitch and swatting all around this. Runs straight off, doesn't even bother trying to get back"
15.2,"Harbhajan to Chawla, no run","tossed up at a length from around the wicket. Chawla leans in and tries to stab through cover, but this hasn't turned enough for him to get the shot away. Down the pitch off the inside half"
15.1,"Harbhajan to Russell, 1 run","slugged to deep midwicket. Harbhajan is nervous now. He bowls slowly normally, it's how he got Narine. This is at a length and pushed through fast outside off"
14.6,"Tahir to Russell, 1 run","length outside off, leans in, drives to long-off"
14.5,"Tahir to Russell, no run","they've reviewed an lbw decision, have CSK. This is a legbreak that has hit Russell in front of middle as he looks to flick with a short stride. Spinning a long way though. Is there bat on it? Tiny murmur on UltraEdge but that is not bat deems the umpire. But that's okay for Russell. It's spinning past off stump. CSK lose the review. Dhoni was sheepish when he took that, he was taking a chance on it."
14.4,"Tahir to Russell, no run","oh loooopy. Tahir lobs it right up, gets it to dip on a length just outside off. Russell almost falls for it - sets up for the sweep, but lets it go"
14.3,"Tahir to Russell, FOUR runs","get out of the way! No way Tahir is sticking his hand out at this. Backs away, meets it as a full toss and drills it to his left. Not even long-off can come close to that"
14.2,"Tahir to Russell, no run","full on off stump, driven firmly towards long-on. Tahir dives and stops one-handed"
14.1,"Tahir to Russell, no run","length and just outside off, driven back to the bowler"
13.6,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, 1 run",length and into his body as he backs into the leg side. Hurriedly defends pitch side on the off side and steals the single
13.5,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, FOUR runs",another mis-hit but this one is safely between deep square and deep midwicket. Length ball coming in at leg stump. Backs away and swipes hard at this. It comes off the low part of the bat and the inside half
13.4,"Kuggeleijn to Chawla, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked to fine leg"
13.3,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, 1 run",Jadeja jumps and keeps this in at deep midwicket. Short ball. Russell hooks and miscues. Jadeja runs to his right and recognises that he might not be in control if he goes with both hands to catch this. So he gets his left hand across and pushes this in from in front of his right shoulder like a goalkeeper. Superb dexterity
13.2,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, no run","bouncer and he ducks under this. Not a quick pitch, picks the length early and lets it go"
13.1,"Kuggeleijn to Russell, no run","short of a length outside off, opens his stance and taps this to mid-off"
12.6,"Tahir to Chawla, no run","slider from a length across off stump, looks for the late cut, beaten"
12.5,"Tahir to Chawla, SIX runs","see ya! Length ball tossed up outside off and Piyush Chawla is all swag here - a cap, a stride, a big swing and big six over midwicket"
12.4,"Tahir to Chawla, no run",
12.3,"Tahir to Russell, 1 run","short of a length on middle stump, punched to deep midwicket off the back foot"
12.2,"Tahir to Russell, no run","dropped! Harbhajan has lost the trajectory in the night sky and has ended up having to lunge backwards after getting under this at midwicket! A floated legbreak from Tahir, Russell looks for the slog sweep and top edges. He looks into the floor immediately - what have I done? - but he survives. Will that haunt CSK all evening?"
12.1,"Tahir to Russell, no run","length ball, sliding through in the corridor. Hurriedly punched into the covers"
11.6,"Harbhajan to Chawla, no run","full outside off, languidly leans in and drives to extra cover"
11.5,"Harbhajan to Chawla, no run","tossed up wide outside off, opens the face and runs this to backward point"
11.4,"Harbhajan to Chawla, no run","length outside off, leans in and defends to backward point"
11.3,"Harbhajan to Russell, 1 run","flat, short of a length on middle stump. Flicked into the open leg side"
11.2,"Harbhajan to Russell, SIX runs","strike one! Russell will be delighted at the ball coming into him. This is at a length on middle, slightly flat. Uses his reach and creams the slog sweep over the midwicket zone"
11.1,"Harbhajan to Russell, no run","length at middle stump, gets on the back foot and pokes to midwicket"
10.6,"Tahir to Chawla, no run",stumping appeal sent upstairs. Googly tossed up outside off. Chawla beaten on the drive. Foot went up briefly but is just back in. He survives.
10.5,"Tahir to Russell, 1 run","full outside off, looks to drill through the covers. Gets it down to long-off"
10.4,"Tahir to Chawla, 1 run","full googly in the corridor, gets low and sweeps to long leg"
10.3,"Tahir to Chawla, no run","length outside off, driven straight to extra cover"
10.2,"Tahir to Chawla, no run","length on middle stump, stays deep in the crease and pushes it back down the pitch"
10.1,"Tahir to Gill, OUT","got him! Tahir sneaks through Gill with a googly. He falls over trying to flick without a big stride. It slips through between inside edge and leg, Dhoni picks it up and takes the bails off. It doesn't even need to be sent upstairs. It's going downhill FAST for KKR"
9.6,"Jadeja to Russell, no run","length on middle, turn and bounce for Jadeja again, Russell wait for it this time, is squared up a little, but defends safely in the end"
9.5,"Jadeja to Russell, no run","beauty! pitches middle, turns square, beats the outside edge with vicious turn away"
9.4,"Jadeja to Russell, no run","length on off, slower, Russell waits for it and pushes to point"

9.2,"Jadeja to Gill, 1 run","full on off, driven to long-off"
9.1,"Jadeja to Gill, 2 runs","length outside off, bit of width on off, Gill chops it away past the diving point fielder for two"
8.6,"Tahir to Russell, no run","length outside off, straighter one, Russell shoulders arms in anticlimactic fashion"
8.5,"Tahir to Russell, no run","googly, tossed up outside off, Russell lunges forward, smothers the spin and defends with bat and pad close"
8.4,"Tahir to Karthik, OUT","That's the big fish, the captain, who was looking good so far! It was full on middle, Karthik whipped it nicely, taking it from the stumps, hit it flat and hard but aerially and straight to midwicket, where Harbhajan clung onto a sharp chance. He probably wanted to clear the man and would have had four, instead it's half the side back in the hut"
8.3,"Tahir to Karthik, FOUR runs","full on the legs, Karthik goes down on one knee and tickles it really really fine for a cheeky boundary"
8.2,"Tahir to Karthik, 2 runs","tossed up outside off, slightly overpitched, driven to the left of long-off for a couple"
8.1,"Tahir to Gill, 1 run","quicker one the pads, pushed to deep midwicket"
7.6,"Harbhajan to Gill, 1 run","length on off, top spinner this time, tries to push it to mid-on, a little early into the shot and gets a thick inside edge down to deep squareleg"

7.4,"Harbhajan to Gill, no run","quicker and flatter on middle, pushed back to the bowler"
7.3,"Harbhajan to Gill, no run","length on middle, pushed to midwicket"

4.5,"Chahar to Karthik, no run","length on middle, defended"
4.4,"Chahar to Uthappa, OUT","that's the third wicket to the cross batted pull! Chahar on the charge in the Power-play again. The shot hasn't been on tonight, this was a slower short ball, bounced a little extra, caught him on the splice and went high up in the air towards deep squareleg, who eventually had to put in a dive forward to take it"
4.3,"Chahar to Uthappa, no run","full on middle, drilled back to the bowler, and the non striker, who was backing up could have been in a spot of bother"
4.2,"Chahar to Uthappa, FOUR runs","short and this time it's a little too short and Uthappa can rock back, control the stroke even as it keeps a tad low and lift it over midwicket and down to the boundary"

2.4,"Chahar to Karthik, no run","length outside off, hint of shape away, let through to the keeper"
2.3,"Chahar to Rana, OUT","another unwarranted stroke and that's the third KKR wicket! Length on middle, he goes for the pull shot, it keeps a tad low again, skids onto Rana as well, who only manages to toe-end it to midwicket, where Rayudu takes a neat catch diving forward"

1.5,"Harbhajan to Narine, OUT","another one bites the dust! Both openers gone! Harbhajan tosses it up, teasing Narine on a pitch offering him considerable help, Narine tries to slog him into oblivion, only managing a top edge, high in the air towards point, who had to run back and dive to his left to complete an excellent catch"

0.6,"Chahar to Lynn, OUT","Gone! Lynn early into the pull shot again, it was a straight delivery on a length, did not rise at all and struck Lynn in front. Not a pitch to play across the line and Lynn pays the price"

7.4,"M Nabi to Agarwal, no run","fired full on the stumps, turned to the leg side"
7.3,"M Nabi to Agarwal, no run","struck plumb? Woah, this is very close. Not sure why they didn't even think of referring. Mayank struck on the pad as he attempts to sweep a full delivery"
7.2,"M Nabi to Rahul, 1 run",steps out and bunts this down to long-on

1.5,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run",misfield at short midwicket allows a single when there should have been none
1.4,"Sandeep to Gayle, 1 run","driven superbly, but this is an excellent stop at the edge of the ring at cover. Sid Kaul, I think. Saved three runs"

14.5,"Sam Curran to Pandey, no run","short of length outside off, fails to connect the upper cut though"
14.4,"Sam Curran to Pandey, no run","length ball around middle and leg, Pandey looks to flick it away and misses. An appeal for lbw but not out. Looked plumb unless there was some inside edge. Ashwin gestures it was perhaps going down but replays show it would have taken the off stump out"
14.3,"Sam Curran to Warner, 1 run","fuller on the stumps, looks to go over long-on but fails to middle it, the lack of timing perhaps saved him there, a single to long-on"

Ashwin goes low to his right, and gets a hand to it, the ball almost stops there and he then flicks it with his left hand on to the stumps at the non-striker's end, Nabi was way too out of his crease"
13.1,"Ashwin to M Nabi, 1 run","fuller, almost a yorker on the leg stump, Nabi digs it out towards long-on"

18.4,"Prasidh to Smith, 2 wide",beaten as he steps into the off side for the ramp. It's past off stump and an extremely harsh wide call from the umpire. That ball went through where Smith was in his stance. DK stops as they steal an extra

Tripathi has the right idea - to go inside-out over extra - but that's difficult to execute on this pitch and against this bowler. Lifts it high and it's an easy catch"
15.3,"Gurney to Tripathi, no run",raps his pad with a regular paced full ball. It's pitched outside leg. Tripathi cross with himself after missing on the flick

14.2,"Prasidh to Smith, 1 run","full on leg stump, stays deep in the crease and flicks to deep midwicket"

13.3,"Narine to Tripathi, 1 run","length at the stumps, nudged to deep midwicket"
13.2,"Narine to Smith, 1 leg bye","length on middle stump, gets forward for the flick and misses. Cops it on the pad, runs and survives the run-out chance at the other end as DK misses with the throw. They decide not to review the lbw, probably going down"

11.5,"Gurney to Buttler, OUT","finds deep midwicket this time! Not easy to hit sixes! Another slower ball, dipping at a length on off stump. Lines it up and keeps his shape as he slugs across the line, but Gill is there, inches from the boundary, to take this calmly"
11.4,"Gurney to Buttler, SIX runs","clears deep square! That took some power. Slower ball, short and in at the body. Tough to hit these shots off the back foot on this surface, but Buttler puts everything into this pull"

7.6,"Narine to Buttler, 1 leg bye","length ball, pitching on middle and leg and going down, Buttler was on the back foot, looks to flick but misses. There is an appeal for lbw but I think it was missing leg. DK and Narine having a chat but they have run out of the time"
7.5,"Narine to Smith, 1 leg bye","a touch fuller on middle and leg, looks to sweep but misses, gets a leg-bye as the ball rolls behind square"

7.6,"Rabada to Kohli, 1 run","short and quick, Kohli wanted to pull it but was very late on it, gets it off the end of the bat and it loops up and falls just behind Rabada. Wasn't in control of that at all, but got enough on it to not be at catching height for the bowler"
7.5,"Rabada to Stoinis, 1 run","oh that seemed to slip out of his hand a bit, ends up as a full toss just below the waist on leg stump. Turned to midwicket"

4.4,"Sharma to Kohli, 1 leg bye","a bit late on that, and the leading edge rolls towards point. Kohli was looking to go across and clip it into the legside again, but this was at 138 kph, and he brought his bat down a touch late"

3.6,"Morris to AB, 1 run","run out chance missed too full outside off and AB drives it powerfully, but straight to extra cover. Sets off for a run and the fielder takes aim and throws, but misses the stumps. No one backing up but they don't take the overthrow because AB's momentum took him very far down the bowler's end too.

1.2,"Morris to Kohli, 1 run","fuller on the stumps, and Kohli taps it towards mid-on to get off strike"
1.1,"Morris to Kohli, FOUR runs","just past a widish slip that bounce is doing its work. Great length from Morris and gets it to rise uncomfortably high. Kohli wanted to steer it away, gets it high on the bat. Dhawan at a wide slip dives to his right but the ball just eludes him"

17.4,"Joseph to Kaul, OUT","and Joseph has the record for best IPL figures! And can you believe it, this has come on his IPL debut. What a superstar. Length ball, wide outside off, and he tries to dab a cut fine. Takes a thick edge, and QdK makes no mistake. Sunrisers are 96 all out, Mumbai win by 40 runs!"
17.3,"Joseph to Sandeep, 1 run","back of a length, wide outside off, and cut away to point"
17.2,"Joseph to Sandeep, FOUR runs","full on middle, and angling down leg. Sharma flicks fine behind square, and fine leg can't cut it off"
17.1,"Joseph to Bhuvneshwar, OUT","five for! Full on middle, and Bhuvi walks across the stumps to try and nudge it fine. Bhuvi's beaten for pace, and the ball has crashed into middle stump. Is that a no-ball? Nope!"

16.3,"Bumrah to M Nabi, no run","play and a miss! Length ball on middle, and the delivery holds it's line after pitching. Nabi was expecting the ball to come into his body, and therefore misses the attempted flat-batted pull. Through to QdK"

15.4,"Joseph to Hooda, OUT","shatters the stumps! Full and straight, and Hooda tries to clear long on. Inside-edged onto middle stump and Joseph stands tall to soak in the applause. What a debut for the youngster. Timeout"
15.4,"Joseph to Hooda, 1 wide","full toss on leg stump, but going down the leg side again. Gotta reload, but Hooda's disappointed not getting any bat on it"
15.3,"Joseph to M Nabi, 1 bye","slower ball, offcutter wide outside off but inside the tramlines. He tries to muscle an inside-out drive over cover, but can't get bat on ball. De Kock fumbles too, and that allows the batsmen to pinch a run"

15.1,"Joseph to Hooda, no run","yorker wide outside off, and it's even the slower ball. Batsman stretches outwards to reach at it, but can't connect"
14.6,"Bumrah to M Nabi, SIX runs","flat-batted over long off! Ridiculous from Nabi. Back of a length, wide outside off, but Nabi backs away and muscles an uppish tennis-bat shot for six. Mid-off was inside the circle, so fairly calculated from the Afghanistan allrounder"
14.5,"Bumrah to M Nabi, no run","short of length, outside off, looks to pull. But mistimed to short midwicket"
14.4,"Bumrah to M Nabi, no run","back of a length on middle, and following the batsman. Soars over Nabi's shoulders"

12.4,"Behrendorff to Hooda, no run","length ball on off, and he guides this to point. But Hardik runs across the grass to intercept, and stops a certain single. Mumbai's fielders are pumped"
12.3,"Behrendorff to Hooda, 2 runs","full on middle, and he shuffles across before driving straight down the ground. Long-on cleans up"
12.2,"Behrendorff to Hooda, no run","length ball, outside off and angling across. Tries to ride the bounce and punch this through the off side, but the shot can't clear point"

11.6,"Chahar to Hooda, no run","full, just outside off, and fended away to cover"
11.5,"Chahar to M Nabi, 1 run","top-edged and nearly caught by first slip! Excellent effort from Rohit. He tries to sweep this again, but it flies off the glove, and goes over Rohit at first slip. He does really well trying to chase the ball, but it falls just beyond him"

11.3,"Chahar to Hooda, FOUR runs","length ball, wide outside off, and the legbreak is cut away to the deep point boundary! Loose ball, gets the treatment it deserved"
11.2,"Chahar to Pathan, OUT","full, just outside off, and Yusuf goes for an expansive sweep. Tries to drag this from beyond the stumps, and that's been top-edged to the fielder at deep square leg. Chahar's on a roll, folks!"

6.3,"Joseph to Shankar, no run","length ball, angles into him, and he defends this"

4.1,"Joseph to Warner, OUT","GOT 'IM! Bowls this fuller, and a touch wider, and Warner throws the kitchen sink at this one. Not in shape at all, and gets an inside edge on to his stumps. Perhaps needed to watch him out for a bit, but that's the two big wickets that Mumbai would have wanted. Sunrisers with a slightly untested middle order needing to get the job done"

Smart bowling, because there has been some grip on this pitch, and that forced it to just hold on the pitch, and that goes straight to Bumrah at point. That's the first wicket that Sunrisers have lost in the Powerplay this season. Also the first partnership under 50 from these two"

17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Chahar, FOUR runs","late cut past the keeper's right! Length ball, wide outside off, and Chahar dabs this to the third-man boundary once again"
17.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Pollard, 1 run","dropped by Rashid! Full outside off, and Pollard slices an uppish drive over cover. Rashid - at deep extra cover - runs across the boundary to try and take the catch, but the ball pops out!"
17.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Pollard, no run","back of the hand slower ball, landing outside off on a good length. Pollard reaches forward to try and meet the ball, but he loses his balance. Ball goes past his outside edge to Bairstow"
16.6,"Rashid Khan to Chahar, 2 runs","length ball, just outside off, and he plays another deft late cut. This time it's placed past first-slip's right, and Bhuvi - from point - needs to give this ball a chase"
16.5,"Rashid Khan to Chahar, no run","quicker ball, length on middle, and skidding through. Fended away to the off side"
16.4,"Rashid Khan to Chahar, FOUR runs","length ball, just outside off, but the googly allows Chahar to play a late cut. Placed between keeper and first slip and this races away to the third-man boundary"
16.3,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, OUT","swept, but straight to deep midwicket! Full just outside off, and Hardik tries to drag a sweep to the leg side. So sweetly timed, but without the elevation. Taken by Vijay Shankar near the boundary. Hardik goes for a strike-rate of only 100"
16.2,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run","drilled but stopped by Rashid's boots! Overpitched on off, and Hardik struck this hard"
16.1,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, SIX runs","outta here! Full, wide outside off, and the googly is met by Hardik's bat swing. Swings across the line, and hammers this beyond the long-on boundary"
15.6,"Sandeep to Pollard, no run","length ball on off, and some extra bounce forces Pollard to defend off the back foot"
15.6,"Sandeep to Pollard, 1 wide","slower ball again but this isn't well directed. Full on middle, but angling down leg"

15.4,"Sandeep to Pandya, no run","slower ball, full outside off and Hardik goes for an expansive drive over the bowler's head. Except, the bat's nowhere near the ball when he swings the blade. Through to the keeper on the bounce"

15.2,"Sandeep to Pandya, 1 run","struck hard past the bowler but intercepted by long on. Full, on off, and Hardik brings his bat down to meet it with the full face. Hit past Sandeep's right"
15.1,"Sandeep to Pollard, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and he drills a back-foot punched drive to long on for a walking single"
14.6,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, 1 run","shouts of catch it but ball lands safely. Full on off, and Pollard tries to hit this over long on. Ball hits the inside-half of his bat, and flies towards square leg instead"
14.5,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, 1 run","half-tracker on middle, and pushed off the back foot to deep midwicket for one"
14.4,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run","beauty! Full on off, and Hardik comes forward to defend the googly. But the ball turns away from Hardik, and just misses his outside edge. Well kept by Bairstow"
14.3,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run","full on off, and nudged off the front foot to the off side. Can't beat the fielder at cover"

13.5,"Kaul to Pandya, 1 run","back of a length on off, and punched firmly to long on"
13.4,"Kaul to Pandya, no run","beauty! Length ball outside off, but once again tailing inwards. Hardik tries to defend off the back foot, but the ball doesn't come in as much. Whizzing past his outside edge once again"
13.3,"Kaul to Pandya, 2 runs","length ball, just outside off, and he tries to fend with the bat's straight face again, but this time a thick outside edge takes it to third man for a single"

13.1,"Kaul to Pollard, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and he toe-ends a defensive shot to point. Enough time to steal a run"
12.6,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, 2 runs","length ball, wide outside off, and punched with the turn to deep extra cover"
12.5,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, OUT","could be run-out, but Bairstow has broken the stumps prematurely! Is that out? Length ball on middle, and he tries to work this towards the leg side. Leading edge takes it to cover as they try to pinch a single. Pollard sends Kishan back from halfway down with Shankar quickly releasing the ball  and Kishan's struggling to get back. Kishan would've definitely been out if Bairstow hadn't dislodged the bails with his body, but a close look at the replay shows Kishan's gone either way! Bairstow managed to uproot the stumps before Kishan could complete his dive in. Milimeters!"
12.4,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, no run","yorker on middle, and Kishan digs this away to the leg side. But Rashid appeals for the lbw thinking it's boot first, and not bat. Umpire turns it down, but Sunrisers don't have a review"

12.2,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off, and punched down the ground to long on for single"

11.6,"Kaul to Ishan, no run","full on middle, and he tentatively defends off the front foot. Kaul bends forward to intercept the ball"
11.5,"Kaul to Pollard, 1 run","length ball, angling into his pads. Pollard walks down the wicket, and flicks to midwicket"
11.4,"Kaul to Krunal, OUT","top-edged but taken by the keeper! Sid Kaul spread-eagles in celebration. Back of a length on leg, and he hurries Krunal into playing the pull. Mild top-edge, and Bairstow has to run a few steps forward to complete the catch. They're checking for the no-ball, but Kaul's fine"
11.3,"Kaul to Ishan, 1 run","length ball, slower on off, and Kishan steers a late cut down to third man. Sandeep Sharma the fielder down there"

11.1,"Kaul to Krunal, 1 run","length ball on leg, and he shapes up to flick off his hips. Placed behind to deep backward square, but there's protection right there"

10.5,"Rashid Khan to Krunal, 1 run","full on off, and tapped away to cover for a quick single"
10.5,"Rashid Khan to Krunal, 3 wide","length ball, on leg, and turning into his body. Tries to nudge it fine down the leg side, but misses. The keeper misses too, so they run across for a couple. Incorrect call from the umpire though, since it grazed his thigh guard. Extra ball needs to be bowled"
10.4,"Rashid Khan to Krunal, no run","length ball, just outside off, and he looks to sweep against the googly. Bails quickly whipped off, but Krunal's back leg is in. The TV umpire confirms that"

10.2,"Rashid Khan to Krunal, no run","length ball, wide outside off and turning further away. He tries to flat-bat a pull to the leg side, but the ball hits the toe of his bat"
10.1,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 1 run","length ball from Rashid outside off, and sliding away. Backs away to cut square to deep point"

8.3,"Kaul to Krunal, no run","length ball, angles across him, and he defends this"
8.2,"Kaul to de Kock, OUT","length, and he biffs this towards midwicket, but holes out! May have bowled this a bit slower through the air, but de Kock was a bit early into the shot, went for the whip over deep midwicket, but got the ball squarer than he might have intended. No problems for Hooda in pouching this, a similar dismissal to Rohit Sharma's"
8.1,"Kaul to Ishan, 1 run","length ball, angles across him, and he taps it towards point and picks up a quick single"
7.6,"M Nabi to Ishan, 1 run","length, and he comes forward and flicks this towards short midwicket"

5.1,"M Nabi to de Kock, 1 run",goes back and punches a length ball angling into him towards square leg
4.6,"Sandeep to Yadav, OUT","fuller ball, and he looks to play across the line. Given out, and he wants to review this. Walked across his stumps, and virtually attempted a sweep. Maybe impact outside the line of off stump could save him? There's no sign of an inside-edge. Stays with umpire's call"
4.5,"Sandeep to Yadav, 2 runs","length, and he pushes this towards midwicket"
4.4,"Sandeep to Yadav, no run","slower ball, outside the off stump, and he leaves one hand off the handle as he looks to drive. Goes uppishly, but on the bounce towards cover"
4.3,"Sandeep to Yadav, no run","length ball, and he plays this back towards the bowler. He could have latched on to this, but then it would have been a really good catch"
4.2,"Sandeep to Yadav, no run","length ball, and he it swings a bit away from him, and he plays this away towards point"
4.1,"Sandeep to Yadav, FOUR runs","length ball, and he punches this past the bowler down towards the long off fence"
3.6,"M Nabi to Yadav, 1 run","length, and he plays this away towards square leg"
3.5,"M Nabi to Yadav, no run","appeal for a caught behind! And they have gone upstairs for this. Angles across Yadav, who presses forward to defend, goes past the outside edge, and Bairstow whips the bails off. SRH look quite confident about this, but Yadav did well to plant his back foot in time. Should be not out, I think and is"
3.4,"M Nabi to Rohit Sharma, OUT","GONE! Nabi had placed deep midwicket and deep backward square leg as his two boundary-riders, and bowled this to perfection. Tosses this up just outside off, and Rohit takes the bait and looks to go towards long on. The ball turns and grips just enough to force him to go more towards midwicket, where Deepak Hooda hardly needs to move to pocket this big wicket for the home side"
3.3,"M Nabi to de Kock, 1 run","tosses this up, wide outside off, and he goes for a cut, gets it to the right of point. Good effort from Kaul to keep it down to just one"

2.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","fuller ball, and he tries to go for the scoop, but plays it on to his body. They set off for a quick single, and Bhuvi gets to this, but cannot strike the stumps at the other end"

1.3,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","slower ball, and he comes down the wicket and chips it towards mid on. Nabi has a shy at the stumps at the non-striker's end, and Rohit has to put in a dive to get in"

1.1,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","length ball, swings into him, and he plays this towards square leg"
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","hes's come down the wicket and scooped this straight up. Goes towards third man, and Siddarth Kaul drops it! Just didn't get his body underneath a skier, and eventually had to sprawl away to his left, making a hash of that early chance. Don't think he got his fingers to that, actually "
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, no run","full, strikes him on the pads as he looks to play this straight. Are they going to review this? They have! Just toppled over a bit as he played the shot, and the ball jagged back in. It passes close to the bat as well, and there's a spike when the ball passes by the bat. Not out!  Review lost, too"
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, no run","fuller, wider, and he punches this towards cover, where Manish Pandey is quick to hold on to it"
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit Sharma, no run","fuller, outside off, and he drives this towards mid off"

6.6,"Jadeja to Rahul, no run","another dot ball, back of a length at middle and off, no width and not much pace to work with, can't find a gap on the leg side. Tidy over"

2.2,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","short of a length outside off, 128kph, played off the back foot to the off side"
2.1,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","full and straight, clipped firmly to midwicket"
1.6,"Harbhajan to Agarwal, OUT","taken at long-on! That's poor batting charged down the pitch, was nowhere near the ball, he slices across the ball and it only finds Faf du Plessis stationed near the fence"

1.4,"Harbhajan to Gayle, OUT","caught behind! Full outside off, Gayle goes for a booming drive away from his body, the umpire's finger goes up. Gayle just stands there for a little while, unsure whether to review or not, has a brief chat with Rahul and then walks (slowly) off. Ultra Edge confirms a nick"

19.4,"Shami to Dhoni, 1 run","short of length and pulled again towards fine leg, only a single this time"
19.3,"Shami to Dhoni, FOUR runs",bowls a bouncer this time with fine leg up - a cardinal sin. Dhoni pulls it over the fielder and collects a boundary

19.1,"Shami to Rayudu, SIX runs","fuller on the stumps, in the slot for Rayudu who clears his front leg and smashes it over long-on, brings up the 50-run stand with that six - off 35 balls"
18.6,"Sam Curran to Dhoni, 2 runs","a low full toss outside off and Dhoni has steered it through the point region, the sweeper cover sprints to his left this time and keeps it to two"

18.4,"Sam Curran to Dhoni, FOUR runs","one-bouncer four this time, didn't middle it but still got enough and in the gap more importantly. Length ball on the stumps and Dhoni swings across, got it off the toe-end but that's enough for a boundary"

18.2,"Sam Curran to Dhoni, 1 run","slower length ball outside off, cuts it towards extra cover for one"
18.1,"Sam Curran to Dhoni, SIX runs","clubbed over deep midwicket this time, was fuller on the pads and Dhoni frees his arms and it keeps sailing over"
18.1,"Sam Curran to Dhoni, 1 wide","fuller but down the leg side this time, Dhoni goes for the flick but cannot get any bat on it, called a wide. But Ashwin has decided to review it! For caught-behind! Nothing on the UltraEdge and it stays not out"

17.5,"Tye to Dhoni, FOUR runs","powered down the ground this time, uses his feet and forces it towards the right of long-off, it's drilled so hard that he has no chance to cut it off"

12.2,"Ashwin to du Plessis, SIX runs","swept and swept hard, a flat six to bring up his fifty off 33 balls. His fourth six of the innings to go with two fours. Was a touch fuller outside off and he just drilled it over deep square leg"

7.6,"Ashwin to Raina, 1 wide","speared very wide outside off, he'll need to bowl that again"
7.5,"Ashwin to du Plessis, 1 run","very short outside off, not sure what variation that was out, only costs a single as he finds deep cover. Different run-up from Ashwin"

7.3,"Ashwin to du Plessis, 1 run","short outside off, he waits on the back foot and drives to deep cover"

6.1,"Ashwin to du Plessis, no run","over the wicket, good length, pushed to cover"

5.4,"Sam Curran to Watson, no run","dropped, and nearly an injury! A short-of-a-length delivery is hammered straight back at the bowler, Curran can't get his hands to it and it smacks into his shoulder. Luckily avoided the face. He takes a moment to compose himself but seems okay"

5.1,"Sam Curran to du Plessis, 1 run","still round the wicket, full and straight, driven to mid-off on the edge of the circle"

3.6,"Sam Curran to Watson, 1 run","short of a length, he goes for the pull from a crouched position, comes off the splice but falls short of deep midwicket. Kings XI probably won't mind he's kept the strike"

2.4,"Shami to du Plessis, FOUR runs",walked down the pitch again and threads the gap square through the off side as he drives a back-of-a-length delivery. That's very well done
2.3,"Shami to du Plessis, FOUR runs","hammered down the ground as du Plessis gets his boundary away. Took a skip down the pitch, gave himself a touch of room, and drove on the up straight of mid-off"
2.2,"Shami to Watson, 1 run","short of a length, he heaves across the line, the bat twists in his hand and he mistimes towards midwicket"
2.1,"Shami to du Plessis, 1 run","back of a length at the stumps, worked backward of square as he closes the face"

0.4,"Shami to du Plessis, 1 run","length ball outside off, perhaps just a hint of movement away, opens the face down to third man"

0.2,"Shami to Watson, 1 run","short of a length, straight, knocked into space at midwicket so that's the first run off the bat"
0.1,"Shami to Watson, no run","straightens the line, back of a length, smacks into the pads put it's quite high so no danger of the lbw"
0.1,"Shami to Watson, 1 wide","full, pushed away down the leg side, so the contest starts with a wide low carry to the keeper"
19.1,"Negi to Gill, 1 run","length, turns into him and he tucks this away to long leg"
18.6,"Southee to Russell, SIX runs","length, and he smacks this straight back over the bowler. Scores are level!"
18.5,"Southee to Russell, FOUR runs","short, and he gets under this and guides it over short fine leg and down to the fence for four. ARE YOU SERIOUS?"
18.4,"Southee to Russell, SIX runs","full toss, and he swings this over deep midwicket. WHOA!"

18.2,"Southee to Russell, SIX runs","length, and he picks it up and goes over long leg. What a shot! Just clears his leg and then swings freely. This is a pitch which gives full premium for such attempts"
18.1,"Southee to Gill, 1 run","length, and he picks it up and gets it down to long on"
17.6,"Stoinis to Gill, 1 run","length, and he drives this down the ground to long on"

17.4,"Stoinis to Russell, SIX runs","length, outside off, and he has deposited this deep over long off"
17.3,"Stoinis to Russell, SIX runs","slower ball, and he gets hold of it, and swings this over long on. Slapped, almost like a double-handed forehand crosscourt!"
17.3,"Siraj to Russell, (no ball) SIX runs","full toss, and will be called a no ball, and he has hit this out of the ground. Way over midwicket!"
17.3,"Siraj to Russell, 1 wide","short, and will be called wide, as Russell tries to have a poke at it, but cannot reach it"

16.6,"Saini to Karthik, OUT","full, and he goes towards midwicket, but cannot beat the man stationed there this time. Chahal waits for it, and takes it nice and low to his right, and then sets off on a celebratory sprint! DK thumps his pads in annoyance, but he had to up the ante"
16.5,"Saini to Karthik, SIX runs","length, and he whips this one towards midwicket, and just clears the fence. Good shot!"

15.6,"Chahal to Karthik, 1 leg bye","drifts down the pads, and he shapes to flick this towards short fine leg"
15.5,"Chahal to Karthik, no run","turns from a good length, and opens up Karthik. Strikes him on the pad as it turns away, and Karthik is given out! He has referred this immediately. The front foot is fine, the ball appears to pitch in line, and there's no outside edge on this. Should be gone, as it strikes him on the back leg. Chahal has turned this match on its head. Oh no it's missing the stumps! For height!"

14.4,"Axar Patel to Pathan, no run","length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
14.3,"Axar Patel to Shankar, OUT","taken at extra cover! Welcome to the new DC universe, where easy chases don't exist. Short of a length and gripping in the pitch as he gets on the back foot for the cut. That's a single at sweeper on most pitches but here he's through the shot before the ball's arrived.

6.5,"Tewatia to Bairstow, OUT","given! But Bairstow reviews. Yorker on leg, and the ball hits Bairstow's toe. Tewatia appeals, umpire raises his finger, but Bairstow is quick to review. Surely that's an inside-edge? Or so he feels. Replays suggest no edge but Bairstow looks certain he's hit the ball. Wry smile on his face as we wait for ball-tracking.

2.5,"Lamichhane to Warner, no run","full outside leg stump, and the googly hits Warner as he tries to sweep. Question is whether it's pitching outside leg stump, but Sandeep has convinced Iyer. Pant said 'don't review', but Iyer listens to his bowler. The ball has pitched outside leg, so that's a review wasted"
2.4,"Lamichhane to Warner, 2 runs","full on leg, and turning into Warner's body. The attempted straight drive is sliced past cover. Iyer gives the ball a chase"

19.6,"Kaul to Axar Patel, SIX runs","straight over his head! Axar has called Kaul's line, length, and pace, and then he's made full use. Slower ball at a good length outside off. He stepped into it's line and slapped it off the front foot, straight over the sightscreen!"
19.5,"Kaul to Axar Patel, 2 runs","got good connection on this but Hooda slides to his right and gets his body behind this. Length ball, slower outside off. He stepped out and crashed it on the up"
19.4,"Kaul to Axar Patel, SIX runs","lovely hit! Length ball at leg stump, gets behind the line and lifts it on the rise. Every time the seamers have gone back to their normal paces, they've been hit. Near impossible to lift one from short of a length like this other wise. But he's done superbly to get it over wide long-on"

18.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Rabada, 2 runs",dropped at deep square! Sandeep gets under the ball and gets shaky hands to put down a simple chance. Length ball on leg stump. looks for the uppish flick and lobs it straight up. He crouches in the end and possibly loses balance as a result. Should have taken that standing
18.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Axar Patel, 1 run","length and wide outside off, can't get the drive past extra cover"
18.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Morris, OUT","outfoxed him! Such a good defensive strategy from Bhuvneshwar and perfectly executed. A legcutter at a good length, just inside the wide marker. It's the ball Chahal uses too against big-hitters. Morris wants to pump it over extra cover but it's slow and it's off the toe-end of the bat. Nabi pedals a little to his left and holds on"

16.1,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, OUT","loses his cool! Just when he'd set up for a big end to a solid innings, Iyer swipes across the line to Rashid. It's not advisable. This comes in from a length outside off and is past the inside edge to hit off stump"

14.4,"Rashid Khan to Morris, 1 leg bye","googly, turning into the pad from a length. Deflected towards short fine"
14.3,"Rashid Khan to Morris, no run",beaten on the reverse sweep. Full slider outside off and he can't get the bat down on it
14.2,"Rashid Khan to Morris, no run","Rashid gets a review on lbw. He was looking to sweep the length ball again, but was struck on the back leg. Was it outside the line? A slider from Rashid, no turn on it. Back thigh. Looks to me like it's marginally outside off stump yes, marginal. Just enough to be umpire's call. And it is missing the stumps too. He survives, but does he know what's happening? Doesn't look like it."

13.3,"Kaul to Ingram, OUT",taken at point! Pandey lunges to his left and plucks a dying ball! Ingram is gone. Big wicket. Slower ball short of a length outside off.

13.2,"Kaul to Iyer, 1 run",run-out chance missed! Manish Pandey throws at the striker's end after swooping down on this at point. Narrowly misses the single stump. Length ball was poked into the off side with soft hands and Ingram wasn't even trying to make his ground there

12.3,"Sandeep to Iyer, FOUR runs","handsome! Iyer stands tall and pulls off the front foot. The DC coach will be proud of that. Length ball in the corridor, not a slower one this time and he plants the front leg out to lift this over midwicket"
12.2,"Sandeep to Iyer, no run","slower ball at a length on off stump, pushed to point on the rise"
12.1,"Sandeep to Ingram, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, looks to chop behind square but this skids low. Under-edge to keeper's left"
11.6,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, no run",beaten. Legbreak at a length outside off. Leans in and looks to drive. Past the outside edge

10.5,"Sandeep to Tewatia, OUT","taken at cover! Nabi runs to his right and takes this. Superb bowling this. A knuckle ball, good length and just outside off. Hangs the bat out at it and is completely beaten in pace. Chips it harmlessly into the off side"
10.4,"Sandeep to Tewatia, no run",on the body as he takes the pace off this. Grips in the surface just outside off as he looks to flick and it's deflected to the keeper. Looked to come off the glove
10.3,"Sandeep to Tewatia, FOUR runs","shot! Difficult to hit that on a seemingly slow pitch. Length ball just outside off, stands tall and punches through the line to bisect extra cover and mid-off"
10.2,"Sandeep to Tewatia, no run",diving stop at midwicket. Length ball whipped firmly across the angle but Hooda's right hand sticks out and stop this
10.1,"Sandeep to Iyer, 1 run","length ball on off, and he prods forward to drive. Through to long-on for a single"
9.6,"M Nabi to Tewatia, no run","appeal for lbw but not given! Nabi can't believe it. Slider from around the wicket, landing on middle, and going straight through. Skids on, doesn't take anything off the bat, and hits the inside of his front leg. Sunrisers review and replays show that the ball is clipping the outside of leg stump. Tewatia survives, marginally, because that's umpire's call on review"

9.1,"M Nabi to Pant, OUT","full outside off, and Pant tries to clear the boundary. Lifts this inside-out over the off side, but Pant hasn't generated enough power. In the air for ages, and Hooda at long-off times his jump perfectly. How often have we seen a wicket first ball after a break. Pant is not happy at all"
8.6,"Sandeep to Pant, 1 run","length ball on middle, and gently tapped into the vacant region near midwicket. Sandeep gives the ball a chase to stop the second run, and does so successfully. Timeout"
8.5,"Sandeep to Pant, no run","slower ball again, full outside off, forcing Pant to reach at it. Looks to lift this inside-out over cove, but he doesn't pick the knuckle ball well. Ball stays very low"

7.3,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, no run","half-tracker, wide outside off, but straightening after pitching. Tapped off the back foot, straight back to Rashid"
7.2,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, no run","length ball on off, and the wrong'un spins inwards. Iyer makes room to cut, but the ball follows him. Mistimed to point"

5.6,"M Nabi to S Dhawan, OUT","Dhawan falls off the last delivery of the Powerplay! Tossed up on off, turning away from Dhawan, and his attempted sweep has taken a top-edge. Easiest of catches for short fine leg as the Powerplay comes to an end"

19.3,"Pandya to Thakur, FOUR runs","he's ending with a flourish at least, ensuring the damage to the net run-rate is minimal. length ball on off and clobbered through extra cover for a well struck boundary"
19.2,"Pandya to Thakur, SIX runs","gets it off the toe-end of the bat but manages to hit it just beyond the straight boundary. Full ball on off, free swing of the bat. Doesn't get the timing at all, but just got enough on it for it to carry"
19.1,"Pandya to Chahar, OUT","caught at fine leg Chahar was backing away again, this was another back of length ball that followed him. He made contact this time though and got a top edge.

17.2,"Malinga to Chahar, 1 run","starts with a yorker on the stumps, that Chahar gets behind and carefully turns to square leg"
17.1,"Malinga to Jadhav, OUT","and that might be that for CSK's faint hopes. slower ball on the fourth stump, Jadhav wanted to send it to downtown Mumbai, stepping away and swinging mightily, but he can only feather a snick through to the keeper"
16.6,"Bumrah to Jadhav, 1 leg bye","moving across the stumps, Bumrah bowls a quick one that nips in a touch flicks his pad and goes past the keeper. But they've been keeping the third man and fine leg very fine for Jadhav, so third man is able to run across and field it"
16.5,"Bumrah to Bravo, 1 run","back of a length, mistimed pull to midwicket"
16.4,"Bumrah to Bravo, no run","sharp bouncer. It was banged in and moving in, Bravo was moving away to give himself room, the ball followed him. went for the hook with eyes off the ball and it whistled past his helmet"
16.3,"Bumrah to Jadhav, 1 run","good length outside off, steered to third man"

15.5,"Malinga to Jadhav, 1 run","making room to drive though off, but gets a thick outside edge that goes fine. Third man is fine too though, so no boundary"

6.4,"Bumrah to Jadhav, FOUR runs","Jadhav's having fun here. Goes short now, in the fourth-stump corridor, and Jadhav leans back and uses the pace and bounce to ramp it nice and fine, over the man at wide-ish slip. Third man's too square to even dream of stopping this"

4.6,"Behrendorff to Raina, OUT","Kieron Pollard, what a catch that is! He seems to pull off one or two of these every season, doesn't he? He's stationed a few yards in on the point boundary, and Raina makes a bit of room and slaps this off-stump length ball ferociously in his direction. It's travelling at high pace, and it's over his head, and by the time he jumps up and catches it, right arm fully stretched over his head, the ball is almost behind him.

4.1,"Behrendorff to Raina, no run","shortish, fifth-stump line, and Raina is all over the place with his feet, on the move and in midair while trying to stab it away to third man. Doesn't get any bat on it in the end, beaten by pace and bounce"
3.6,"Malinga to Jadhav, FOUR runs","this is poor bowling with fine leg inside the circle. Again it's full and on the pads, and Jadhav flicks it over the leaping fielder at short fine"
3.5,"Malinga to Jadhav, no run","length ball, a bit of late swing away from off stump. Wanted to clip this through the leg side initially, held his shape and adjusted to play it to mid-off"
3.4,"Malinga to Jadhav, SIX runs","full, too straight, and Jadhav has timed that beautifully. Flicks it off his legs, up and over backward square leg"
3.3,"Malinga to Raina, 1 run","yorker, close to leg stump, flicked to the left of deep backward square leg. There was a chance of a second but both batsmen hesitated while turning and the chance went away"
3.2,"Malinga to Raina, no run","back of a length, slanting away into the fifth-stump channel. Jumps across to dab to backward point"
3.1,"Malinga to Raina, no run","length ball, angling away from off stump. presses forward to defend, plays a bit early, off the inside edge towards midwicket"
2.6,"Behrendorff to Jadhav, no run","back of a length, closer to off stump, defended towards point"
2.5,"Behrendorff to Jadhav, no run","back of a length, pitching within the stumps and angling away from left-arm over. Left alone"
2.4,"Behrendorff to Raina, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, shuffles across and clips to the left of square leg"
2.3,"Behrendorff to Raina, no run","length ball angling into middle stump, stays back and clips to midwicket"
2.2,"Behrendorff to Raina, SIX runs","typical Raina. Back of a length outside off, and Raina creates some extra room and carves it away, high over cover"
2.2,"Behrendorff to Raina, 1 wide","short, angling down leg, Raina hops across to try and tuck it fine off his hip, but can't make contact"
2.1,"Behrendorff to Raina, no run","back of a length, rising up steeply over middle and leg, hops up to tuck it towards square leg"
1.6,"Malinga to Jadhav, no run","short again, close to off stump, hops up to ride the bounce and defend towards mid-on"
1.5,"Malinga to Jadhav, no run","shortish, curving away into the fourth-stump channel. Defended towards point"
1.4,"Malinga to Jadhav, no run","massive bounce from a pretty full length outside off, and that late outswing too. Wise decision from Jadhav to leave it"
1.3,"Malinga to Jadhav, no run","length ball curving away outside off, left alone"
1.2,"Malinga to Watson, OUT","short, wide, slapped, and straight to Pollard! It was there to be slapped away, alright, but he picked out the fielder at point. Anyone else, and it would have comfortably cleared the fielder, but Pollard times his jump well and doesn't even have to reach too far overhead to catch it"
1.1,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR runs","just short of a good length, fifth-stump line. Watson looks to hit it over mid-off, and the late outswing causes him to edge thickly and over slip's head"
1.1,"Malinga to Watson, (no ball)","now it's Malinga's turn to get a bit of swing in the air and a lot of bounce off the wicket. Short outside off, and the bounce beats Watson's slash. And he's overstepped too"
0.6,"Behrendorff to Raina, no run","squared up, huge appeal for caught behind, not given, not reviewed. Unplayable delivery again, angling in, hitting that short-of-good length, and straightening from even closer to off stump, and Raina is spun around in midair as he looks to defend"
0.5,"Behrendorff to Raina, no run","and he's bowling like he has a red ball in his hand. Back of a length, angling in and straightening away in the fourth-stump channel. Raina is on the hop and looking to defend and the ball beats his outside edge"
0.4,"Behrendorff to Rayudu, OUT","got him, there's the bounce I spoke about! Takes off from a length as it slants away into the fifth-stump corridor, and Rayudu, getting on the front foot to defend, ends up nicking to the keeper off the shoulder of his bat. First-ball duck for him"
0.3,"Behrendorff to Watson, 1 run","fuller now, angling away from off stump. Looks for the lofted hit over mid-off, ends up slicing it in the air, and on the bounce, to third man"
0.2,"Behrendorff to Watson, no run","back of a length, closer to off stump this time, punched crisply to backward point"
0.1,"Behrendorff to Watson, no run","back of a length, slanting away with steep bounce outside off, left alone"
19.6,"Bravo to Pandya, SIX runs",incredible finish by Hardik full outside off and he goes low and slashes it - the timing is so good on it again that it flies all the way over third man. 29 runs off the final over
19.5,"Bravo to Pandya, FOUR runs","full outside off and Hardik punch-drives it by opening the face, such great connection that it flies to the extra cover fence"
19.4,"Bravo to Pandya, SIX runs","helicoptered into the top tier this is some finish by Mumbai. Yorker on the stumps and Hardik goes deep in his crease and pulls out the helicopter, giving Dhoni a great view behind the stumps, and smashes it over cow corner"
19.3,"Bravo to Pollard, 3 runs","bouncer for the free hit, pulled from outside off. Gets more height than distance and Deepak Chahar at midwicket drops it. Wouldn't have been out, but concedes an extra run with that drop"
19.3,"Bravo to Pollard, (no ball) SIX runs","no-ball for height that's gone the distance slipped out of Bravo's hands and above waist full toss. Pollard slaughters it, sends it soaring over the fence over square leg"
19.2,"Bravo to Pandya, 1 run","yorker on fifth stump, squirted to third man"
19.2,"Bravo to Pandya, 1 wide","strays very far down leg, perhaps he was expecting the batsman to give himself room. Ends up as a wide"
19.1,"Bravo to Pollard, 1 run","yorker at 139 kph, helicoptered off his toes to long-on"
18.6,"Thakur to Pollard, 1 run","full toss on the stumps, flicked to deep midwicket"
18.5,"Thakur to Pollard, SIX runs","walloped too short again and not far enough outside off, Pollard's powerful forearms to the fore as he short-arm jabs it well over long-on"
18.5,"Thakur to Pollard, 1 wide","that's a wide again, too far down legside"
18.4,"Thakur to Pollard, no run","gets the line right that time, just inside the tram line. Pollard stays rooted to his crease and tries to slam it through the offside, but is forced to reach for it and doesn't connect."
18.3,"Thakur to Pollard, no run","follows it with a bouncer that Pollard ducks under. Well directed, just over his shoulder and not a wide"
18.3,"Thakur to Pollard, 1 wide","goes for the wide yorker, but just beyond the tram lines and he'll have to bowl it again"
18.2,"Thakur to Pandya, 1 run","yorker length on the fourth stump line, slashed to point. They were thinking of a second because Dhoni fumbled the ball, but Dhoni ran back down the length of the pitch and forced Hardik to turn back and scramble for his crease. Dhoni under-arms to the stumps but misses, but Hardik would have made his ground. Smiles all around"
18.1,"Thakur to Pandya, SIX runs","get that ball a visa because it's travelling out of here too short and Hardik just stands in his crease, transfers weight back and wallops it waaaaay into the square leg stands"
17.6,"Bravo to Yadav, OUT","and he's holed out to Jadeja at long-on this time. A slight shimmy down the track and this was another normal pace delivery, Suryakumar wanted to go over cow corner, ends up with a leading edge that Jadeja settles under"
17.5,"Bravo to Yadav, FOUR runs","flat bats it straight past the bowler and into the fence. Just misses the yorker, and Surya has drilled it back so straight and so well that it beats even Jadeja's drive"
17.4,"Bravo to Yadav, no run","ther's the slower one, and it's just 92 kph on the fifth stump line. Surya was giving himself room and trying to go over extra cover, misses it completely."
17.3,"Bravo to Pandya, 1 run","very full and normal pace again, he's keeping the batsmen guessing. Full on yorker length, Hardik flicks it fine from between his legs"
17.2,"Bravo to Pandya, no run","well bowled he's got a reputation for bowling slower balls, so what does he do? He bowls a sharp bouncer, and Hardik is very late to spot that, bails out of the shot"
17.1,"Bravo to Yadav, 1 run","very full again, at normal pace this one, driven off his toes to long-on"
16.6,"Sharma to Yadav, 1 run","too full and driven back straight, but there's a long-on so he'll only get a single"
16.5,"Sharma to Yadav, SIX runs",bang pick up sweep from outside off and he absolutely nails it. Sweet sound off the bat and the ball screams through the air and deep into the square leg stands
16.4,"Sharma to Krunal, OUT","he's holed out to long off Krunal's luck has finally run out. Went for another big heave over the off side but got a leading edge that flew high in the air. Jadeja was settling under it and even though the ball was swirling and he had to lunge at the end, he was never letting it go"
16.3,"Sharma to Krunal, FOUR runs",just over Watson's head at cover. Krunal should buy a lottery ticket today punch-driven powerfully and Watson jumped up. Was mighty close to his fingertips but goes over and into the fence
16.2,"Sharma to Krunal, FOUR runs","just over Jadhav at short third man full outside off, it flies off the outside edge with his attempted drive going nowhere, and Jadhav is running back to try and latch on but the ball not only evades him, it beats him to the fence"
16.1,"Sharma to Yadav, 1 run","back of a length outside off, he pulls it from there, but without timing, bounces to deep midwicket"
15.6,"Bravo to Yadav, 1 run","full again, squirted past point"
15.5,"Bravo to Krunal, 1 run","ugly swipe across the line to this slower ball, on a length on middle and leg. The ball loops up off the top edge but lands safe, well in front of deep midwicket"
15.4,"Bravo to Krunal, 2 runs","very full, low full toss, drilled back straight past the bowler. Jadeja runs quickly from long-off and cuts it off, but almost mis-fields. Recovers quickly and picks up the ball to fire the throw back in"
15.3,"Bravo to Yadav, 1 run","slower ball on fifth stump, he has a swipe at it, sends it along the ground to deep midwicket"
15.2,"Bravo to Yadav, FOUR runs","oh that's nicely done. was backing away to give himself room, the bowler followed him, but he opened the face from close to his body and steered it wide of short third man. The length was too short, allowed him to adjust"
15.1,"Bravo to Krunal, 1 run",too full and flicked off his toes between long-on and deep midwicket
14.6,"Tahir to Krunal, 1 run","direct hit run out missed? swiped to Raina again, and they take the quick single. He had time to line up the stumps and let loose, but misses and I think Krunal would have been out despite a dive. Oh and replays show he would have just made it."
14.5,"Tahir to Krunal, no run","quicker ball, drags it too short, and Krunal rocks back to pull powerfully but Raina at midwicket fields it by getting body behind ball"
14.4,"Tahir to Yadav, 1 run","full toss, drifts on the pads, whipped to long-on"
14.3,"Tahir to Krunal, 1 run",driven to long-off
14.2,"Tahir to Krunal, SIX runs","breaks the shackles Krunal was getting tied down, this time he just decided to free his arms. A little slower on the stumps but a touch too full and he clears his front leg and has a big swing to send it well over long-on"
14.1,"Tahir to Krunal, 2 runs",strays on leg stump and is swept to fine leg for a couple
13.6,"Thakur to Krunal, 1 run",goes across and works this to deep square leg from middle stump. And we'll have a strategic time-out
13.5,"Thakur to Krunal, no run","angled into the batsman, almost yorker length, he goes deep in his crease and flicks it to short midwicket"
13.4,"Thakur to Yadav, 1 run",driven between cover and point with an open bat face
13.3,"Thakur to Krunal, 1 run","goes around the wicket and strays on the pads, is picked off to deep square leg"
13.2,"Thakur to Krunal, no run","trapped him in front and the finger's gone up but the batsman has chosen to review. And the replays show why! inside edge onto pad. Length ball that was moving in a touch from outside off, Krunal pushed at it and got a thin edge onto pad, which is the only thing that's saved him, because otherwise that was crashing into the stumps"
13.1,"Thakur to Yadav, 1 run",drilled back straight but Shardul has time to get down and parry it with his right hand and keep the batsmen down to just a single
12.6,"Bravo to Yadav, 1 run","full on the stumps, clipped off his toes to midwicket"
12.5,"Bravo to Krunal, 1 run","slashed off a thick outside edge, once bounce to third man, who almost fumbles it but recovers in time"
12.4,"Bravo to Krunal, no run","dropped by Mohit at mid-off that was as easy a catch as you can get, he drove it off the toe end straight to the fielder. He tried to grab at it too early perhaps, in and out of his hands. Bravo is not happy"
12.3,"Bravo to Yadav, 1 run","rolled his fingers over that one again, 115 kph. On a length outside off, pushed towards cover-point"
12.2,"Bravo to Yadav, no run","slower ball, length on the fourth stump line, he checks his punch back to the bowler"
12.1,"Bravo to Krunal, 1 run","length ball on the stumps, punched to deep midwicket off the back foot"
11.6,"Sharma to Krunal, 1 run","length ball, punched back past the bowler"
11.5,"Sharma to Krunal, FOUR runs","that's a pull shot hit hard enough for Rayudu to concede a four despite being behind the ball at deep square leg. Dragged it down a bit and Krunal latched on to it, Rayudu wanted to stop the ball on the bounce, but was on the edge of the boundary and over-stepped while in contact with the ball"
11.4,"Sharma to Krunal, FOUR runs","went over the top, didn't time it all that well but meaty enough to clear the in-field, which is all he needed because there's no long-off. Full outside off, the bat turned a bit in his hands"
11.3,"Sharma to Krunal, no run","length ball outside off, driven to cover, but not timed well enough"
11.2,"Sharma to Krunal, no run","gets it wider that time outside off, and Krunal throws his bat at it, trying to drive, but inside edges to short midwicket"
11.1,"Sharma to Yadav, 1 run",nice looking straight drive to a slower ball on leg stump. He didn't try to hit it too hard though and long-on comes around to collect
10.6,"Tahir to Yadav, 1 run","drags it a little short again, whipped off his pads to deep midwicket"
10.5,"Tahir to Krunal, 1 run","keeps it very full on the stumps again, Krunal drives from the crease to long-off"
10.4,"Tahir to Yadav, 1 run","fuller length outside off, driven to long-off"
10.3,"Tahir to Yadav, no run","tossed up, ends as a full toss and driven to cover"
10.2,"Tahir to Yadav, FOUR runs","too short and he spotted it early, went down and swept it fine. Tahir went for the quicker one but lost his length"
10.1,"Tahir to Yadav, no run","full on the stumps, pushed back down the pitch"
9.6,"Jadeja to Krunal, 2 runs","back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face to steer it to the right of backward point"
9.5,"Jadeja to Krunal, FOUR runs","the pace on the ball has been his friend so far. Now Krunal turns it into his foe. Quickish length ball pitching just outside off, and that's fast hands to reverse-paddle it between keeper and short third man"
9.4,"Jadeja to Krunal, no run","fired in flat at middle stump, a little fuller. Stays back because of the trajectory and clips to midwicket"
9.3,"Jadeja to Krunal, no run","flat, pushed through on off stump, clipped with the turn to midwicket"
9.2,"Jadeja to Krunal, no run","length ball outside off, defended to short extra"
9.1,"Jadeja to Yadav, 1 run","full, angling into middle and leg, driven inside-out to long-off"
8.6,"Tahir to Krunal, no run","quickish length ball on middle and leg, gets his front pad out of the way to defend back to the bowler"
8.5,"Tahir to Krunal, no run","flighted ball on off stump, driven back to the bowler"
8.4,"Tahir to Krunal, no run","tossed up, angling away from off stump, gets on the front foot to defend into the covers"
8.3,"Tahir to Yuvraj, OUT","gone! That looked like a clean strike from Yuvraj, and it was, the lofted drive against the full ball on off stump. Frees his arms and it looks like vintage Yuvraj, but long-off is back on the boundary, and Rayudu takes it with both hands, over his head, and even though he's stepping backwards as he takes it he doesn't get too close to the rope. They check a few times anyway, from multiple angles"
8.2,"Tahir to Yuvraj, 2 runs","shortish on leg stump, pulled to the left of deep square leg"
8.1,"Tahir to Yuvraj, no run","lovely. Quickish length ball, angled across, pitching on about off stump, and Yuvraj isn't sure which way it's turning as he stretches out to defend. It's the googly, and it slides past his outside edge"
7.6,"Jadeja to Yuvraj, 1 run","back of a length, a bit of width, chopped down towards backward point, where Thakur misfields and allows the single, and then nearly concedes overthrows at the striker's end. Thankfully for him, the fielder at deep square leg is alert to the possibility and has backed up well"
7.5,"Jadeja to Yuvraj, no run","flat length ball close to off stump, Yuvraj stretches out and blocks watchfully"
7.4,"Jadeja to Yadav, 1 run","back of a length, comes in with the angle towards middle and leg. Punched to long-on"
7.3,"Jadeja to Yadav, no run","full now, on off stump, driven to short extra-cover"
7.2,"Jadeja to Yuvraj, 1 run","flat length ball outside off, presses forward to defend, squeezes it into the gap to the right of short extra-cover"
7.1,"Jadeja to Rohit Sharma, OUT","is that an edge? Dhoni thinks so, and Rohit trudges off. Typical Jadeja wicket, a flat length ball just outside off stump, and it rips away sharply off the pitch as Rohit looks to drive through the covers with an angled bat. They're checking for Jadeja's front foot. He always seems to be on the verge of overstepping while delivering, but usually pulls his leg back so that his heel's behind the crease when the foot lands, even if it's in the air. Looks to be the case here too"
6.6,"Tahir to Yadav, no run","nice flight and dip outside off. A legbreak with more overspin than sidespin, and Suryakumar plays a checked drive back to the bowler"
6.5,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length ball, wide-ish line, not much turn. Opens his bat face to steer to deep point"
6.4,"Tahir to Yadav, 1 run","tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
6.3,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","back of a length, goes on straight towards off stump, lets it come on and works it to deep midwicket"
6.2,"Tahir to Yadav, 1 run","another googly, fuller this time, on off stump, clipped to long-on"
6.1,"Tahir to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","wrong'un turning towards off stump, driven to long-off off the front foot"
5.6,"Sharma to Yadav, no run","back of a length outside off, finds some away movement off the deck  to beat Suryakumar's attempted dab to third man"
5.5,"Sharma to Yadav, no run","back-of-the-hand delivery, back of a length and it bounces up a little extra towards off stump. Pulls without too much power to midwicket"
5.4,"Sharma to Yadav, no run","length ball, fourth-stump line, big stride forward to block to mid-off"
5.3,"Sharma to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, clipped away to deep square leg"
5.2,"Sharma to Rohit Sharma, no run","back of a length outside off, punched into the cover point region"
5.1,"Sharma to Rohit Sharma, no run","back of a length, delivers from extremely close to the stumps and cuts down any angle the batsman can work with by bowling a tight off-stump line. A bit of inward movement too, clipped to midwicket"
4.6,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and drops it into the cover point region with soft hands"
4.5,"Chahar to Yadav, 1 run","back of a length, slower offcutter nipping in towards the thigh pad. Tucked away to fine leg"
4.4,"Chahar to Yadav, FOUR runs","back of a length, too straight, and that's clipped away crisply off the pads to the left of midwicket. Met it with a straight bat and didn't really need to close the face at all. Classy shot"
4.3,"Chahar to Yadav, FOUR runs","back of a length, angling into the stumps, punched to the right of mid-on, where Rayudu throws himself at the ball but can only get his fingertips to it. Slows it down a little, but not enough to prevent four even with a lung-busting chase to the boundary"
4.2,"Chahar to Yadav, FOUR runs","back of a length outside off, and there's a huge gap between cover, who's on the edge of the circle, and mid-off, who's stationed very straight. Suryakumar stands tall and punches it away through that gap"
4.1,"Chahar to Yadav, no run","shortish outside off, stops on the pitch a little. Jumps up to slap it, without too much power, into the cover point region"
3.6,"Thakur to Yadav, 1 run","back of a length on middle stump, worked away to the left of fine leg"
3.5,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","slower length ball outside off, punched to the right of Jadhav at cover"
3.5,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","short, angling a long way down leg. Rohit can't connect with the pull"
3.4,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","too much width, way too much width, and Rohit plays a front-foot slap that flies away between point and backward point"
3.3,"Thakur to Yadav, 1 run","short, angling into the batsman's hip. Swivels to pull to fine leg"
3.2,"Thakur to Yadav, FOUR runs","shot! Even better than the previous one. Fullish, angling in towards middle stump, and he keeps his front leg out of the way and is perfectly balanced as he shows the full face and drives to the left of mid-on"
3.1,"Thakur to Yadav, FOUR runs","fullish outside off, and this is not just a bouncy pitch but a bouncy square too. Suryakumar plays a checked drive, into the turf, and it bounces up over the leaping cover fielder"
2.6,"Chahar to Yadav, 1 run","shortish, gets some extra bounce along the fifth-stump channel. Don't know what Suryakumar was trying to do there, trapped between playing and leaving I guess. Jabs at it and gets a thick outside edge that runs down to third man"
2.5,"Chahar to Yadav, no run","back of a length on off stump, defended towards mid-off"
2.4,"Chahar to Yadav, no run","back of a length close to off stump, punched to cover"
2.3,"Chahar to de Kock, OUT","got him, Chahar gets the early breakthrough. Takes a premeditated step out of his crease, which turns this short ball into one that isn't quite short enough to pull. He gets cramped a little, and ends up swiping it at catchable height, just over Jadhav's left shoulder, to square leg"
2.2,"Chahar to de Kock, FOUR runs","first boundary of the day, not too convincing. Back of a length, nips back in from outside off, and de Kock goes for a half-front-foot jab, aiming to hit through cover point. Ends up inside-edging it past his off stump instead"
2.1,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","back of a length, a bit of nip in towards leg stump. Tucked away towards square leg, where Shardul, sprinting to his right and diving, misfields to allow a single"
1.6,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length ball on off stump, gets on the front foot to push into the gap between extra-cover and cover point"
1.5,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, no run","full, late swing to straighten the ball towards off stump. Shows the full face to punch to mid-off"
1.4,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, no run","nicely bowled. Shifts his line wider, but this one isn't quite as full. Goes for the flat-bat drive and is defeated by outswing and bounce"
1.3,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, no run","length ball, a little wider, presses forward to push towards cover point"
1.2,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, no run","ooh, swing for Thakur too. Beautiful traditional good length, angling into the fourth-stump line and swinging away in a pronounced manner. Rohit doesn't really get forward, just pushes at the drive, aiming towards mid-off, and the ball curves past his outside edge"
1.1,"Thakur to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on off stump, clipped to midwicket"
0.6,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length ball angling in towards off stump, gets on the front foot to clip it watchfully through midwicket"
0.5,"Chahar to de Kock, 1 leg bye","back of a length, and this one nips back into de Kock from a middle-and-leg line with extra bounce. Hurriedly looks to whip it away into the leg side and misses, the ball hits him on the hip"

0.3,"Chahar to de Kock, no run","back of a length, fourth-stump line, jabbed to point"
0.2,"Chahar to de Kock, no run","fuller, wider outside off, left alone"
0.1,"Chahar to de Kock, no run","ooh, beauty. Back of a length, angling across the left-hander. Pitches on about middle and leg and nips away off the seam to open de Kock up in defence and beat the outside edge"
19.5,"Yadav to Tripathi, SIX runs","pulled for six! What a way to win the game. Length ball on off, and Tripathi absolutely hammers this over deep midwicket. Royals win by 7 wickets"
19.4,"Yadav to Stokes, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and the attempted cut has gone to point's right. Negi gives to stop the ball, but they can't stop the single"
19.3,"Yadav to Stokes, no run","length ball on middle, and he taps this to short midwicket. Dot ball!"
19.2,"Yadav to Tripathi, 1 run","back of a length just outside off, and he clubs an attempted pull off his glove. Ball rolls away to short fine leg"
19.1,"Yadav to Tripathi, 2 runs","back of a length on off, and the pull along the ground finds deep backward square. Enough time to take the second"
18.6,"Siraj to Smith, OUT","full, just outside off, and Smith has hammered this off the back foot. Over the non-striker's head, but the man at long on is there. Smith falls, Royals need 5 off the final over"
18.5,"Siraj to Tripathi, 1 run","another drop! Look ma, no hands in real life from the RCB fielders. Short on off, and the pull is top-edged to the leg side. Moeen runs in from deep backward square to take a catch, but he slides along the grass and the ball pops out of his hand. Oh dear"
18.4,"Siraj to Smith, 1 run","back of a length, wide outside off, and the attempted pull nearly goes straight to midwicket! Pawan Negi drops a tough chance diving forward"
18.3,"Siraj to Smith, no run","back of a length, wide outside off, and Smith flat-bats a shot straight back to Siraj"
18.2,"Siraj to Tripathi, 1 run","length ball on middle, and angling into his ribcage. Pulled to deep backward square for one"
18.1,"Siraj to Smith, 1 run","back of a length on off, and pulled off the back foot to deep midwicket"
17.6,"Saini to Tripathi, no run","goes for the yorker, but Tripathi gives the bowler a chase, effectively turning it into a low full toss. Mistimed back to the bowler"
17.5,"Saini to Tripathi, no run","back of a length on middle, and his attempted pull goes to midwicket on the bounce. AB picks up and has a shy at the bowler's end, but can't get the direct hit"
17.4,"Saini to Tripathi, FOUR runs","full toss on middle, and Tripathi backs away to make room. Fast hands from Tripathi makes him slice a square-cut, and that's been struck past third man for four"
17.4,"Saini to Tripathi, 1 wide","fast! Back of a length on middle, and angling down the leg side. Tripathi ducks under it, happily"
17.3,"Saini to Smith, 1 run","back of a length on off, and the ball hurries onto Smith. Mistimes a pull, but it lands safely near square leg. Nobody there"
17.2,"Saini to Smith, 2 runs","full on off, and he swings across the line to hammer a leg-side swipe to deep midwicket"
17.1,"Saini to Tripathi, 1 run","back of a length on off, and he flat-bats a pull to long on for a single"
16.6,"Siraj to Smith, SIX runs","clobbered over cow corner! Slower ball, full outside off, and Smith has given this an absolute hammering. Stays on the back foot, sees the ball come to him, and then absolutely swings the bat as if it's a katana. Beautiful sound off the bat, and the ball soars into the stands"
16.5,"Siraj to Smith, 2 runs","full, just outside off, and he slaps a square drive to deep extra cover"
16.5,"Siraj to Smith, 1 wide","slower ball, really wide outside off, and Smith gives the ball a chase. Tries to muscle a cut through point, but misses. Umpire Erasmus calls it a wide though"
16.4,"Siraj to Tripathi, 1 run","length ball on off, and angling in. He mistimes a flick towards the leg side, ball rolls away to square leg"
16.3,"Siraj to Tripathi, no run","back of a length on off, and the extra bounce takes it over Tripathi's shoulders. He reckons it should be a wide, but the umpires disagree"
16.2,"Siraj to Tripathi, 2 runs","falls in front of Stoinis! Full and wide outside off, and Tripathi tries to slice an uppish drive to the point boundary. In the air for a while as Stoinis runs in, but the ball falls just in front of him"
16.1,"Siraj to Tripathi, FOUR runs","classy! Full, wide outside off, and Tripathi prods forward to meet the ball on the up. Firmly struck over cover, Tripathi holds his pose after playing that"
15.6,"Chahal to Tripathi, 1 run","full on leg, and he goes down on one knee to sweep. Hit to fine leg. A solid spell from Chahal comes to an end, but it's likely going to be in another losing cause"
15.5,"Chahal to Tripathi, no run","full on leg, and Tripathi walks down the ground to drive. Hit uppishly, and the ball lands just in front of Chahal. Nearly carried all the way"
15.4,"Chahal to Smith, 1 run","full on middle, and he drives down the ground to long off for a single"
15.3,"Chahal to Tripathi, 1 run","length ball on middle, and the googly is flicked off his pads to deep backward square"
15.2,"Chahal to Tripathi, no run","full on middle, and turning across Tripathi. Defended"
15.1,"Chahal to Smith, 1 run","flighted full outside off, and turning away from him. Smith lifts it over cover, and the ball's in the air for a really long time, but the ball pops out of Umesh Yadav's hand at extra cover! Dropped. One of the easiest catches you'll find on the cricket field"
14.6,"Stoinis to Smith, 1 run","full on off, and he uses his wrists to whip this down to the leg-side boundary. Royals need 38 off 30 as we take another timeout"
14.5,"Stoinis to Smith, 2 runs","length ball, just outside off, and Smith pulls off the back foot to deep midwicket. It's off the bat's toe end, so the lack of pace actually helps Royals collect the second"
14.4,"Stoinis to Tripathi, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and he opens the bat's face to run this down to third man again"
14.3,"Stoinis to Smith, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off, and he sticks his bat out to guide a late-cut to third man"
14.2,"Stoinis to Tripathi, 1 run","back of a length on off, and he mistimes a pull to deep backward square. They jog across for one"
14.1,"Stoinis to Tripathi, FOUR runs","back of a length on middle, and he stays on the back foot. Then turns his chest, and thumps a pulled-shot over midwicket"
13.6,"Yadav to Smith, no run","full on middle, and he uses his wrists to play an on-drive towards midwicket. Can't beat the fielder though"
13.5,"Yadav to Smith, no run","fullish just outside off, and Smith reaches forward to defend. Lobs off his bat's top half, but lands safely in front of cover"
13.4,"Yadav to Smith, FOUR runs","edged past the keeper! But this was deliberately played. Length ball outside off, and with no slip cordon Smith opens the bat's face to play a punch. Flies off the bat's face and into the third-man boundary"
13.3,"Yadav to Tripathi, 1 run","length ball on middle, and flicked off his pads down to fine leg. Just a single this time"
13.2,"Yadav to Tripathi, 2 runs","length ball on off, and worked off his pads to deep midwicket. Tripathi wants the second, and Stoinis' misfield at the deep doesn't help RCB's cause either"
13.1,"Yadav to Tripathi, no run","back of a length on off, and the ball's gone over Tripathi's shoulders even before he can shape up to pull"
12.6,"Chahal to Smith, no run","beautiful delivery! Classical legbreak. Full outside off, and turning away from Smith. Smith tries to drive inside-out, but the ball goes past his bat. Nath whips the bails off, and is Smith's back foot in the air? Nope"
12.5,"Chahal to Smith, no run","full on off, and defended towards the on-side"
12.4,"Chahal to Buttler, OUT","toe-ended to long off! Full, just outside off, and the extra legbreak finds the bat's bottom-half. Slices it into the air, and Stoinis makes no mistake. Buttler very disappointed, hits his bat onto the ground in disgust"
12.3,"Chahal to Smith, 1 run","full on middle, and the googly is met by Smith after coming down the wicket. Looks to whip it away to the leg side, but the ball goes fine behind square"
12.2,"Chahal to Smith, no run","full on middle, and driven down the ground with the bat's open face to cover"
12.1,"Chahal to Buttler, 1 run","length ball on middle, and he goes deep into his crease, before flicking off his hips to square leg"
12.1,"Chahal to Buttler, 1 wide","full, very wide outside off, and turning further away. Buttler tries to drill this through the covers, but misses"
11.6,"Ali to Smith, 2 runs","full on middle, and nudged in front of square to deep midwicket. They jog across for the double, and bring up the Team hundred"
11.5,"Ali to Buttler, 1 run","full on off, and worked with the turn into the gap at midwicket. They walk across for one"
11.4,"Ali to Buttler, no run","length ball, just outside off, and tapped back to Moeen"
11.3,"Ali to Buttler, SIX runs","insult to injury! Half-tracker on off, turning into Buttler, and he swivels to pull this over cow corner. Crowd goes ballistic"
11.2,"Ali to Buttler, FOUR runs","drilled through the bowler's legs! Glad Moeen didn't get his fingertips to it, in retrospect. Tossed up on off, and Buttler hammers a straight drive through Moeen. Fourth-straight fifty at this ground for Jos"
11.1,"Ali to Smith, 1 run","length ball on off, and Smith walks down the wicket to work it towards the leg side. Leading edge takes it to cover instead"
10.6,"Stoinis to Buttler, no run","full, just outside off, and Buttler walks into a punch. Struck to cover"
10.5,"Stoinis to Buttler, no run","knuckle ball, full on off, and he drills a straight drive past the bowler's left. Stopped at mid-off though"
10.4,"Stoinis to Smith, 1 run","full on middle, but angling into Smith's pads. Whipped away to deep midwicket. Wristy from Smith"
10.3,"Stoinis to Smith, FOUR runs","inside-edged past the keeper! Smith riding his luck. Length ball, just outside off, and he tries to pull. Takes a thick inside-edge and flies past Nath's left"
10.2,"Stoinis to Buttler, 1 run","full on leg, and he clips this away - off his boots - to deep backward square"
10.1,"Stoinis to Smith, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and he slashes a cut to deep point for a single"
9.6,"Chahal to Buttler, 2 runs","wrong'un, Buttler picks it well. Tossed up fairly wide of off and he gets a good stride in, watches it nicely, and plays a checked drive to the left of sweeper cover"
9.5,"Chahal to Buttler, no run","nicely bowled. Dangles it up slow, wide of off stump, and gets it to rip away sharply to beat Buttler's flat-bat cover drive"
9.4,"Chahal to Smith, 1 run","flight again, on leg stump. Good stride forward from Smith to drive to long-on"
9.3,"Chahal to Buttler, 1 run","wrong'un, short enough for Buttler to go back to and work with the spin through midwicket"
9.2,"Chahal to Buttler, 2 runs","flighted ball drops onto a lovely length on middle stump. Closes his bat face early while looking to flick, and the leading edge rolls away into the backward point region. Misfield from the fielder moving to his left allows Buttler to come back for a second"
9.2,"Chahal to Buttler, 1 wide","flat length ball sliding down leg. Buttler loses his balance while missing the flick, but manages to keep his back foot grounded as Nath whips off the bails"
9.1,"Chahal to Smith, 1 run","back of a length, turning from leg to middle, goes on the back foot to punch to long-on"
8.6,"Stoinis to Buttler, FOUR runs","bouncer over off stump, got up to about neck high, and Buttler plays a stunning shot, a horizontal-bat swat over mid-on with both feet off the ground"
8.5,"Stoinis to Smith, 1 run","shortish outside off, keeps a touch low, Smith plays that trademark tennis-style swat to the right of midwicket"
8.4,"Stoinis to Buttler, 1 run","again he shuffles out of his crease and across to the off side. Full one, angling into off stump, clipped through backward square leg"
8.3,"Stoinis to Buttler, FOUR runs","short, angling into middle stump, and Buttler jumps forward and across and uses his incredible bat-speed to swat it away into the gap between deep square leg and fine leg"
8.2,"Stoinis to Buttler, no run","back of a length on off stump, punched to mid-off"
8.1,"Stoinis to Smith, 1 run","back of a length, angling into leg stump, tucked away to fine leg"
7.6,"Chahal to Smith, 1 run","full and flighted on middle and leg, clipped down to long-on"
7.5,"Chahal to Smith, no run","tossed up outside off, looks like another wrong'un, uses his wrists to play that back to the bowler"
7.4,"Chahal to Rahane, OUT","given! The wrong'un continues to do its magic! Rocks back to cut, completely misreads the googly, and by the time his bat can come down the ball has struck the flap of his back pad, bang in front. May have misread the length as well - it didn't seem short enough to cut, and that misjudgment left him with even less time to adjust"
7.3,"Chahal to Rahane, no run","tossed up slow again, angling in towards leg stump. Rahane stretches out for the lap-sweep, only gets some glove on it and it bounces down to the keeper"
7.2,"Chahal to Buttler, 1 run",down the track and Chahal floats it up at his feet. Clipped to long-on
7.1,"Chahal to Buttler, no run","back of a length, and it keeps low as it slides along with the angle, towards middle stump. Ensures he plays with a straight bat and keeps it out, punches it back to the bowler"
6.6,"Siraj to Buttler, 1 run","short, a bit of width, taps it away on top of the bounce for a single to deep point"
6.5,"Siraj to Buttler, no run","well bowled. Buttler looks to make room premeditatedly, and Siraj sends down a fast yorker and nearly takes out off stump as Buttler jams his bat down hard and fails to make contact"
6.4,"Siraj to Buttler, no run","back of a length, angling in towards off and middle, blocked to midwicket"
6.3,"Siraj to Buttler, no run","full on middle stump, punched to midwicket"
6.2,"Siraj to Buttler, 2 runs","short outside off, and Buttler swats it away, in the air to the right of midwicket, and deep square leg has to run aroind a long way"
6.1,"Siraj to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length outside off, lets it come on and guides it to third man"
5.6,"Saini to Rahane, 1 run","full, angling into a fourth-stump line. Clips it to the left of mid-on and they take a fairly comfortable single, even though there's a direct hit at the bowler's end"
5.5,"Saini to Rahane, FOUR runs","full, too much width, and Rahane frees his arms and lofts it over extra-cover, such clean timing"
5.4,"Saini to Rahane, no run","shortish, rises stomach-high over middle stump. Cramps him on the pull and the ball sneaks under his bat and hits him on the body"
5.3,"Saini to Rahane, FOUR runs","shot. He wagered that the ball would be similar to the previous one, fullish, and just outside off stump. Took a big step across and used his wrists to whip it stylishly to the right of mid-on"
5.2,"Saini to Rahane, no run","full, close to off stump, Rahane doesn't quite middle the drive and it rolls along towards short extra-cover. A little late getting forward, he seemed to be moving as he played the shot"
5.1,"Saini to Rahane, no run","shortish on off stump, slippery pace again. A little late on that front-foot pull, and the ball rolls to the left of square leg off the high part of the bat, near the sticker"
4.6,"Siraj to Rahane, 1 run","fullish, angling into off stump, Rahane pushes it to mid-on off the front foot, and denies Siraj a maiden"
4.5,"Siraj to Rahane, no run","short and wide, and Rahane would have been better served staying still. Chose to premeditate and make room for the cut, and ended up too far from the line to make contact"
4.4,"Siraj to Rahane, no run","back of a length, a bit of nip back in towards off stump. Stays leg-side of the ball and dabs to backward point"
4.3,"Siraj to Rahane, no run","back of a length, closer to off stump, punched crisply and backward point stops it with a full-length dive to his right. Hetmyer the fielder"
4.2,"Siraj to Rahane, no run","zips past the edge again. This was short and wide, and Rahane was looking for the horizontal-bat slap through point"
4.1,"Siraj to Rahane, no run","back of a length outside off stump, past the outside edge as Rahane goes hard at the back-foot punch"
3.6,"Saini to Buttler, no run","length ball on off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
3.5,"Saini to Buttler, FOUR runs","more runs. Length ball outside off stump and Buttler goes for a hard-hands front-foot push, looking to hit through the covers. Ends up getting a thick edge that runs away between gully and short third man"
3.4,"Saini to Buttler, no run","shortish outside off, perhaps not short enough to pull, sneaks under Buttler's attempted shot"
3.3,"Saini to Buttler, 4 byes","length ball in the corridor, angling in from wider on the crease.  Buttler throws his bat at another angled-bat drive, and the ball zips past his inside edge and Nath, diving to his left behind the stumps, can't keep it from running away for four byes"
3.2,"Saini to Buttler, no run","again that full length, but now he goes a bit wider outside off. Buttler looks to launch it back over the bowler's head, or over mid-off, and he misses. The ball ended up a touch too far out of his reach"
3.1,"Saini to Buttler, FOUR runs","fullish outside off, and that's a fierce hit from Buttler. It's a hit, not a drive. Leans back and flays it away with an angled bat between cover point and extra-cover"
2.6,"Yadav to Rahane, FOUR runs","short, wide, and Rahane rises to his toes to hammer that away to the right of the diving backward point fielder"
2.5,"Yadav to Rahane, FOUR runs","slower ball, ends up horribly off-line. Fairly full, angling down leg, and Rahane tickles it away nice and fine, to the right of the man at short fine leg"
2.4,"Yadav to Buttler, 1 run","short, angling down leg, pulled round to fine leg"
2.3,"Yadav to Buttler, 2 runs","length ball angling into the pads, clipped to the left of fine leg"
2.2,"Yadav to Buttler, 2 runs","shortish, fourth-stump line, pulled away to the left of fine leg"
2.1,"Yadav to Rahane, 1 run","nice-looking shot. Fullish, angling into off stump, smooth drive to the right of mid-off, forces the fielder into a sliding stop"
2.1,"Yadav to Rahane, 1 wide","full, ends up angling this a long way down the leg side. Rahane can't connect with the flick"
1.6,"Saini to Buttler, no run","short, rising chest-high over off stump, jumps to ride the bounce and defend towards midwicket"
1.5,"Saini to Buttler, FOUR runs","low full-toss outside off, and Buttler takes a big step back to give himself more room to swing his arms through a flat-bat slap through the covers"
1.4,"Saini to Buttler, FOUR runs","length ball on off stump, and Buttler shovels it down the ground, up and over the non-striker's head"
1.3,"Saini to Rahane, 1 run","edged, and dropped. Fuller, but not on a driving length, in the corridor, and that's serious pace and bounce. Doesn't have the time to get fully forward to drive and he throws an angled bat at it. Thick edge, and Kohli, diving to his right to take it as it climbs to shoulder height, gets both hands to it but can't hold on. He went a little early at it, and the ball bounced off the heels of his hands"
1.2,"Saini to Buttler, 1 leg bye","shortish, angling into the batsman's left ribcage. Jumps up and looks to work it away, but is a little late on it. The ball rolls off his hip into the short fine leg region"
1.1,"Saini to Buttler, no run","that's some serious pace. 1458kph. Shortish, a fair bit of width, but it zips past Buttler's attempt at a leaden-footed slash"
0.6,"Yadav to Buttler, 1 run","short, wide, slapped firmly but close to cover point and he'll only get a single because the fielder fumbled"
0.5,"Yadav to Buttler, no run","back of a length outside off, punched to extra-cover"
0.4,"Yadav to Buttler, 2 runs","back of a length, closer to off stump, lets it come on and steers to the left of third man"
0.3,"Yadav to Buttler, FOUR runs","no footwork again, but what great eyes and hands. Again on the shorter side, and a bit more width this time. Just stands there and punches it past the left hand of the diving extra-cover fielder"
0.2,"Yadav to Buttler, no run","again that away swing in the fifth-stump channel, short of a good length. Buttler jabs at it without any footwork and is beaten"
0.1,"Yadav to Rahane, 1 run","short outside off, a bit of away swing. Opens his bat face and guides it down to third man"
19.6,"Archer to Stoinis, FOUR runs","ramped over short fine leg! Full toss just outside off, but Stoinis shuffles across and gets enough behind that shot to play it into the fine-leg boundary. Archer concedes 17 off his final over, RCB finish on 158"
19.5,"Archer to Ali, 1 bye","back of a length, short and fast outside off, and Moeen's too slow to pull. Through to the keeper and the batsmen pinch a single"
19.4,"Archer to Ali, FOUR runs","full on off, and he clears his front leg to slog. Struck past the non-striker, and Gowtham - at long on - can't cut it off! RCB go past 150"
19.3,"Archer to Stoinis, 1 run","low full toss, just outside off, and he hammers a straight drive to long off"
19.2,"Archer to Ali, 1 run","full on off, and he backs away to slap a shot to Stokes at deep extra cover"
19.1,"Archer to Ali, SIX runs","clobbered! Flat six over deep midwicket. Length ball, just outside off, and Moeen drags this pull into the stands"
18.6,"Stokes to Stoinis, no run","back of a length, just outside off, and Stoinis looks to pull. Misses, and the ball flies over his blade. Goes into Buttler's gloves, and the English duo of Stokes and Buttler want to review. Rahane's convinced: Royals review. Replays suggest that the ball seems to be going over the blade, and UltraEdge agrees with that too. Not out, Royals lose a review"
18.5,"Stokes to Stoinis, 2 runs","back of a length, slower ball on off, and Stoinis waits for the ball to get to him. Muscles a pull to deep backward square, and it nearly carries all the way to the fielder. Whoops"
18.4,"Stokes to Stoinis, FOUR runs","full on off, and Stoinis uses the long handle to shovel an on-drive past the fielder at wide long on!"
18.3,"Stokes to Ali, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and Moeen tries to pull again. Bat's face closes, and the shot goes towards short fine leg"
18.2,"Stokes to Stoinis, 1 run","back of a length, wide outside off, and Stoinis flat-bats a shot over Stokes' head. Gowtham, committed in the deep, sprints across the long-off fence and intercepts"
18.1,"Stokes to Ali, 1 run","full on leg, and he clears his front leg to slog. Mistimes the shot to deep midwicket. Moeen's looking for the big shots now"
17.6,"Archer to Ali, 1 run","back of a length on off, and he's through his pull too early. Mistimed to the fielder position at midwicket"
17.5,"Archer to Ali, FOUR runs","full on middle, and he tries to smack a drive through the covers. Ball takes an inside edge, goes through Moeen's legs, and splits fine leg and deep backward square. Lucky"
17.4,"Archer to Ali, no run","low full toss on off, and he punches a shot straight back to Archer. Missed opportunity"
17.3,"Archer to Stoinis, 1 run","full just outside off, and he shuffles across the stumps before clipping a shot to deep midwicket"
17.2,"Archer to Patel, OUT","can't clear long on! Slower ball, full outside off, and Parthiv goes for the slog. Doesn't pick the change of pace, and he toe-ends the shot. In the air for quite a while, but Rahane keeps calm"
17.1,"Archer to Stoinis, 1 run","low full toss on middle, and the attempted straight drive takes a leading edge to deep point"
16.6,"Stokes to Patel, FOUR runs","length ball, on off, and he places this pull to wide long on! Excellent shot, beating the fielder there"
16.5,"Stokes to Stoinis, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and he flat-bats a shot straight to Stokes. Ball goes through Stokes' legs, but he manages to get his fingertips to it. Saves a certain four"
16.4,"Stokes to Patel, 1 run","length ball on middle, and angling away from Parthiv. Drags a pull to the vacant midwicket region. Royals won't mind these"
16.3,"Stokes to Stoinis, 1 run","offcutter, wide outside off, and he mistimes a punched shot to long off"
16.2,"Stokes to Stoinis, no run","slower ball, fullish outside off, and Stoinis tries to cut this hard through point. Ball goes over his blade, and into the keeper's gloves"
16.1,"Stokes to Patel, 1 run","back of a length on off, and he rocks back to pull. Mistimes the shot to the man in the deep"
15.6,"Kulkarni to Patel, 1 run","overpitched on leg stump, and Parthiv slaps this through the leg side for a single. Timeout"
15.5,"Kulkarni to Patel, FOUR runs","hammered over cover! Full, wide outside off but Parthiv walks towards the delivery, and slices a drive over the infield"
15.4,"Kulkarni to Patel, 2 runs","offcutter, wide outside off, and Parthiv makes room. Forced to reach out at it, and he toe-ends a cut to cover"
15.3,"Kulkarni to Patel, no run","length ball, just wide outside off, and cut square to deep point"
15.2,"Kulkarni to Patel, 2 runs","full, just outside off, and Parthiv clobbers a cover drive past cover's left. Wide long-off runs around the boundary to intercept"

14.6,"Gopal to Stoinis, 1 run","full, just outside off, and the googly is driven to long off. Gopal finishes on 3-12"
14.5,"Gopal to Stoinis, no run","reverse paddles, but misses! Length ball just outside off, and Stoinis tries to play the reverse paddle past short third man. Inside-edged onto his body"
14.4,"Gopal to Patel, 1 run","another short ball on middle, and Parthiv pulls off the back foot to deep midwicket"
14.3,"Gopal to Stoinis, 1 run","arm ball, but half-tracker on middle. Comfortably worked off his hips to deep midwicket"
14.2,"Gopal to Patel, 1 run","flighted full on middle, and he turns this off his pads to the fielder at square leg. They jog across for one"
14.1,"Gopal to Patel, no run","googly on middle, and turning across the batsman. Tapped off the back foot to Gopal"
13.6,"Archer to Stoinis, no run","fuller, outside off, and Stoinis can't get under this. Driven straight back to Archer"
13.5,"Archer to Stoinis, SIX runs","deposited into orbit! Slower ball, full on off, and Stoinis clears his front leg before drilling a really high six over long-on. People in the stands run for cover"
13.5,"Archer to Patel, (no ball) 1 run","no ball, direct hit, overthrows! Length ball, wide outside off, and he guides to short third man. Fielder from there takes aim at the stumps, and the direct hit at the batsman's end ricochets towards short fine leg. They scamper across for a single, and that's Patel's fifty!"
13.4,"Archer to Patel, no run","full on off, from around the wicket. Parthiv mistimes a front-foot defense back to Archer"

13.1,"Archer to Stoinis, 1 run","full on middle, and he flicks off his toes to deep backward square. Man there"
12.6,"Stokes to Patel, no run","full on middle, and nudged off his pads to the leg side. Pouched by midwicket though"
12.5,"Stokes to Patel, FOUR runs","cut square! Full, just outside off, and he throws his bat at this. Crunches a drive to backward point for four"
12.4,"Stokes to Patel, SIX runs","parried for six! Length ball on leg, and he swivels to pull. Top-edges the shot to Tripathi at deep midwicket, but the ball goes just over him. Tripathi did get fingertips to it, but the ball just about beat him. 100% for effort"
12.3,"Stokes to Stoinis, 1 run","length ball, slower delivery on off and angling in. Worked off his pads to midwicket"
12.2,"Stokes to Stoinis, no run","back of a length, just outside off, and Stoinis stays on the back foot to punch. Finds mid-off however"

11.6,"Binny to Patel, 1 run","full, just outside off, and tapped with soft hands towards cover. They scamper across for one"
11.5,"Binny to Patel, 2 runs","slower ball, outside leg stump, and PP uses his wrists to flick this past the fielder at short fine leg. Dangerous second run, but Parthiv is committed to it. His highest score of the season"
11.4,"Binny to Stoinis, 1 run","length ball, width offered outside off, and he mistimes a square-cut to the sweeper-fielder on the off side"
11.3,"Binny to Stoinis, no run","offcutter, length ball outside off, and he stands tall to punch. Firmly struck to mid-off"

10.2,"Gopal to Stoinis, no run","appeal again but umpire Erasmus turns it down. Full, just outside off, and Stoinis tries to sweep. Impact outside off, and there was a bit of glove involved too"
10.1,"Gopal to Hetmyer, OUT","appeal, and given! Shreyas Gopal's on fire. What a spell. Length ball on middle, and the googly turns away from Hetmyer. Goes onto the back foot to defend, but the ball goes past his outside edge, and takes a feather edge. Sharp catch from Buttler, bending low"
9.6,"Gowtham to Hetmyer, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, makes room and punches to sweeper cover"
9.5,"Gowtham to Hetmyer, no run",a touch slower on middle stump. Presses forward to defend and the ball turns less than expected. Rolls off the inside half of the bat to the left of midwicket
9.4,"Gowtham to Hetmyer, no run","back of a length, fired in quick on middle and off, punched back to the bowler"
9.3,"Gowtham to Hetmyer, no run","back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room and chops towards backward point. The pace on the ball gives him too little time to make as much room as he'd like"
9.2,"Gowtham to Hetmyer, no run","well bowled, a little bit of inward drift and less turn than expected as Hetmyer presses forward to defend. Past the inside edge and hits the pad, but it's probably missing leg stump"
9.1,"Gowtham to Patel, 1 run","flat, back of a length, angling into off stump, not much turn. Goes back to work it into the midwicket region, and the fielder is back on the boundary so the bowler has to give chase"
8.6,"Gopal to Hetmyer, no run","flat legbreak, closer to off stump. Punched to short extra-cover, and that's a wicket maiden for Shreyas"
8.5,"Gopal to Hetmyer, no run","again the ball grips and stops. The googly this time, straightening along the fourth-stump channel. Looks to punch it through the covers and ends up beaten, played too early"
8.4,"Gopal to Hetmyer, no run","legbreak, back of a length, stops on the batsman again and he blocks it back to the bowler"
8.3,"Gopal to AB, OUT","gottim, Kohli and AB in the space of two overs! Another wrong'un, back of a length, and again the ball stops on AB. This time it keeps low too, and in a hurried effort to jam his bat down and keep it out, he punches it firmly back to the bowler, at catchable height"
8.2,"Gopal to AB, no run","again, the googly stops on the batsman. Wanted to punch through cover, ends up playing it back to the bowler"
8.1,"Gopal to AB, no run","he's only bowling googlies today. Rocks back to punch into the covers, and ends up inside-edging into his back pad. Beaten by lack of pace off the surface, not the variation"
7.6,"Aaron to Patel, FOUR runs","short and wide, a no-no to Parthiv, who slaps it away gleefully to the left of third man"
7.5,"Aaron to AB, 1 run","shot! length ball angling in towards off stump, and AB shows the full face to punch it back between the stumps at the other end and the bowler, and long-on runs around to stop it at the boundary"
7.4,"Aaron to AB, 2 runs","back of a length, angling in towards middle stump, goes deep in his crease and works it to the left of deep square leg"
7.3,"Aaron to AB, FOUR runs","shortish, plenty of width, but the ball maybe doesn't bounce as much as de Villiers expected, and he ends up bottom-edging his cut to the fine leg boundary. Didn't miss off stump by much."
7.2,"Aaron to Patel, 1 run","once again a touch short, but more on middle and off. Parthiv looks to find the same gap with a similar shot, but ends up playing it squarer, and deep square leg can clean up with a sprint to his left"
7.1,"Aaron to Patel, FOUR runs","shortish, angling into leg stump, steps across and whips it off his hip and finds the gap to the right of fine leg"
6.6,"Gopal to AB, no run","another googly, flatter and outside off, presses forward and jabs to short third man"
6.5,"Gopal to AB, FOUR runs","another googly, shortish, and AB moves across his stumps in advance and sinks down on one knee to help it with the turn, over his shoulder and over the keeper's left shoulder"
6.4,"Gopal to AB, 2 runs","another wrong'un to greet him, goes deep in his crease to work it away through backward square leg"
6.3,"Gopal to Kohli, OUT","bowled him, we were talking about how he hasn't liked the googly, and he's done in by an absolute beaut of a googly. Tossed up slower than the previous one, and wider, and Kohli reaches out for the cover drive, leaving a big gap for the ball to spin back through. A strange innings from Kohli - looks like he was looking to play himself in and aiming to accelerate later, but if you get out for 23 off 25 the playing yourself in part doesn't look that good"
6.2,"Gopal to Kohli, no run","there's the googly. Big appeal for lbw, but I don't know why, seemed to be a thick inside edge and bat before pad. Looks to stay leg-side of the ball and jab it away through point, but ends up squeezing it between inside edge and pad flap"
6.1,"Gopal to Patel, 1 run","shortish, slanting away from off stump, no real turn back in. Slapped to deep point"
5.6,"Gowtham to Patel, 1 run","flat and full on leg stump, clipped to the left of long-on, not far enough to his left to pick up two"
5.5,"Gowtham to Kohli, 1 run","quickish length ball on off stump, shows the full face to punch to long-on"
5.4,"Gowtham to Patel, 1 run","shortish outside off, whipped away to deep midwicket with a lot of bottom hand"
5.3,"Gowtham to Kohli, 1 run","flat length ball outside off, stays back and punches to long-on"
5.2,"Gowtham to Patel, 1 run","back of a length again, a touch slower. This time he goes back and across to whip to long-on from just outside off stump"
5.1,"Gowtham to Patel, no run","back of a length, tight on off stump, no turn. Makes a bit of room and chops to backward point"
4.6,"Archer to Patel, 1 run","back of a length outside off, lets it come on and dabs gently into the gully region"
4.5,"Archer to Patel, FOUR runs","full now, on off stump, and Parthiv puts it away, clears his front leg and lofts it nice and clean over mid-off"
4.4,"Archer to Patel, no run","back of a length, angling into the top of off stump. He's cramped for room and he jabs it into the covers"
4.3,"Archer to Patel, FOUR runs","four more. Short again, and it's only angling in to about off stump, but Parthiv takes a big step across to use the pace and angle and help it away fine. Fine leg is inside the circle and has no chance of cutting it off"
4.2,"Archer to Patel, FOUR runs","shot. Knew third man was a touch square, and when Archer banged it in short, angling across to off stump, he simply leaned back and ramped it away nice and fine"
4.1,"Archer to Kohli, 1 leg bye","back of a length, angling into leg stump. Looks to clip it away but he's a little late on it. Rolls off the thigh pad to short fine leg"
3.6,"Kulkarni to Patel, FOUR runs","poor ball to bowl with fine leg inside the circle, shortish and down leg. Parthiv simply whips it away, in the air but a fair distance to that fielder's right. He was trying to bowl the offcutter and ended up dragging it down"
3.5,"Kulkarni to Kohli, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room and punches to deep cover point. I guess this was the fielder who dropped back when midwicket came into the circle"
3.4,"Kulkarni to Kohli, no run","back of a length on off stump, and now there's a fielder at midwicket to intercept Kohli's flick"
3.3,"Kulkarni to Kohli, no run","back of a length, a touch wider outside off. Presses forward and opens his bat face to dab to short third man"
3.2,"Kulkarni to Kohli, no run","back of a length, fourth-stump line. Stops on Kohli again. He wanted to punch it through the covers but ends up hitting it to mid-on off the inside half of the bat"
3.1,"Kulkarni to Kohli, FOUR runs","length ball angling into off stump, and Kohli takes a big step across to whip it away wide of mid-on, in the air but there's no one in the infield at midwicket"
2.6,"Gowtham to Kohli, 1 run","flatter length ball on off stump, punched down the ground to long-on"
2.5,"Gowtham to Kohli, no run",a bit more flight and wider outside off. Kohli looks to drive through cover and his outside edge is beaten by lack of turn
2.4,"Gowtham to Kohli, no run","fuller this time, on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
2.3,"Gowtham to Kohli, no run",flat length ball on middle and off. Looks to make room but can't manufacture enough to punch it past cover point
2.2,"Gowtham to Kohli, no run","a touch shorter outside off, looks to dab it past short third man but hits it too close to the fielder"
2.1,"Gowtham to Kohli, 2 runs","flat length ball turning in towards middle stump, worked away to the right of deep square leg"
1.6,"Kulkarni to Kohli, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, tucked away through square leg"
1.5,"Kulkarni to Kohli, no run","back of a length now, offcutter, nips in towards off stump. Kohli is on the front foot to it, jams his bat down hurriedly as it comes in and tucks him up. Bounces down into the ground behind him and rolls past off stump"
1.4,"Kulkarni to Kohli, no run",another outswinger fairly wide of off. Comes forward and opens his bat face to stab it to backward point
1.3,"Kulkarni to Kohli, FOUR runs","nicely bowled, a fifth-stump outswinger that Kohli jabs at with hard hands, coming forward to drive. Thick edge races away to the boundary to the left of third man, who's stationed quite square"
1.2,"Kulkarni to Kohli, no run","back of a length outside off, stops on Kohli slightly. He wanted to punch it through the covers, ends up playing a touch early and hitting it to mid-off"
1.2,"Kulkarni to Kohli, 1 wide","length ball, looking to maybe swing it away from middle and leg or thereabouts, ends up sliding it a fair way down the leg side"
1.1,"Kulkarni to Patel, 1 run","length ball on middle stump, tucked away through square leg off the back foot"
0.6,"Gowtham to Patel, 1 leg bye",spears this into the pads and Parthiv tucks it to the left of square leg
0.5,"Gowtham to Kohli, 1 run","back of a length on middle stump, punched to deep midwicket with a  pretty much straight bat"
0.4,"Gowtham to Kohli, FOUR runs","flat length ball on middle stump, not a particularly bad ball, and Kohli was looking to punch it through midwicket. Ends up sliding off the inside half of the bat for an inadvertent boundary between short fine leg and square leg"
0.3,"Gowtham to Patel, 1 run","length ball, sliding on with the angle towards the pads. Stays on the back foot to clip it to the right of short fine leg"
0.2,"Gowtham to Kohli, 1 run","flat, back of a length once more, spinning in towards off stump. Tucked away to deep midwicket"
0.1,"Gowtham to Kohli, 2 runs","back of a length, spinning in from outside off, goes back and across and works it away through midwicket"
19.2,"Sam Curran to Lamichhane, OUT","he's got it! Sam Curran has sprung out of nowhere and taken a hat-trick! Yorker at off stump, Lamichhane looks to drill through the off side and completely misses. He has lost his off stump. Delhi Capitals have done an unbelievable job of losing this game"
19.1,"Sam Curran to Rabada, OUT","leg stump outta there! Stunning, stunning comeback from Kings XI Punjab. And Sam Curran has delivered. 20 off 10 in a position he'd never batted before in a T20, and now he's here, taking his third wicket, almost dead-set nailing Capitals fortune with an inswinging yorker that's gone past KG's slog. On a hat-trick!"
18.6,"Shami to Avesh Khan, no run","bouncer at at middle stump line, backs away and swings. Beaten"
18.5,"Shami to Avesh Khan, FOUR runs","Ashwin with the Indian twirl of the wrists that suggests, ""how did that happen?"" Low full toss outside off. Avesh closes his eyes, looks leg side and swings his hands. The ball ends up trickling into the extra cover boundary"
18.4,"Shami to Avesh Khan, no run","short ball outside off, backs away and swings across the line, beaten"
18.3,"Shami to Vihari, OUT",splits the stumps! What a gorgeous sight. Shami delivers - that's Capitals' last regular batsman gone. Wow. Length ball at middle stump. Backs away and swings across the line and this sounds as good at it looks when the ball splits middle and leg
18.2,"Shami to Vihari, no run",under-edge bounces back down the pitch! Vihari backs away and is too slow on the pull at this short of a length ball. Shami takes some steps forward and collects
18.1,"Shami to Vihari, no run","length at off stump, hurries onto him and he defends into the pitch off the back foot"
17.6,"Sam Curran to Patel, OUT","KL Rahul holds on! Sam Curran wheeling away in the leg side. The camera cuts to the Capitals dugout and you will not spot a smile there. Length ball slanted across the corridor, looks to club it into the leg side, gets a leading edge that is at a comfortable catching height for the keeper"
17.6,"Sam Curran to Patel, 1 wide","called wide! Curran goes too short. Harshal was on the move, into the off side, setting up for a ramp. Was too late as it flew over the stumps"
17.5,"Sam Curran to Patel, no run","slower ball at a length just outside off, swishes at this and is beaten"
17.4,"Sam Curran to Ingram, OUT","what have you done Ingram! Delhi Capitals are trying very hard not to win right now! Length ball outside off, drills it straight to long-off! It was there for the drive, and he's been driving it wide of that fielder all along, and along the turf. Goes aerial this time and boy do we have a situation now"
17.3,"Sam Curran to Vihari, 1 run","slower ball in the corridor, defended to point's right"
17.2,"Sam Curran to Ingram, 1 run","full in the corridor, gets the front leg out and slices it but can't beat sweeper cover to the right"
17.1,"Sam Curran to Vihari, 1 run","length at leg stump, dropped into the leg side with soft hands"
16.6,"Shami to Ingram, no run",whistles away from under the bat in the corridor! Fire from Shami. A yorker that Ingram wants to carve behind point but can't get bat on that
16.5,"Shami to Morris, OUT","oh boy this game is still alive! R Ashwin has knocked the stumps down at the non-striker's end and sent Morris back first ball! Hare-brained run that. Length just outside, punches straight to Ashwin at mid-off and takes off in a frenzy. Clean pick-up, good technique and he hits the stumps on the bounce. You don't even need third umpire for this, he's well short"
16.4,"Shami to Pant, OUT","but Shami is no pushover! Full, straight, knocks middle stump back! A hint of away swing too there, from a leg stump line. He wanted to cart this over square leg and completely missed"
16.3,"Shami to Pant, SIX runs","see ya! Only takes a few hits to get into the match, this guy. Been a bit of a struggle in the last two games, but he's begun nailing them. Offcutter on a length at off stump, makes room and clubs it over long-on"
16.2,"Shami to Ingram, 1 run","length at off stump, stays deep in the crease and pulls off the inside half to deep midwicket"
16.1,"Shami to Ingram, no run","short and just outside off, cut straight to backward point"
15.6,"Ashwin to Ingram, 1 run","length on off stump, pushed into the covers with soft hands"
15.5,"Ashwin to Pant, 1 run","length at the stumps, punched down to long-on"
15.4,"Ashwin to Pant, no run","length at leg stump, slow. Loses the bottom hand again as he heaves at this. Straight to short fine"
15.3,"Ashwin to Pant, no run",beaten. Loses his shape. This is tossed right above his eyeline and dips quickly outside off. Can't connect as he looks to go over extra cover
15.2,"Ashwin to Pant, SIX runs","over deep midwicket! Length ball at leg stump, steps down and a little down leg side. Allows it to skid on and arches his body as he pulls out an old-fashioned slog"
15.1,"Ashwin to Ingram, 1 run","round arm, length and in at leg stump. Stays deep in the crease and flicks to deep midwicket"
14.6,"Mujeeb to Pant, no run","short of a length just outside off, looks to cut hard again and narrowly escapes dragging this straight onto off stump. It hurries him and bounces up into the keeper's body from the pitch"
14.5,"Mujeeb to Pant, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, looks to bludgeon this off the back foot, gets a thick outside edge past short third man"
14.4,"Mujeeb to Pant, no run","short and wide outside off, cut straight to point"
14.3,"Mujeeb to Ingram, 1 run",length and turning in at off. Allows it to come in and dabs it to backward point off the front foot
14.2,"Mujeeb to Ingram, SIX runs","pumps him over his head! Superb. Length ball just outside off. Looks like a regulation offbreak from the hand, but it skid straight on and that was in Ingram's favour. Got behind the line and lifted it with the bounce. First six of the innings"
14.1,"Mujeeb to Ingram, no run",length and skidding in at middle from outside off. Punched down the pitch on the front foot
13.6,"Ashwin to Ingram, 1 run","short of a length outside off, stays low as he pulls to deep midwicket"
13.5,"Ashwin to Ingram, FOUR runs","glorious. What a world class T20  batsman this guy is. Has a superb instinct for the poor ball and the field. Length outside off, just gets his weight into it and drives all along the turf, to long-off's right"
13.4,"Ashwin to Ingram, no run","length at off stump, pushed to Mandeep's right on the front foot. He nearly runs Pant out at the non-striker's end. Slides, picks up, throws on the bounce. And now Pant is injured, jamming his finger while diving"
13.3,"Ashwin to Pant, 1 run","googly outside off, stays on the back foot and clips it to deep midwicket"
13.2,"Ashwin to Pant, FOUR runs","one-handed back-hand through extra cover. Dropped short and wide and Pant wants to hit this so hard, he's lost grip on the bottom hand. Gets it wide of Mandeep, who leaps up and lands awkwardly on what looks like his right knee"
13.1,"Ashwin to Ingram, 1 run","length just outside off, gets on the back foot and punches to sweeper cover"
12.6,"Viljoen to Ingram, 1 run","length on off stump, shuffles and pokes to midwicket's left"
12.5,"Viljoen to Ingram, no run",given lbw! And he's reviewed it. No bat did that pitch in line? No it didn't! He'll survive as a result. Length ball. He walks across the stumps and looks to whip it behind square. Struck right in front of middle too. But a good call from him in the end
12.4,"Viljoen to Ingram, FOUR runs","shot! Two extremely good shots from Ingram, back to back. This time he gets four. Just no risk at all and he has six from two. This is length, pushed across him and he merely opens the face to lift it over point"
12.3,"Viljoen to Ingram, 2 runs",lovely fielding at sweeper cover! Ingram blazes a cut past point and Murugan with a sprint and a full length slide to get his right hand on this
12.2,"Viljoen to Ingram, no run","short of a length and pushed across off stump. Throws his hands at this to drive, gets it to extra cover off the toe-end"
12.1,"Viljoen to Pant, 1 run","short of a length across the corridor, pulled off the front foot, along the floor to deep midwicket"
11.6,"Ashwin to Ingram, 2 runs","googly at a length on middle stump, waits on it and drives to long-off's right. Pant spots an opportunity and calls for the second. Makes it back easily"
11.5,"Ashwin to Ingram, FOUR runs",scythes to the long leg boundary. Length ball pushed across him and he gets low and extends his arms to sweep uppishly
11.4,"Ashwin to Pant, 1 run","googly, short of a length outside off. Punched to sweeper cover off the back foot"
11.3,"Ashwin to Pant, no run","inside edge onto pad. Googly, dropped short and Pant wants to turn this behind square with a pull"
11.2,"Ashwin to Ingram, 1 run","misfield at extra cover. Length ball at off stump, tapped off the back foot to Mandeep who mistimes his pick up after getting low"
11.1,"Ashwin to Ingram, no run","length at off stump, looks to punch through the covers, gets a thick outside edge to point"
10.6,"Mujeeb to Ingram, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and steered to cover point"
10.5,"Mujeeb to Ingram, no run","length ball, just outside off, and guided to cover point off the back foot. Terrific fielding from Mandeep Singh - diving to his right - to stop the single"
10.4,"Mujeeb to Ingram, FOUR runs","length ball, quick outside off, and he uses the pace to cut behind square. Thumped to the backward-point boundary"
10.3,"Mujeeb to Ingram, no run","appeal for lbw but not given! A quick ball, length on middle, and skidding into Ingram. Misses the leg-side flick, and the ball hits his pads. But Kings XI don't review, probably because Ingram got an inside-edge to it"
10.2,"Mujeeb to Pant, 1 run","full on middle, and Pant looks to sweep. Bat-pads the shot to short fine leg"
10.1,"Mujeeb to Ingram, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and tapped to point for a quick run. Smart fielding from the fielder running in, but they can't stop the single"
9.6,"Ashwin to Ingram, 1 run","length ball, on off, and tapped down the ground to long on"
9.5,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, OUT","Ashwin wins the battle! Carrom ball on off, but the ball skids into Dhawan. He looks to cut, but the ball is too close to his body. Delivery clips his pads before Dhawan can get bat on it, and the umpire raises his finger. Dhawan doesn't review, but one reckons that he should've. The carrom-ball's angle seemed to take it down the leg side."
9.4,"Ashwin to Pant, 1 run","full on off, and Pant walks down the ground to cut the angle. Smacked to wide long on once again"
9.3,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, 1 run","full on leg, and he skips down the ground. Nudged away to wide long on"
9.2,"Ashwin to Pant, 1 run","full just outside off, but Pant goes down on one knee to sweep. Drags the shot to deep backward square"
9.1,"Ashwin to Pant, 2 runs","full on off, from around the wicket. Tapped to the big gap at midwicket, and they take off for two runs. Throw from the deep from Miller forces Pant to dive into his crease. But replays show Pant was comfortably in"
8.6,"Mujeeb to Pant, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off, and cut away to point. Well stopped, but the misfield allows the men to take a single. Timeout"
8.5,"Mujeeb to S Dhawan, 1 run","full just outside off, and Dhawan takes a big stride forward. Opens the bat's face, and works it to point. They walk across one"
8.4,"Mujeeb to Pant, 1 run","length ball, too wide outside off, and Pant stretches to cut. Played to short third man"
8.3,"Mujeeb to Pant, 2 runs","length ball, on middle, and worked off his pads to deep backward square"
8.2,"Mujeeb to Pant, FOUR runs","Pantastic! Full, just outside off, and Pant goes down on one knee to slog. Mistimed, but still enough behind it to beat the sliding fielder at deep midwicket"
8.1,"Mujeeb to S Dhawan, 1 run","full, just outside off from around the wicket. The ball turns into Dhawan, and he drives to Ashwin at cover. Misfield allows them to pinch a single"
7.6,"Viljoen to Pant, no run","back of a length on off, and angling away. Pant shapes up to cut, but finds Miller at point"
7.5,"Viljoen to Pant, 2 runs","slower ball, length on off, and he taps this with soft hands. But the ball hits the inside of his bat, then hits his pads, before rolling away to cover"
7.4,"Viljoen to Pant, 4 leg byes","length ball, outside leg, and Pant flicks fine past the keeper's left! Nobody's stopping that. Came off the bat, but the umpire says leg-byes"
7.3,"Viljoen to Pant, no run","length ball on leg, and Pant looks to muscle this off his hips straight away. Looks for the backward-point boundary, but the ball hits his chest-region"
7.2,"Viljoen to Iyer, OUT","played on! Viljoen is punching the air! Length ball, wide outside off, and Iyer tries to drive again. Too far away from him, and the attempted drive takes an inside edge. Ricochets into middle stump, and Kings XI are pumped. A bit of eye-to-eye action between Iyer and Viljoen after the wicket, but no shoulder barge. They came mighty close though! It's all happenin'"
7.1,"Viljoen to Iyer, FOUR runs","fullish, wide outside off, and Iyer hammers a front-foot drive through the covers! Picks the offcutter very early this time, Iyer"
6.6,"Mujeeb to S Dhawan, no run","length ball on middle, and skidding into Dhawan's pads. Rocks back, and punches to mid off"
6.5,"Mujeeb to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","length ball, on off, and angling away. Cut off the back foot, and this has been struck behind square! Nobody there, and the ball rolls along the grass to the boundary-line"
6.4,"Mujeeb to Iyer, 1 run",overcompensates by going full and wide outside off. Driven straight down the ground to long off
6.4,"Mujeeb to Iyer, 1 wide","length ball, on middle, and sliding down the leg side. Iyer misses the pull because the ball stays low, but Capitals collect the wide-run anyway"
6.3,"Mujeeb to S Dhawan, 1 run","length ball on leg, and he goes deep into his crease. Flicked to square leg for a jogging single"
6.2,"Mujeeb to Iyer, 1 run","full, just wide outside off, and driven to wide long off"
6.1,"Mujeeb to Iyer, no run","drifter first up. Lands on a length, just outside off, and slides inwards. Defended towards the off side"
5.6,"Shami to Iyer, 1 run","slower ball at a length on off stump, dropped into the off side with soft hands"
5.5,"Shami to Iyer, no run","legth on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
5.4,"Shami to Iyer, FOUR runs","whack! Good use of the crease from Iyer. Walks into the off side, get Shami to go short. The line would have been at his chest if he'd stayed where he was but he'd quickly jumped into the leg side and cut this over point. Lovely"
5.3,"Shami to S Dhawan, 1 run","length on off stump, shuffles and pushes to mid-off on the up"
5.2,"Shami to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","lifted over mid-off. Length ball just outside off, plants the front leg out and goes on the rise"

4.4,"Viljoen to Iyer, no run","length ball, just outside off, and he rides the bounce to block off the back foot"
4.3,"Viljoen to Iyer, no run","length ball on off, and tapped towards the on-side. Viljoen runs across to the leg side, to intercept"

4.1,"Viljoen to Iyer, FOUR runs","heavy ball, back of a length just outside off, and he opens the bat's face to run this down to the backward-point boundary. Excellent use of his wrists"
3.6,"Shami to Iyer, 1 run","offcutter, length ball outside off, and guided to short third man for a quick single"
3.5,"Shami to S Dhawan, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and tapped off the back foot to mid on. They take off for a quick single, and Sam Curran has a shy at the batsman's stumps. Wild throw, but David Miller's at third man backing up"
3.4,"Shami to S Dhawan, 2 runs","full on middle, and he whips this off his toes to the vacant region near cow corner. Mandeep from deep backward square needs to give the ball a mighty chase"
3.3,"Shami to Iyer, 1 run","back of a length on off, and tapped with the bat's open face to point. They scamper across for one"
3.2,"Shami to Iyer, no run","nearly chopped on! Length ball, offcutter on off stump, and Iyer tries to block. Ball comes inwards, takes his inside edge, hits the pitch, and bounces of the set of stumps"
3.1,"Shami to S Dhawan, 1 run","back of a length on off, but too close to Dhawan's body for the cut. Sliced to the off side"
2.6,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, 1 run","length ball on middle, and nudged off his pads to square leg"
2.5,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","full, wide outside off, and he creams a cover drive through the infield! Tiny gap between cover and cover point, but finds it nonetheless"
2.4,"Ashwin to Iyer, 1 run","full on middle, and nudged off his toes to square leg. They go for a quick single, and M Ashwin nearly gets a direct hit at the batsman's end"
2.4,"Ashwin to Iyer, 1 wide","full outside leg, and drifting further down. Iyer's back-leg is in the air, but it comes down before Rahul can think about a stumping"
2.3,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, 1 run","full, just outside off, and blocked with the bat's open face to cover point. They scamper across for one"
2.2,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, no run","length ball on off, and he goes deep into his crease. Tapped to cover, but straight to the fielder"
2.2,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, 1 wide","length ball on middle, but sliding down the leg side. Dhawan misses the flick, Rahul collects. Wide signalled"
2.1,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, no run","length ball on off, and skidding through. Blocked off the back foot towards cover"
1.6,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye","length ball angling into his body, and he works this off his hips to square leg"
1.5,"Sam Curran to Iyer, 1 run","length ball on off, and tapped off the back foot to short cover"
1.4,"Sam Curran to Iyer, FOUR runs","full outside off, and he drives with the bat's open face. Takes the bat's outside edge and rolls through to the backward-point boundary"
1.3,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye","did that hit the stumps? The bails haven't fallen off though. Length ball, slower delivery on leg, and Dhawan looks to nudge it behind square. But the ball hits his thigh-guard and rolls onto leg stump. Curran so unlucky!"
1.2,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, 2 runs","full outside off, and a bit of swing away. Driven firmly to cover, where there's a slight misfield"
1.1,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, no run","full on off, and he takes a big stride forward to drive. Bat's face turns in his hand, and it rolls down to Viljoen at mid-on"
0.6,"Ashwin to Iyer, no run","full just outside off, and carefully blocked back to Ashwin. A typically entertaining R Ashwin over"
0.5,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, 1 run","slider, length ball on middle, and worked off the back foot to midwicket"
0.4,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","length ball on middle, and the ball turns away after hitting the deck. Dhawan looks to work this towards the leg side, but leading edge takes the ball down to the third-man boundary. Ashwin asking a lot of questions!"
0.4,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, 1 wide","full on leg stump, but sliding down leg. Dhawan goes down on one knee to sweep, but misses"
0.3,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, no run","full on off, and Dhawan taps this to short cover. Tight from Ashwin"
0.2,"Ashwin to Iyer, 1 run","full on middle, and he pushes forward to drive to long on. They walk across for one"
0.1,"Ashwin to Shaw, OUT","through him! And umpire Chaudhuri raises his finger. Full outside off, and the ball holds it's line. Shaw presses forward to drive with the offspin, but the ball whizzes past his outside edge, and Rahul whips the bails off. Was that caught-behind or stumping? Caught-behind it is. Shaw finding it hard to add to his 99 from the other day"
19.6,"Rabada to Mandeep, SIX runs","over mid-off again! Good batting, not the best last ball. Length outside off. He gets on his back knee and handsomely lofts this over that fielder and flat, over the long-off boundary"
19.5,"Rabada to Mandeep, FOUR runs",just clears mid-off. Slower short ball outside off. He hangs back this time and picks his spot. That fielder is in so he flat-bats it over him. Just.
19.4,"Rabada to Shami, OUT","run-out at the non-striker's end. Mean bouncer from Rabada, gets Shami on the body. He's too shocked to react as Mandeep rightly hares down the pitch to take strike. Rabada walks back to the stumps, takes a single bail off, and puts it back into place. Checks if Shami's alright after the impact - gets a thumbs up"
19.3,"Rabada to Mandeep, 1 run","yorker at leg stump, jams it down to long-on who keeps them to a single"
19.2,"Rabada to Mandeep, 2 runs","slower short ball at middle stump, waits on it and pulls to deep midwicket's right"
19.1,"Rabada to Ashwin, OUT","taken by short third man who has Rishabh Pant very close and also going for it! Complete breakdown in communication and they have a brief bicker about it. Rabada smiles - as long as it's in. Short of a length ball at off stump, wants to swish off the back foot and gets a leading edge. It pops out of Avesh's hands as he makes contact with Pant, but he hangs on"
18.6,"Morris to Ashwin, 1 run","full slower ball at off stump, watches closely and stabs this out to point"
18.5,"Morris to Ashwin, OUT","smashes off stump. A low full toss that Ashwin wants to hit inside-out over cover. Not an easy shot when you're set, nearly no chance of connection when you're just in. Misses it completely"
18.4,"Morris to Mandeep, 1 run",inside edge as Morris goes wide of the crease late and changes the angle on him. It's length and it's at middle. He looks to slog but it's into his pad before rolling out to short third
18.3,"Morris to Ashwin, 1 run","deceived by the slower ball, but he manages to get bat on this attempted scoop. A loopy, dipping yorker from Morris. He just manages to get it down to fine leg off the toe-end"
18.2,"Morris to Mandeep, 1 run","full on middle stump, gets low and drives uppishly, finds long-on"
18.1,"Morris to Ashwin, 1 run","attempted yorker at middle stump, backs away and sliced on the full to deep extra"
17.6,"Rabada to Ashwin, 1 run",short of a length ball thumps Ashwin's bat as he gets on the back foot. A single stolen pitch side on the off side
17.5,"Rabada to Mandeep, 1 run",short of a length slower ball at middle stump. Gets low and drags this pull out to deep square
17.4,"Rabada to Mandeep, no run","bouncer outside off, swishes from under it, tries to ramp it to the third man boundary. Beaten"
17.3,"Rabada to Viljoen, OUT",taken at extra cover! Short of a length in the corridor and too quick for Viljeon. He wants to whip this into the leg side but the ball's hit bat before he can even close the face on it. Sliced harmlessly in Morris' direction and he takes it with a reverse-cup
17.2,"Rabada to Mandeep, 1 run","length at off stump, looks to pull, gets it to long-on off the inside half"
17.1,"Rabada to Mandeep, FOUR runs","misfield at deep square leg. That's sloppy. Length ball swiped across the line. Bandaru Ayyappa, substitute fielder, pedals to his left and gets his body behind this. But he gets his hands in a mess and can't hold on on the bounce. Ends up parrying it to his left and into the boundary"
16.6,"Morris to Viljoen, no run","slower ball just outside off, gets to the pitch and flicks it straight back onto the stumps"
16.5,"Morris to Mandeep, 1 run","overpitched on leg stump, flicked out to deep midwicket"

16.3,"Morris to Mandeep, 1 wide","length ball down leg side, can't get bat on it"
16.2,"Morris to Miller, OUT","they've got him! You just sense this will be many runs off Kings XI's final total. Lovely bowling from Morris. An offcutter pushed across the corridor, Miller goes across the line, trying to go aerial in the midwicket region. Top-edge doesn't go further than pitchside, Pant calls and holds on"
16.1,"Morris to Mandeep, 1 run","slower ball at a length outside off, crisp square drive on the up, straight to backward point"
15.6,"Patel to Mandeep, 1 run","length outside off, driven on the up to extra cover"
15.5,"Patel to Miller, 1 run","length outside off, driven on the up to sweeper"
15.4,"Patel to Miller, FOUR runs",past long-off. Miller's patience serving him well. Gets another full toss outside off. This one is even delivered with rolled fingers - lobs up at him and he spanks it on the full
15.3,"Patel to Mandeep, 1 run",leading edge down to third man. Full and in at middle stump and once again he's too keen - closes the face early
15.2,"Patel to Mandeep, no run","length outside off, wants to flick, closes the face too early. This trickles back down the pitch"
15.1,"Patel to Mandeep, no run","yorker at a leg stump, looks to clip this but can't get it off the pitch"
14.6,"Avesh Khan to Miller, FOUR runs","it does cost him. Low full toss just outside off, stays leg side of it and merely opens his wrists to get this over extra cover and beat long-off to his right"
14.6,"Avesh Khan to Miller, 1 wide","down leg side. Length ball, far away from the swing of the bat. Will this extra ball cost Avesh? Decent over so far "
14.5,"Avesh Khan to Mandeep, 1 run","slower ball at a length on middle stump, flicks uppishly into the midwicket region"
14.4,"Avesh Khan to Miller, 1 run","length on middle stump, flicked to long-on"
14.3,"Avesh Khan to Miller, no run",beaten. Length ball slanted across the corridor. Looks to line up and slug this over midwicket but it skids low
14.2,"Avesh Khan to Mandeep, 1 run","length at middle stump, punched to long-on"
14.1,"Avesh Khan to Mandeep, no run","length outside off, defended into the off side"
13.6,"Lamichhane to Mandeep, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, skidding straight on. Dropped in front of point with soft hands"
13.5,"Lamichhane to Khan, OUT",got him! A thin edge. Sarfraz commits on the front foot to a delivery that falls short of a good length. It holds and spins away marginally as he looks to drive on the up and he can't manage it. Superb bowling to end an extremely important innings in a thin middle order
13.4,"Lamichhane to Miller, 1 run","length on middle stump, flicked with the turn to long-on"
13.3,"Lamichhane to Khan, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, opens the face and runs it to short third man"

12.6,"Patel to Miller, 1 run","length outside off, pushed to extra cover on the up"
12.5,"Patel to Miller, no run","dropped. Length ball on middle stump, stays tall and punches firmly back at the bowler who can't react quickly enough in his follow through"
12.4,"Patel to Miller, FOUR runs","down to third man! Length outside off, across him, and he slashes just inside the line and opens the face late to get it down"
12.3,"Patel to Miller, FOUR runs","short ball at middle stump, gets deep in the crease, gets his hands over this and hits it on the head with a hook. Gets it to the deep backward square bounday"
12.2,"Patel to Miller, 2 runs","length on middle stump, flicked to long-on's left"
12.1,"Patel to Khan, 1 run","uff, sweet. But only a run. Length outside off and he gets the hands so nicely through the line with this drive"
11.6,"Lamichhane to Miller, SIX runs","shot! Nice flowing slog through the line from Miller. Big ground, but he's cleared it with some ease. Length ball at middle and he jumps down and goes on the rise, over the wide long-on boundary"
11.5,"Lamichhane to Khan, 1 run","length and skidding on at leg stump. Shapes to pull, gets an inside edge to short fine's right"
11.4,"Lamichhane to Miller, 1 run","googly, full on off stump, driven to long-off"
11.3,"Lamichhane to Khan, 1 run","short of a length at middle stump, gets back and pulls to deep midwicket"
11.2,"Lamichhane to Khan, no run","length, skidding in at leg stump. Steps out and is forced to offer the pad as he's beaten in the air"
11.1,"Lamichhane to Miller, 1 bye","beats the batsman with a googly, but he gets off strike as Pant can't gather cleanly. Deflected towards short fine. This spun away from a lengt"
10.6,"Vihari to Khan, FOUR runs","full and wide outside off, waits on it and chops it deftly past backward point. This guy knows how to pick a gap!"
10.5,"Vihari to Miller, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
10.4,"Vihari to Khan, 1 run","length and pushed across off stump, leans in and drives with the angle to long-off's left"
10.3,"Vihari to Miller, 1 run",length ball pushed wide outside off. Steps out and is beaten in flight but he reaches out and gets it past Vihari off the toe-end

10.1,"Vihari to Miller, 1 run","full on off stump, driven with the turn down to long-off"
9.6,"Patel to Miller, 1 run","back of a length on leg stump, and he mistimes a pull. Ball rolls away to short fine leg. Kings XI 86 for 3 at the halfway stage"
9.6,"Patel to Miller, 1 wide","slower ball from over the wicket, but full outside leg stump. Through to the keeper"
9.5,"Patel to Miller, SIX runs","toe-ended, but over extra cover! Full outside off, but Miller's done hanging about. Gets to the pitch of the ball, and clatters this offcutter over the boundary-line. Crowd erupts!"
9.4,"Patel to Khan, 1 run","length ball, wide outside off, and he glances a late-cut down to third man. Enough time to walk across for one"
9.3,"Patel to Miller, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and tapped away to cover. Quick run"
9.2,"Patel to Miller, no run","length ball, from around the wicket. Just outside off stump, and it's too close to Miller's body for the cut. Through to Pant this time"
9.1,"Patel to Khan, 1 run","slower ball, full outside off, and he tries to loft this over mid-off. Slices the shot over point instead"
8.6,"Avesh Khan to Khan, 1 run","length ball on middle, and worked off his hips to square leg. Timeout"
8.5,"Avesh Khan to Khan, FOUR runs","the audacity! Length ball on off, but Sarfaraz ducks under the ball, keeps his bat ready for the ramp, and Dilscoops over the keeper."
8.4,"Avesh Khan to Khan, FOUR runs","length ball, wide outside off, but angling into off stump. But Sarfaraz displays no footwork, simply opens the bat's face, and glances a boundary past the fielder at backward-point! Classy"
8.3,"Avesh Khan to Khan, no run","back of a length on off, and he stays on the back foot to block. Ball rolls back to Avesh"
8.2,"Avesh Khan to Miller, 1 run","back of a length on leg, and he flicks this to deep midwicket"
8.1,"Avesh Khan to Miller, no run","beauty! Length ball on middle, and angling across Miller. He prods forward to block, but the ball whizzes past his outside edge"
7.6,"Patel to Miller, 1 run",slower ball to end the over and Miller's too early into his attempted drive. Hits the bat's inside half and flies down to long on
7.5,"Patel to Miller, no run","slower ball, back of a length outside off, and he slices a punched shot to Shaw. Stops a couple of runs for certain"
7.4,"Patel to Miller, no run","length ball, just wide outside off, and blocked away to cover once again"
7.4,"Patel to Miller, 5 wide","back of a length on middle, but going down the leg side. Miller swivels to pull, but he can't get any connection. No worries for Kings XI, though, since Pant can't hold on to it either"
7.3,"Patel to Miller, no run","slower ball, from around the wicket. Back of a length outside off, and tapped away to cover off the back foot"
7.2,"Patel to Khan, 1 run","slower ball, full on middle, and nudged away to deep midwicket"
7.1,"Patel to Khan, OUT","length ball, wide outside off, and he drills a drive to cover. Straight to Dhawan, and he quickly throws down the stumps at the bowler's end. Mayank's out of his crease, and that's a direct hit! Kings XI lose their third, this against the run of play"
6.6,"Lamichhane to Khan, 1 run","extra flight, full outside off, and he caresses a drive to Ingram at wide long off"
6.5,"Lamichhane to Agarwal, 1 run","full on off, and he goes onto the back foot. Flicks to the vacant midwicket region, and they want the second run. But Morris runs in from long-on to stop the second"
6.4,"Lamichhane to Khan, 1 run","length ball on middle, and worked off his pads down the ground to long on"
6.3,"Lamichhane to Agarwal, 1 run","quicker one, wide outside off, and the cut is mistimed to deep point. They walk across for one"
6.2,"Lamichhane to Agarwal, no run","length ball, wide outside off again, and Mayank goes for the cut-shot one more time. Under-edged towards the keeper on this occasion. Two dots"
6.1,"Lamichhane to Agarwal, no run","length ball, just outside off, and Mayank stays on the back foot. Looks to cut square, but can't clear the infield"
5.6,"Morris to Agarwal, 1 run","back of a length on off, and the natural angle takes it into the batsman. Worked off his chest to deep midwicket. Kings XI 54 for 2 after the Powerplay"
5.5,"Morris to Khan, 1 run","full just outside off, and tapped towards mid-off. Nice, early call fore a single"
5.4,"Morris to Khan, no run","ouch! Sarfaraz tries to duck under a ball, but the ball doesn't rise enough. Hits him near the chest as he tries to get out of the ball's way. No love lost though, Morris just picks the ball up nonchalantly"
5.3,"Morris to Khan, FOUR runs","low full toss on middle, and he flicks this off his toes to the leg side. Nobody at deep midwicket, and the ball races away for four more. Fifty for Kings XI"
5.2,"Morris to Khan, FOUR runs","beautiful! Full, too wide outside off, and he check-drives a shot through the covers! Four men inside the circle on the off side, but Sarfaraz pierces the tiny gap"
5.1,"Morris to Khan, no run","full, and wide outside off, and he takes a big step forward to drive. Mistimed to cover point"
4.6,"Rabada to Agarwal, 2 runs","back of a length on off, and he rides the bounce to work the ball towards deep midwicket. Fielder from the deep races in as they go for the second, but his throw from the deep gets a direct hit! This could be dangerous, but the umpires reckon Agarwal is fine. Agarwal, though, doesn't feel he's OK. He's asked for the physio while holding onto his hamstring"
4.5,"Rabada to Agarwal, no run","length ball on off, but Mayank makes room to lift this over extra cover. Splices the shot to the leg side instead"
4.4,"Rabada to Khan, 1 run","back of a length, just outside off, and he steers this off the back foot to third man"
4.3,"Rabada to Khan, no run","back of a length on off, and he rides the bounce to block off the back foot. Ball rolls back to KG Rabada"
4.2,"Rabada to Khan, no run","full on off, and tapped back past the non-striker to long on. Well fielded by Morris charging in"
4.1,"Rabada to Khan, FOUR runs","full on leg, and flicked with soft hands. Doesn't give it the whip, but the ball races away to the backward-square boundary anyway. In control"
3.6,"Lamichhane to Khan, 1 run","flighted full on middle, and a smart wristy flick to deep midwicket from Sarfaraz"
3.5,"Lamichhane to Sam Curran, OUT","lbw appeal, and given! What a comeback ball from Lamichhane. Quick on middle, skidding straight through, and the ball hits him in front of middle stump even before Curran can bring his bat down. Quick decision from umpire Gaffaney too. An interesting experiment comes to an end"
3.4,"Lamichhane to Sam Curran, SIX runs","up and over! Tossed up on middle, and Curran skips down the ground. Picks the googly well, and muscles a lofted shot into the sightscreen"
3.3,"Lamichhane to Sam Curran, 2 runs","tossed up on middle, and the legbreak is nudged away to wide long on. Fielder at the deep attacks the ball slightly late, which allows the batsmen to pinch the double"
3.2,"Lamichhane to Sam Curran, no run","googly to start off. Full on off, and spinning further away. Tapped off the back foot to mid off"
3.1,"Lamichhane to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball on middle, and skidding into leg stump. Played off the back foot to long on for a single"
2.6,"Avesh Khan to Sam Curran, no run","length ball, pitching outside off but angling in. Nudged with the bat's open face to point"
2.5,"Avesh Khan to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","not full enough, but wide enough for Curran to make full use. Stays in his crease, and hammers a back-foot punch past mid off's right!"
2.4,"Avesh Khan to Sam Curran, no run","back of a length, just outside off, and blocked off the back foot to point"
2.3,"Avesh Khan to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","full again, but wider outside off. Curran simply prods forward and lifts an exquisite cover drive over the infield"

2.1,"Avesh Khan to Sam Curran, no run","back of a length on middle, and punched off the back foot to mid-off. Curran's first ball"
1.6,"Morris to Agarwal, no run","full, just outside off, and he takes a big step forward to drive. Mistimed to cover"
1.5,"Morris to Rahul, OUT","full on off but swinging in very late. Rahul tries to drive down the ground, but misses, and Morris appeals for lbw. Umpire says out but Rahul reviews. This looked like it was going down leg, but replays suggest that it's closer than that. There's no bat involved, so we wait for ball-tracking. Ball's clipping leg stump, so Rahul has to go! Big wicket, but Kings XI retain their review"
1.4,"Morris to Rahul, SIX runs","pulled with disdain! Shorter from Morris, but he doesn't possess the pace to trouble a top-order batsman. Swivels, and pulls with the angle over fine leg"
1.3,"Morris to Rahul, no run","sticks with the back-of-a-length delivery. Angling into his body, and tapped towards midwicket"
1.2,"Morris to Rahul, FOUR runs","length ball on middle, and angling down leg. Rahul allows the ball to come to him, and flicks off his hips to the backward-square boundary"
1.1,"Morris to Rahul, no run","back of a length on off, cramping Rahul for space. He tiptoes to nudge a shot towards midwicket"
0.6,"Rabada to Rahul, 1 run","full on leg, and the ball was going down the leg side, but Rahul wants to get bat on ball. Flicked from beyond the stumps, and it lands safely near fine leg. Rahul's disappointed. Misses out on a boundary"
0.5,"Rabada to Rahul, no run","full on off, and angling into middle stump. Takes a tiny step forward, and defends back to Rabada"
0.4,"Rabada to Rahul, no run","fuller, on off, and he mistimes a front-foot defense towards the off side"
0.3,"Rabada to Rahul, FOUR runs","length ball on off, and angling into Rahul's pads. Goes deep into his crease, and tucks this square past midwicket. Two fielders giving it a chase, but it's a futile one. Balanced shot"
0.2,"Rabada to Rahul, no run","length ball, outside off stump, but swaying away from him this time. Left alone once more. Nice carry through to Pant"
0.1,"Rabada to Rahul, no run","left alone! Length ball, outside off, and swinging inwards slightly. Rahul takes a big stride forward and then shoulders his arms"
19.6,"Bravo to Archer, 1 run","length ball, on off, and flat-batted to cover. They scamper across for a single and Chennai Super Kings win by eight runs!"
19.5,"Bravo to Gopal, OUT","in the air and taken at third man! Tahir takes the catch, and he gives the crowd a flying kiss. The Chepauk erupts. Length ball, on off, and Gopal's attempted slog takes an outside edge"
19.4,"Bravo to Archer, 1 run","full and very wide outside off, and Jofra mistimes a drive to cover. Walks across for a single. His bat is broken too"
19.3,"Bravo to Gopal, 1 leg bye","back of a length on middle, and the ball hits Gopal's shoulders. Delivery rolls down to third man"
19.2,"Bravo to Gopal, no run","back of a length, on off, and Gopal backs away to cut this square. Ball goes over Gopal's bat. Nifty from Bravo"
19.1,"Bravo to Stokes, OUT","soft dismissal! Chinna Thala to the rescue. Low full toss on off, and Stokes tries to lift it over cover, but he's sliced this to Raina at cover"
18.6,"Thakur to Stokes, 1 run","back of a length, outside off, and he drags a pull to deep midwicket. Royals need 12 off the final over"
18.5,"Thakur to Stokes, 2 runs","low full toss on off, and he drills a drive to extra cover. Shorey cleans up"
18.4,"Thakur to Stokes, SIX runs","one-handed shot for six! Holy moly. Length ball angling into Stokes from around the wicket, but he uses his wrists and swivels to pull behind square. One hand comes off his bat, but enough power behind that to go for a maximum. Unbelievable"
18.3,"Thakur to Archer, 1 run","back of a length on middle, but slower from Shardul. Jofra pulls behind square to deep fine leg"
18.2,"Thakur to Archer, 2 runs","sliced over point and falls safe. Full outside off, and looked to drive over cover, but edged the ball behind square instead"
18.1,"Thakur to Stokes, 1 leg bye","full on off, and angling into Stokes. He skips down the wicket to try and muscle this over to the leg side, but inside-edges the shot into his pads. They scamper across for one"
17.6,"Bravo to Archer, no run","yorker just outside leg stump, but the ball hits his boot and rolls away to Dhoni. Could've been a wide if Jofra got out of the delivery's way. Royals need 25 off 12 now"
17.5,"Bravo to Archer, SIX runs","that's outta here! Full, not fast enough on middle, and he clears his front leg to hammer a six over Bravo's head. This guy can bat"
17.4,"Bravo to Archer, 2 runs","low full toss on middle, and he flicks to deep midwicket. Calls early for the second, and both these men are pretty quick"
17.3,"Bravo to Stokes, 1 run","slower ball, full on off, and he mistimes a drive to cover. Raina dives to his left to intercept, and stops Stokes from coming back on strike"
17.2,"Bravo to Stokes, FOUR runs","paddled! Back of a length on middle, but Stokes shuffles across the stumps, exposes all three stumps, and then gets enough bat to find the gap between keeper and short fine leg"
17.1,"Bravo to Stokes, SIX runs","slapped! Slower ball, really full outside off, and he clears his front leg, before flat-batting a six over wide long off. Royals need 38 off 17"
16.6,"Thakur to Archer, SIX runs","muscled over long on! Quick ball, full on leg, but he clears his front leg to lift a shot over the boundary. Royals need 44 off 18"
16.5,"Thakur to Archer, no run","length ball, skidder outside off, and going straight into Dhoni's gloves. Jofra can't get bat on ball"
16.4,"Thakur to Stokes, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and he drives away from his body to extra cover"
16.3,"Thakur to Archer, 1 run","back of a length on middle, and he taps this away to the leg side for a quick single. Good dedication from Shardul, chasing the ball"
16.2,"Thakur to Archer, FOUR runs","length ball, wide outside off, and cut square to the point boundary! Fielder from third man can't intercept"
16.1,"Thakur to Gowtham, OUT","sliced to cover! Full just outside off, and Gowtham looks to smoke a drive over cover. Bat's face turns in his hand, and the spliced shot goes to Raina at the 30-yard circle"
15.6,"Tahir to Gowtham, 1 run","length ball on off, and driven down to long off. Tahir nearly gets his hands to this. An excellent spell comes to an end"

15.4,"Tahir to Gowtham, 1 run","faster ball, flat on middle, and the attempted nudge to the leg side takes a leading edge to short third man!"
15.3,"Tahir to Gowtham, no run","full outside leg, but turning into his pads. Gowtham looks to nudge it square, but the ball hits his pad"
15.2,"Tahir to Gowtham, no run","crazy spin! Full, wide outside off, and Gowtham goes for a slogged sweep. But the ball spins further away from Gowtham, and Dhoni collects sharply"
15.1,"Tahir to Gowtham, SIX runs","that's a biggie! Full on off, and Gowtham - the offspinner - picks the googly well. Swings across the line, and has enough behind that shot to clear wide long on"
14.6,"Jadeja to Stokes, 2 runs","length ball on middle, and tucked away to wide long on. Enough time for Stokes to come back for the second"
14.5,"Jadeja to Gowtham, 1 run","length ball on off, and he whips this off his hips to deep midwicket. Gives Stokes the strike for the final ball"

2.6,"Chahar to Samson, OUT","Has he taken that at cover? Not too dissimilar to how Rahane perished. Third-umpire has been called.

0.2,"Chahar to Rahane, OUT","has he taken that? Length outside off, shaping away again, Rahane follows the swing with just his bat without getting to the pitch, it held in the pitch a little, got him high on the bat, and went aerially towards backward point, who had to dive forward, full length and did so brilliantly! Third-umpire confirms that it carried and what a start for CSK after the spectacular Dhoni finish with the bat"
0.1,"Chahar to Rahane, no run","full on off, nice shape away, Rahane leans forward and defends"
19.6,"Unadkat to Dhoni, SIX runs","Vinod Rajpal, you called it mate! Length ball, on middle, and Dhoni stays on the back foot before muscling a six over long on. That's Dhoni's highest IPL score at the Chepaul, and CSK finish on 175 for 5"

18.1,"Archer to Dhoni, FOUR runs","full toss, on off stump, and Dhoni opens his bat's face to drive. Placed past point, and that goes away for four! Crowd on its feet as Dhoni raises his bat. Fifty"
17.6,"Kulkarni to Bravo, SIX runs","boom, boom from Bravo! Overpitched, and Kulkarni pays the price. Bravo goes low, and then plays an inside-out drive that clears the extra-cover boundary. CSK cream 24 off that over"
17.5,"Kulkarni to Bravo, FOUR runs","finds the gap Super innovative. Back of a length outside off, but Bravo waits for the ball to come to him, before slicing an uppish drive over point. Except, it takes the bat's edge, and goes between backward point and short third man"
17.4,"Kulkarni to Dhoni, 1 run","slower ball, too short, and pulled away to deep midwicket. Stokes comes charging in to stop the second run"
17.3,"Kulkarni to Dhoni, SIX runs","just over extra cover! Low full toss outside off, but Dhoni goes really low before lifting a shot over the off side. Crowd goes ballistic"

17.3,"Kulkarni to Dhoni, 1 wide","wiiiild! Full toss, very wide outside off stump, and the ball takes an awkward bounce just in front of Buttler. The keeper does well, stopping the ball from going for extras"
17.2,"Kulkarni to Dhoni, 2 runs","it's a nothing ball, slow from DK, and Dhoni hammers a pull behind square. Terrific effort from Gowtham in the deep, diving across the grass to stop the ball"

16.3,"Archer to Dhoni, no run","yorker, just outside off, and dug away off the bat's toe end"
16.2,"Archer to Dhoni, FOUR runs","another slower one, but too wide. Dhoni reaches out, cuts behind square, and pierces the gap between point and short third man. Genius"

15.6,"Unadkat to Bravo, 1 run","slower ball, wide outside off, and cut away off the back foot. Wristy work, and that beats the fielder at point as well"
15.6,"Unadkat to Bravo, 1 wide","slower ball, full on middle, and Bravo looks to nudge this fine down the leg side. But he can't get the contact"
15.5,"Unadkat to Dhoni, 1 run","full on off, and driven away to cover. Dhoni wants the single, and Gowtham has a shy at the stumps . but misses"
15.4,"Unadkat to Dhoni, 2 runs","slower, length ball on off, and he muscles a cut to point. Dhoni wants Bravo to take the second, and they comfortably sprint back for it"
15.3,"Unadkat to Bravo, 1 run","length ball, just outside off, and he cuts this fine to third man. Just a single, though"
15.2,"Unadkat to Bravo, 2 runs","slower ball on off, and Bravo's too early into his flick. Mistimed to the vacant midwicket region, and it's that mistime which allows the batsmen to pinch the second run"
15.1,"Unadkat to Dhoni, 1 run","back of a length outside off, and nudged away to point. Team hundred"
14.6,"Stokes to Bravo, FOUR runs","full and wide outside off, and Bravo goes up and over! Bat's face opened, and driven over point for a boundary"

14.1,"Stokes to Dhoni, 1 run","dropped at cover! Full just outside off, and Dhoni came down the ground to thump a cover drive. Samson Gowtham dives to his left to try and get his hands to it, manages to get fingertips. Was a really difficult chance though. MSD had hit that with some real power"

13.5,"Unadkat to Bravo, no run","length ball, on off, and he goes onto the back foot to defend"
13.4,"Unadkat to Raina, OUT","got 'im! Rolls this slower ball, full on middle stump, and Raina backs away to lift it over cover. Through his shot too early, and the ball crashes into middle stump. Huge roar from Unadkat"
13.3,"Unadkat to Raina, no run","full on middle, but Raina shuffles across the stumps to flick. Played to short fine leg, and Raina wants the single. Dhoni says no, so Raina needs to come back. Dhawal Kulkarni throws the ball at the batsman's stumps, with Raina not even attempting to come back, but he misses the direct hit. Raina survives! So close"
13.2,"Unadkat to Dhoni, 1 run","back of a length, wide outside off, and steered to short third man"
13.1,"Unadkat to Dhoni, FOUR runs","hammered! Back of a length, outside off, and he skips down the wicket. Flat-bats it over the umpire's head, and long on has no chance"
12.6,"Stokes to Dhoni, 1 run","back of a length, but only 125kph. Enough time for Dhoni to pull behind square for a single"
12.5,"Stokes to Dhoni, 2 runs","full just outside off, and Dhoni pushes forward with the bat's open face to drive. Played square past the fielder at point, but there's protection in the deep"

2.3,"Kulkarni to Watson, FOUR runs","short on middle, Watson is on the front foot but manages to pull it away from there, in front of square, helped by the slowness of the pitch and that's a boundary"
2.2,"Kulkarni to Watson, no run","length on middle, defends back to the bowler"
2.1,"Kulkarni to Watson, no run","big appeal and given! Watson is bemused. It was angled in on a length, seemed to have brushed his thigh pad on the way to the keeper down the leg side and he missed that by a long way. Overturned on review"
1.6,"Archer to Rayudu, OUT","edged and gone! Length and into the body, Rayudu looked a little rattled by the blow to the forearm couple of balls before, makes room, Archer follows him and all the batsman can manage in the end is steer it into the gloves of the keeper"
1.5,"Archer to Rayudu, no run","length on off, wild swing from Rayudu, under pressure due to the dot balls, drags it along the ground to mid-on"
1.4,"Archer to Rayudu, no run","length into the body, extra bounce there for Archer, reared onto Rayudu, who fended it awkwardly. Looks in some sort of pain there Rayudu, the physio is out to attend to him. Struck on the forearm, it appears"

0.1,"Kulkarni to Rayudu, no run","full on off, indication that it remains a pretty slow surface, didn't quite come on, shuffles across and defends with ease"

19.4,"Sandeep to Siraj, 1 run","short ball, and he pulls this towards deep midwicket. Nabi runs in, and gets to it, but cannot hold on as he falls. Looks a little bothered by that, but hopefully his fingers are fine"

18.4,"Shankar to Siraj, (no ball) OUT","one of the two players is run out! It was played towards covers, and the fielder fired a quick return back to the bowler. He whips the bails off, and CdG's bat is in the air! He also got rid of Siraj at the other end, but sadly only one of those will count. Sums up RCB's evening, though. Nothing has gone right from the first ball itself this afternoon"
18.4,"Shankar to Siraj, 1 wide","fuller ball, but down the leg side. Will have to have a go again at this"
18.3,"Shankar to Grandhomme, 1 run","full toss, and he goes inside out. Bhuvneshwar Kumar lets this one slip through his hands, fielding at cover"

16.4,"Shankar to Yadav, 1 wide","will have to rebowl this. Down the leg side, and called wide"
16.3,"Shankar to Yadav, no run","short, and he looks to swing this around. Called wide, but SRH have reviewed this for a caught-behind. Yadav was looking to move across and get this down towards fine leg, and Bairstow collected. From the first look, it looks like it might have taken a bit of the thigh pad. Will have to take this back and call it a dot ball"

Slower ball at a length on leg stump, flicked towards midwicket. Mo wants the run, he's sent back. The fielder is off balance as he throws and therefore it comes in on the bounce.

12.2,"Ray Barman to Warner, 1 run","sharp turn back into him from a length, some bounce too, and he goes back and cuts this towards backward point. Well bowled!"
12.1,"Ray Barman to Warner, 2 runs","fuller ball, and he drives this towards extra cover, and canters through for two. That's FIFTY for Warner!"
11.6,"Yadav to Bairstow, FOUR runs","full, outside off, and he creams this through covers. Stand and deliver!"
11.5,"Yadav to Bairstow, no run","yorker! Perfectly done straight and full. and he squeezes this off the inside towards the keeper. Parthiv Patel has a shy at the stumps but Bairstow is home. Wants to steal a single off the deflection, but the fielder at point converges on this quickly"
11.4,"Yadav to Bairstow, no run","short, and goes in towards him. Bairstow backs away, and leaves it. He hopes for this to be called wide, but it is just one short ball for the over"
11.3,"Yadav to Bairstow, 2 runs","short, and he moves away and swings this over the man at short midwicket. Wide long on gets across but cannot stop them from picking up two"
11.2,"Yadav to Bairstow, SIX runs","fuller, and he goes towards wide long on, and clears him comfortably! Sensational stuff from these two players!"
11.1,"Yadav to Bairstow, FOUR runs","Yadav returns with a short ball, it's also slower through the air, and Bairstow hangs back and swings him around to long leg for four!"
10.6,"Ali to Warner, no run","length ball, grips on the surface, and takes the leading edge as he looks to play this to the onside. No run for this"
10.5,"Ali to Warner, 2 runs","length ball, and he pats it towards midwicket and runs hard to pick up two. He goes to 49!"
10.4,"Ali to Warner, SIX runs","full toss, and he goes down the ground. Just clears Hetmyer at long on! You can't miss your length to these two on this form"
10.3,"Ali to Bairstow, 1 run","short, and he swings this away towards deep midwicket, but it bounces ahead of the fielder there"
10.2,"Ali to Warner, 1 run","short, and down the leg side and he swings this around to long leg. Will be disappointed that he only picks up one for this"
10.1,"Ali to Warner, 2 runs","short ball, and he goes back and lofts this towards extra cover. They pick up two comfortably, and even think about a third. But they decide against it"
9.6,"Grandhomme to Warner, 1 run","length on off stump, pushed through mid-off on the up"
9.5,"Grandhomme to Bairstow, 1 run","inside edge to short fine. Length outside off, throws his hands at this but can't connect well enough"
9.4,"Grandhomme to Bairstow, SIX runs","third hundred stand in a row! Served up nicely again from CDG. Slower ball, short - he clubs from underneath and sends it way over long-on"
9.3,"Grandhomme to Bairstow, SIX runs","buh-bye! That is a filthy ball. Attempted slower one, dropped short and down leg side. Waits and waits and pumps it over the square leg boundary"
9.2,"Grandhomme to Warner, 1 run","full slower ball at off stump, jammed down to long-off"
9.1,"Grandhomme to Bairstow, 1 run","attempted slower ball is a full toss, lines up and punches it down to long-off"

8.5,"Ray Barman to Bairstow, 2 runs","length at leg stump, pushed through square leg off the back foot"
8.4,"Ray Barman to Bairstow, FOUR runs","paddles it fine and brings up fifty! Second fiddle so far, but today he's taken the bowling on. And he's sized up the teenager. Gets low - the line is always going to be at the stumps - and exposes the stumps to pick his gap"
8.3,"Ray Barman to Bairstow, FOUR runs","misfield from long-on after he makes the ground to his right. It's a full ball on middle stump, he plonks the front leg out and drives firmly against the turn. A tumble and a hand from the fielder, but not quite a stop"
8.2,"Ray Barman to Bairstow, SIX runs","gorgeous! Lovely clean hit from a lovely clean blade. Bairstow reaches out at this length ball outside off, stands tall and pumps it over the extra cover boundary. Regal."
8.1,"Ray Barman to Warner, 1 run","looks to reverse and can't get it past short third. Length in the corridor, has a whip at it, but it's a slow pace and once again he can't get it away"
7.6,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run","length at leg stump, stays in the crease and flicks to deep square"
7.5,"Chahal to Warner, no run","length at middle stump, beats him in flight. Warner steps out and is forced to defend back towards the bowler"
7.4,"Chahal to Warner, 2 runs","length on leg stump, gently pushed to deep midwicket's right and they steal a second this time"
7.3,"Chahal to Bairstow, 1 run","pick-up, turn, throw. AB sprints to his left to retrieve a pull on the bounce at deep midwicket, and somehow manages to keep this to one. Dropped short from Chahal"
7.2,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run","length at the stumps, allows it to come on and drops it pitch side"
7.1,"Chahal to Bairstow, 1 run","length outside off, dragged to deep midwicket with a sweep on the up"
6.6,"Ray Barman to Warner, 2 runs","short of a length at off stump, pulled strategically between long-on and deep midwicket"
6.5,"Ray Barman to Bairstow, 1 run","get out of the way Davey! No headbutts incoming, but he's nearly taken out Warner with this drive. Full on off and he bludgeons it to long-on, getting Warner hopping at the other end in the process"
6.4,"Ray Barman to Warner, 1 run",short of a length and flat. Marginal turn in at the hips. Dropped into the leg side with soft hands
6.3,"Ray Barman to Bairstow, 1 run","length, flatter at middle stump. Steps out and pushes to long-on"
6.2,"Ray Barman to Bairstow, no run",nice loopy length ball again. This one skids on as he flicks with soft hands to midwicket
6.1,"Ray Barman to Warner, 1 run",floated up at a length outside off and turn into middle stump. Flicks to short fne's right
5.6,"Siraj to Bairstow, no run","yorker length, tapped back down the pitch"
5.5,"Siraj to Bairstow, no run","length on leg stump, flicked straight to midwicket"
5.4,"Siraj to Bairstow, no run","length in the corridor, hurriedly tapped into the covers"
5.3,"Siraj to Bairstow, FOUR runs",in control this time! That's poor bowling. Short and very wide. Doesn't even bother keeping this cut shot down. Flies between backward point and cover
5.2,"Siraj to Bairstow, FOUR runs","just evade mid-off. He has the runs, but he hasn't always been in control. Length outside off. goes on the rise and the bat turns in his hand as this slice clears Barman and runs away"
5.1,"Siraj to Bairstow, no run","yorker in the corridor, jams the bat down on it. Gets it to Hetmyer on the bounce at backward point"
4.6,"Yadav to Bairstow, 1 run","length on middle stump, punched on the rise to long-on"
4.5,"Yadav to Bairstow, FOUR runs","nicely put away and that's their third 50-plus stand in a row. Short and wide from Umesh. Point is in, third man is in. YJB bisects them perfectly. The only decision they have to make is who will go to retrieve it"
4.4,"Yadav to Bairstow, no run","bouncer down leg side, ducks under it"
4.3,"Yadav to Warner, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
4.2,"Yadav to Bairstow, 1 run","slower ball at a length on middle stump, watchfully clips this past short fine"
4.1,"Yadav to Warner, 1 run",leading edge safely past extra cover! Warner closes the face too early on this flick as the ball rises across him in the corridor
3.6,"Siraj to Bairstow, no run","length outside off, looks to chop on the rise, can't beat Hetmyer's leap at backward point"
3.5,"Siraj to Bairstow, FOUR runs",uppish and into the third man boundary. Short and in the corridor. Gets up to cut and gets it off the thick outside edge
3.4,"Siraj to Bairstow, FOUR runs",lobs it over square leg off the inside half. Length ball coming in and rising up. He swishes across the line and gets it into the boundary
3.3,"Siraj to Warner, 1 run","slower ball at a length on leg stump, nudged through backward square"
3.2,"Siraj to Bairstow, 1 run","length ball slanted in at off stump, punched off the toe-end towards mid-on"

2.6,"Chahal to Warner, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked with soft hands into the midwicket region"
2.5,"Chahal to Warner, FOUR runs",superb. A bit of a dance to make room. Chahal marginally short of a length outside off and Warner has done enough to free his arms and pummel him in front of point
2.4,"Chahal to Warner, 2 runs","length on leg stump, flicked with the turn to long-on's left"
2.3,"Chahal to Warner, 2 runs","length at middle stump, ripping in at leg stump. Expertly pokes this into the vacant midwicket region with soft hands"
2.2,"Chahal to Warner, no run","finds square leg this time. Similar delivery, spinning in from a length. Check-sweep to the fielder"
2.1,"Chahal to Warner, 2 runs",length and turning in at leg stump. Gets low and caresses this to deep midwicket's left with a closed face
1.6,"Yadav to Bairstow, no run","length on leg stump, looks to flick and cops this on the thigh"
1.5,"Yadav to Bairstow, no run","length and a bit of wobble as this slants in to Bairstow. Everyone in world cricket knows that's the ball you bowl to him these days. Stands tall and punches to mid-on, albeit with a gap between bat and body"
1.4,"Yadav to Warner, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length in the corridor. Forces him to check his shot - he wanted to punch that through cover. Extra cover falls to his right and gets a hand, but can't stop the single"
1.3,"Yadav to Warner, no run","length on middle stump, flicks across the angle and finds midwicket"
1.2,"Yadav to Warner, no run","length outside off, sliced on the rise to point"
1.1,"Yadav to Warner, SIX runs","go fetch that! Warner was set 12 hours ago. Umesh bowls length in the corridor and the front leg is out of the way as he lifts it on the rise, straight and over the boundary"
0.6,"Ali to Bairstow, FOUR runs","slapped behind square on the off side. More flat stuff, more skid off the pitch with no turn. Lots of width on this occasion too and for once, Bairstow gets ahead of Warner on the scoring. Deep into the crease and gratefully put away with a square cut"
0.5,"Ali to Warner, 1 run","length and into the body, nudged in front of square leg with the angle"
0.4,"Ali to Warner, FOUR runs","off we go. Length on off stump, too flat to cause issues for Warner who gets his front leg into the leg side and gently lofts this over extra cover"
0.3,"Ali to Bairstow, 1 run","length outside off, steps out and taps through the open midwicket region"
0.2,"Ali to Bairstow, FOUR runs","swiped away. Kohli probably went Moeen expecting Warner to take strike. Turns out it's Bairstow's big stride that meets  Mo. Outside off at a length, ends up past square leg and into the boundary"
0.1,"Ali to Bairstow, no run","length just outside off, backs away and looks to punch through cover. Mistimed"
19.6,"Kuldeep to Ingram, 1 run, OUT","IT IS A SUPER OVER. Ingram went across a bit, Kuldeep pitched it on length just outside leg and Ingram swept it away, as Uthappa swooped in on the ball in the deep. Accurate throw, Ingram takes too much time to turn around for the second and he can't make it"
19.5,"Kuldeep to Vihari, OUT","he has found the fielder in the deep, who else but Shubman Gill. What a match this has turned out to be all of a sudden. Short ball, pulled away and it went straight to deep midwicket off Vihari's bat"
19.4,"Kuldeep to Ingram, 1 run","some width outside off, chipped down the ground for one"
19.3,"Kuldeep to Ingram, no run",this one turns away from Ingram and beats the outside edge. He brings his back leg back just in time
19.2,"Kuldeep to Ingram, 2 runs","that was a run-out chance and Kuldeep has fluffed it! Ingram punched it through the covers and they came back for the second, the throw was accurate and reached Kuldeep with Vihari not there yet but he didn't collect the ball"
19.1,"Kuldeep to Vihari, 1 run","flat and quick towards off, worked to leg for one"
18.6,"Ferguson to Vihari, 1 run",waits for the ball to come to him from outside off and steers it late to third man
18.5,"Ferguson to Ingram, 1 run","looked like a legcutter from middle and leg, Ingram made some room and took a single with a defence"
18.4,"Ferguson to Ingram, FOUR runs","short and angling away from Ingram, he goes after it and pulls it away to the deep midwicket boundary from the middle of the bat"
18.3,"Ferguson to Shaw, OUT","oh he's gone for 99, would you believe it. Ferguson was bowling one short delivery after another, this one angling in towards Shaw's head, he pulls, gets a top edge and Dinesh Karthik goes back a few steps towards short third man and takes the skier. Shaw is utterly disappointed with that, he would have been the youngest centurion in IPL"
18.2,"Ferguson to Ingram, 1 run","reaches deep point after a bounce. Short and wide outside off, Ingram sent it flying to deep point"
18.1,"Ferguson to Shaw, 1 run","short ball to Shaw now, he pulls but gets an inside edge onto his right shoulder. Takes the blow and a single"
18.1,"Ferguson to Shaw, 1 wide","strays well down the leg side, it's a wide well taken by Karthik"
17.6,"Kuldeep to Shaw, 1 run","dropped by Kuldeep although that went very quickly to him. Low full toss to Shaw, he slammed it back and Kuldeep hardly had any time to react to go to his right. He'll keep strike"
17.5,"Kuldeep to Pant, OUT","he's found the fielder in the deep! He pitched that waayy outside leg, Pant went closer to it, slog-swept while taking one hand off but didn't get much distance and holed out to deep midwicket"
17.4,"Kuldeep to Pant, no run",hits Pant right in front of the stumps through his sweep but it pitched well outside leg
17.3,"Kuldeep to Pant, no run","turning away outside off from the stumps, Pant pulls and misses"
17.2,"Kuldeep to Shaw, 1 run",he tries to sweep from well outside off but gets a bottom edge for one as it was the wrong'un
17.1,"Kuldeep to Pant, 1 run","he moves down and towards leg, the ball turns towards middle and off, he adjusts and defends for a single"
16.6,"Prasidh to Pant, 1 run","short ball angling in from around the wicket, Pant swivels and pulls it behind square for one"
16.5,"Prasidh to Shaw, 1 run","low and wide full toss, he sends it to third man for one"
16.4,"Prasidh to Shaw, FOUR runs","that's gone through Russell! Shaw drove that straight and full delivery down the ground with a neat straight drive, Russell ran to his left form long-on, even bent to to get both his hands on it but it went right through him. It wasn't a 100% effort though, either because of his left shoulder or his hamstring"
16.3,"Prasidh to Shaw, FOUR runs","he's collecting runs everywhere and in every fashion. Wide full toss outside off as draw made room, he went hard at it and got a thick outside edge, fine enough on the off side for four more"
16.2,"Prasidh to Shaw, 2 runs","towards leg again, he works it behind square for two more in the gap"
16.1,"Prasidh to Shaw, FOUR runs","strays down the leg side, Shaw wants to send it fine on the leg side for four, and he does so successfully"
15.6,"Ferguson to Shaw, 1 run","finally a full delivery in the over, Shaw drills it towards mid-off from just outside off where Russell dives to his left to save three runs. He landed on his left shoulder, which had taken a blow when he was batting earlier today"
15.5,"Ferguson to Shaw, 2 runs","one short ball after another. Seeing the ball coming towards him, Shaw pulls it a bit wide of long on for two more"
15.4,"Ferguson to Shaw, FOUR runs","third man is in, so Shaw makes room for the short ball and cuts it with hard hands to send it flying over short third man for four"
15.3,"Ferguson to Shaw, no run","another short ball, this one straighter and Shaw pulls and misses this time"
15.2,"Ferguson to Shaw, FOUR runs","bangs in a bouncer, Shaw is hurried for pace but he pivots on the back foot and hooks just in time to get four runs fine on the leg side"
15.1,"Ferguson to Pant, 1 run","another chance for a run-out, this goes to the third umpire too. Pant pulled the short ball to leg, it went towards deep square leg and the throw came in fast towards Karthik who collected well and took the bails off but Shaw's bat has just dragged in with his dive"
14.6,"Chawla to Shaw, 2 runs","flicked away to the leg side now, it's against the turn and in the gap to let them come back for the second"
14.5,"Chawla to Shaw, FOUR runs","it's the wrong'un from outside off and Shaw picks it well, it's short too, to loft it over the covers with some power and punch. In the gap for four"
14.4,"Chawla to Pant, 1 run","fuller on the stumps now, pushed down to long-on"
14.3,"Chawla to Pant, no run","lbw appeal this time as he moves across to swat it, but it was probably going over"
14.2,"Chawla to Pant, no run","flatter delivery going wide of off stump, Pant goes for the reverse hit and misses it completely, it's wide of the wide crease but not given because he changed his stance"
14.1,"Chawla to Shaw, 1 run","coming in with the angle from off and middle, worked away to leg for one"
13.6,"Prasidh to Pant, no run","makes room this time and Krishna responds with a wide delivery outside off, Pant almost loses his balance while smashing it to mid-off"
13.5,"Prasidh to Pant, FOUR runs","slow for Pant too, it's outside leg, and Pant swats it to his favourite area - behind square on the leg side to beat long leg. Impressive wrist work there"
13.4,"Prasidh to Shaw, 1 run","slower ball at 108.6kmh that's a little short, Shaw waits before pulling it to deep midwicket"
13.3,"Prasidh to Pant, 1 run","full on off stump, driven down with a little power to long-on"
13.2,"Prasidh to Shaw, 1 run","in the block hole, nice and accurate, Shaw digs it out to long-on for one"
13.1,"Prasidh to Shaw, no run","some room on the off side, Shaw drives hard and finds cover"
12.6,"Rana to Pant, 2 runs","bit of mix up for the second run, almost a run-out chance for Pant as he came back for the second but he's made it. Pant drilled that fuller delivery through the covers, it was in the gap and he hesitated a bit for the second after turning around but saw Shaw coming back so took off too. Luckily the throw came at the bowler's end first and he reached by the time it came to the keeper"
12.5,"Rana to Shaw, 1 run","just fuller than length outside off, shaw whips it to long-on"
12.4,"Rana to Pant, 1 leg bye","slower through the air and going down leg, he nudges it fine for one"
12.3,"Rana to Pant, no run",stays low as it turns away a bit from outside off. Pant defends it back with a hint of surprise
12.2,"Rana to Shaw, 1 run","fuller and closer to the stumps, flicks with hard hands again"
12.1,"Rana to Shaw, FOUR runs","outside off, there's some width and Shaw cuts it a bit late and with hard hands as it kept low to beat backward point for four"
11.6,"Russell to Iyer, OUT","Gill takes it this time, a tougher chance at the same position, and he kind of celebrates but the this umpire will check if his left leg was touching the boundary cushion. Iyer lifted that ball in the air with another flick as it was full again, Gill stayed still and this time caught it over his head while watching where his left leg was. Soft signal was out and the third umpire also says it's out"
11.5,"Russell to Iyer, FOUR runs","still quite full, this time on the off side and Iyer drives it in the air over the covers and finds the gap properly this time for another four"
11.4,"Russell to Iyer, FOUR runs","Gill drops a sitter at deep midwicket. How much will that cost KKR? Iyer picked that full delivery from the stumps and flicked it with really good timing but for placement, it was headed straight to Gill in the deep and he just dropped it"
11.3,"Russell to Shaw, 1 run","angling in and Shaw works it to leg again, this time for one"
11.2,"Russell to Shaw, FOUR runs","minor error from Russell and Shaw flicks it away with disdain off his toes, behind square for four in the gap. It was an attempted yorker, Shaw walked across a bit and flicked it to perfection"
11.1,"Russell to Iyer, 1 run","slower one at 114.5kmh on the stumps, he walks across and flicks wide of long-on"
10.6,"Kuldeep to Shaw, FOUR runs","full on middle, it's not the wrong'un so Shaw goes down on a knee and sweeps it very well with the turn, in the gap, and beats long leg for four. What an over to bring up his fifty, off 30 balls"
10.5,"Kuldeep to Shaw, 2 runs",goes deep in the crease for the fuller one on leg and works it to leg for two more
10.4,"Kuldeep to Shaw, SIX runs","excellent execution over the covers! He stepped out early, Kuldeep pitched it wide outside off and Shaw confidently lofted that inside-out over the covers for a clean six"
10.3,"Kuldeep to Iyer, 1 run","much quicker at 107kmh and full on leg, he flicks but gets an edge into the off side for one"
10.2,"Kuldeep to Iyer, SIX runs","really short, hardly any bounce, going straight with the angle on leg stump, and Iyer transfers his weight on the back foot to pull that over deep midwicket for six!"
10.1,"Kuldeep to Shaw, 1 run",outside the leg stump and Shaw sweeps with really hard hands to long leg for one
9.6,"Ferguson to Shaw, 1 run","slower ball, picks it and swings but only gets an inside edge towards the keeper"
9.5,"Ferguson to Shaw, no run","length outside off, punched stylishly but straight to point"
9.4,"Ferguson to Iyer, 1 run","length on off, Iyer makes a little room and guides it down to third-man"
9.4,"Ferguson to Iyer, 1 wide","length and down the leg side, called wide but Iyer might feel he missed a boundary opportunity"
9.3,"Ferguson to Iyer, no run","shorter and angled in, Iyer attempts the ramp but misses"
9.2,"Ferguson to Iyer, FOUR runs","short on middle, doesn't get high enough and that's easy pickings for Iyer, as he swivels and pulls it hard in front of square"

8.3,"Chawla to Iyer, SIX runs","full on the pads and Iyer is getting a measure of the bowling now, picks it up with the angle, gets the elevation and a lot of distance, launching it over deep midwicket"
8.2,"Chawla to Shaw, 1 run","googly, spins back in from off, pushed to long-off"
8.1,"Chawla to Iyer, 1 run","length outside off, a rare leg break from Chawla, pushed to point's right"
7.6,"Kuldeep to Shaw, SIX runs",googly seemed to have deceived him but it was quite full and Shaw got nicely under it and sent it sailing down the ground for six!
7.5,"Kuldeep to Iyer, 1 run","length on off, pushed to long-off"
7.4,"Kuldeep to Iyer, FOUR runs","too full on off, overpitched and Iyer hammers it down the ground, past the bowler, bisecting long-off and long-on"
7.3,"Kuldeep to Shaw, 1 run","length on off, Shaw really has to wait for that before pulling it along the ground to long-on"
7.2,"Kuldeep to Iyer, 1 run","down the wicket, deceived by the googly as he swings wildly, but luckily for him manages to get some bat on it down to short third-man"

5.4,"Russell to Shaw, no run","length on middle, Shaw punches it straight back to the bowler"
5.3,"Russell to Shaw, SIX runs",length on off and how quickly was he into position there! Hammers a pull in front of square and it carries all the way

4.6,"Prasidh to Shaw, no run","length on off, hurries onto Shaw, who looks to pull it, ends up swatting it back to the bowler, who does well to change direction, dive to his right to stop that"
4.5,"Prasidh to Iyer, 1 run","length on middle, tucked away towards squareleg for one"
4.5,"Prasidh to Iyer, 1 wide","full toss down the leg side, loses his radar, perhaps because Iyer was moving around the crease a lot"

1.4,"Ferguson to Shaw, FOUR runs","slower ball, floated up on middle, uses his wrists and picks it up towards deep squareleg and the timing was excellent"
1.3,"Ferguson to Shaw, no run","length on off, opens the face and pushes it to point's right"
1.2,"Ferguson to S Dhawan, 1 run","length outside off, swatted towards mid-on without any timing and they scamper one"
1.1,"Ferguson to S Dhawan, no run","length outside off, doesn't come on, Dhawan throws his bat at it and gets a thick inside edge back to the bowler"
0.6,"Prasidh to Shaw, FOUR runs","short on middle, came really slowly, Shaw gets into position and hammers a pull in front of square"
0.5,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, 1 run","length outside off, Dhawan predicts it, charges down the wicket and slashes and it goes flat down to third-man on one bounce"
0.4,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, no run","slower ball outside off, pushed to mid-off"
0.3,"Prasidh to Shaw, 1 run","length at the body, cramping him for room, awkwardly pushed towards midwicket"
0.2,"Prasidh to Shaw, no run","length outside off, goes for the cut but only manages to chop it back to the keeper"
0.1,"Prasidh to Shaw, no run","short outside off, appreciable lift from the wicket, Shaw slashes and misses"
19.6,"Rabada to Chawla, 1 run, OUT","fullish to end the innings, he sends it down the ground to long-on and Kuldeep, for some reason, was saying 'no' for the second run, to be run-out ultimately"
19.5,"Rabada to Chawla, FOUR runs","short and quick, Chawla takes his eyes off the ball at end but gets enough bat with an awkward pull and it beats the fine-leg fielder for four"
19.4,"Rabada to Kuldeep, 1 run","in the block hole on the leg stump, Kuldeep gets an edge to fine leg for one"
19.3,"Rabada to Kuldeep, 2 runs","on the pads, it's full, and he flicks it nicely towards wide long-on for two more"
19.2,"Rabada to Kuldeep, 2 runs",short ball now and Kuldeep pulls it towards long-off where a misfield helps him come back for the second
19.1,"Rabada to Kuldeep, FOUR runs","tries the yorker outside off, turns out it's a low full toss and Kuldeep steers it wide of short third man for four. Nice placement"
18.6,"Mishra to Chawla, no run","length delivery on middle and leg, Chawla tries to sweep with the turn again but misses this time"
18.5,"Mishra to Kuldeep, 1 run","on middle and leg, Kuldeep reverse-paddles it to short third man for one"
18.4,"Mishra to Karthik, OUT","tries to cut it late, it's much slower through the air, turns away from Karthik outside off and he edges to the keeper and walks"
18.3,"Mishra to Karthik, SIX runs","this time on middle and leg, Karthik goes down on a knee and sweeps that before it can turn, over long leg for six!"
18.3,"Mishra to Karthik, 1 wide","pitches well outside off, tuns away further for a wide"
18.2,"Mishra to Chawla, 1 run","well outside off now, he tickles it to short third man for one"
18.1,"Mishra to Chawla, SIX runs",how's that for a first-ball six? Piyush Chawla picks this delivery up from leg side and slog-sweeps it with the turn over square leg for a six
17.6,"Morris to Karthik, no run","bit down the leg side, it deflect off the pad and goes fine before Pant dives to his left and saves four"
17.5,"Morris to Russell, OUT","finally, they've managed to dismiss him! Back to the short ball, Russell pulled, got a top-edge and it went high towards fine leg. Rabada ran from the circle and bumped into Tewatia who came in from the deep and took the catch rather easily. No damage done to either of them, thankfully, Rabada was only ball-watching"
17.4,"Morris to Russell, FOUR runs","where do you bowl to him? From wide of the crease, this is a yorker just outside off stump, Russell makes some room and steers it wide of point for four in the gap"
17.3,"Morris to Russell, 2 runs","Pant is appealing for Russell's run-out, but he's safe. Morring banged in a short ball, Russell pulled it and then came back quickly to make it back just in time"
17.2,"Morris to Russell, FOUR runs","length delivery on middle and leg, Russell makes room and smashes to the leg side, obviously, wide of deep midwicket again"
17.1,"Morris to Karthik, 1 run","Dinesh Karthik has fallen on the ground twice on the same delivery! First he gets a yorker from Morris and loses his balance while working the ball to leg. He gets up, runs across for the single and then dives at the other end to complete the single just in time"
16.6,"Rabada to Karthik, 1 run",bit of width outside off and he drives it nicely into the covers for one
16.5,"Rabada to Karthik, no run",almost in the block hole again and he defends it back
16.4,"Rabada to Russell, 1 run","accurate line on the off stump, not much room and he pushes it to leg for one"
16.3,"Rabada to Russell, FOUR runs","he tries the short ball, Russell's arm speed is quick and he pulls it wide of deep midwicket by opening up his body. And that's another fifty, off 23 balls"
16.2,"Rabada to Karthik, 1 run","nicely done by Rabada, in the block hole on off and Karthik blocks it for a single"
16.1,"Rabada to Karthik, no run","almost a run-out chance as Karthik dabbed the ball to short third man and didn't even look at Russell, who ran more than halfway down the pitch. But got back safe thanks to an inaccurate throw"
15.6,"Patel to Russell, SIX runs","and another one, in the same place! In the same slot where the fifth ball was pitched, there comes the big back-lift, the big swing and there vanishes the ball on the leg side. This six looked even bigger"
15.6,"Patel to Russell, 1 wide",it has thrown the line off a long way. Slower delivery goes waayy outside off for a wide. Russell been considered chasing and smashing it
15.5,"Patel to Russell, SIX runs","right in the slot for him, it's full, in his arc and Russell dispatches that with tons of power on his favoured leg side. Goes a long, long way over wide long-on"
15.4,"Patel to Karthik, 1 run","short ball follows the full delivery again, pulled to deep midwicket for one more"
15.3,"Patel to Russell, 1 run","tries the yorker, almost in the slot, and Russell swings it to deep midwicket"
15.2,"Patel to Karthik, 1 run",short ball this time and he slap-pulls it to long-on
15.1,"Patel to Karthik, FOUR runs","too full some of these deliveries, and Karthik drives that nicely into the covers by transferring the weight of his body. Right in the gap for four"
14.6,"Morris to Russell, SIX runs","it's difficult to stop even an injure Dre Russ! Full delivery, he stands tall and lofts that straight down the ground, over the bowler, almost over the sight screen for six"
14.5,"Morris to Russell, 4 leg byes","he resumes, he runs in and sends this one down the leg side, past the batsman and the keeper for four, off the pads"
14.4,"Morris to Russell, FOUR runs","right in the block hole outside off, Russell makes room and jams his bat down horizontally to get enough inside edge for four fine on the leg side"
14.3,"Morris to Karthik, 1 run","some width outside off, Karthik runs it down to third man"
14.2,"Morris to Russell, 1 run","short, but not very short, so Russell is unable to time the pull properly to long-on"
14.1,"Morris to Karthik, 1 run","full on off, driven down with a straight bat to long-on"
13.6,"Patel to Karthik, 1 run","bangs in the short ball, Karthik pulls to deep midwicket"
13.5,"Patel to Russell, 1 run","lobs the ball in the air towards mid-off as he checks his shot at the last moment. It was a change of pace from Harshal, for the length delivery outside off"
13.4,"Patel to Karthik, 1 run",tucks that one behind square easily for one
13.3,"Patel to Russell, 1 run","holed out to deep midwicket, easy catch for the fielder and they take a single. Russell pulled that slow bouncer without any hesitation"
13.3,"Patel to Russell, (no ball)","that's a beamer that's hit Russell hard and straight on the left shoulder. Russell is flat on the ground! Not sure if it slipped out of Harshal's hand or anything else, it went straight towards Russell who took his eyes off the ball and took the blow. Nothing serious there, hopefully. Russell is up again, but being tended to by the physio. He's popping a pill now"
13.2,"Patel to Russell, no run","big, wild swing for the wide delivery outside off. He misses it completely"
13.1,"Patel to Russell, no run","back of length outside off, it's punched into the covers"
12.6,"Mishra to Karthik, no run",a forward lean and he steers that one towards point after it turns away
12.5,"Mishra to Russell, 1 run",slams this wider delivery with some power to long-on. It raced to him
12.4,"Mishra to Russell, no run",he doesn't move his feet at all for the googly. It turns in from well outside off and beats the bat
12.3,"Mishra to Karthik, 1 run",goes back this time and cuts the shorter delivery to deep cover
12.2,"Mishra to Karthik, FOUR runs","little too full on middle, Karthik takes a step forward and uses his wrists beautiful to drive it on the leg side, between long on and deep midwicket. Excellent timing and placement"
12.1,"Mishra to Karthik, no run",small step forward and he defends the legbreak from outside off towards point
11.6,"Lamichhane to Russell, SIX runs",that's a legbreak and it's so wide and full outside off that Russell confidently goes down on a knee and tonks that straight down the ground. Over long-off this time
11.5,"Lamichhane to Russell, SIX runs","wrong'un again, this time Russell smashes it with the turn, not from the middle, but his arms are so powerful it sails over deep midwicket for six. Not even sure if he picked the googly"
11.4,"Lamichhane to Karthik, 1 run",the wrong'un turns in and Kathik leans forward to nudge it to leg
11.3,"Lamichhane to Karthik, FOUR runs","similar line but not with as much turn, it's shorter though so Karthik rocks back in the crease to open up and slams that through the midwicket area in the gap for four"
11.2,"Lamichhane to Karthik, no run","touch closer to off stump, DK waits and then guides it to short third man"
11.1,"Lamichhane to Karthik, no run","quickish legbreak outside leg, he cuts it straight to point"
10.6,"Mishra to Karthik, 1 run","full on the pads, taps it on its head and gets a single down to short fine-leg"
10.5,"Mishra to Karthik, no run",
10.4,"Mishra to Russell, 1 run","shorter and quicker, Russell rocks back to pull, is early into the stroke and only manages a thick inside edge to long-on"
10.3,"Mishra to Russell, SIX runs","And here we go! full on off, right in the slot, the right pace as well, Russell hammers it flat and hard over long-off"
10.2,"Mishra to Russell, no run","googly outside off, really really slow, Russell hangs back, picks it after pitching and defends"
10.1,"Mishra to Karthik, 1 run","length on off, Karthik lunges forward and pushes at it with hard hands, gets a thick inside edge to long-on"
9.6,"Lamichhane to Russell, no run","length outside off, punched to cover"
9.5,"Lamichhane to Karthik, 1 run","length on the stumps, used the depth of the crease and turns it around towards deep squareleg"

9.3,"Lamichhane to Russell, no run","length on off, flat again, defended"
9.2,"Lamichhane to Karthik, 1 run","googly, flatter on the stumps, Karthik goes deep in his crease and tucks it away to deep squareleg"
9.1,"Lamichhane to Gill, 2 runs, OUT","full outside off, comes forward and throws his hands at it, deceived by the sharp spin away, gets a thick outside edge to deep point's left, who puts in an excellent dive on the boundary before flicking it to Harshal Patel, who was giving chase along with Rabada and hurled it back flat and right over the stumps the non striker's end to find Gill short of his ground on the attempted third run"
8.6,"Mishra to Karthik, FOUR runs","tossed up outside off, Karthik comes down hard on it, and chops between the keeper and slip, as it races away to the third-man fence"
8.5,"Mishra to Gill, 1 run","length outside off, pushed to long-off"
8.4,"Mishra to Gill, no run","full outside off, pushed to cover"
8.3,"Mishra to Gill, no run","tossed up outside off, googly, drawing him forward, gets an inside edge past the stumps, however"
8.2,"Mishra to Karthik, 1 run","length on off, keeps low but he manages to turn it around towards midwicket"
8.1,"Mishra to Karthik, no run","length on middle, defended"
7.6,"Patel to Karthik, 1 run","length outside off, Karthik rocks back and hammers a pull to long-on's right but he manages to get around it to keep to a single"
7.5,"Patel to Gill, 1 run","slower ball on the pads, clipped away to deep squareleg"
7.4,"Patel to Karthik, 1 run","slower ball outside off, opens the face and steers it down to third-man"
7.3,"Patel to Karthik, SIX runs",length on the pads and he nonchalantly helps it along over fine-leg for six! It didn't quite come on again but somehow Karthik manages to time that as well
7.2,"Patel to Karthik, no run","full on the pads, clipped to midwicket"
7.1,"Patel to Rana, OUT","clipped away to fine-leg and  brilliantly taken by Rabada running swiftly to his right! It was an innocuous delivery on the pads, Rana picked it up nicely and perhaps surprised himself with the timing, his problem was that it went flat and aerially towards Rabada, who made it look incredibly easy"
6.6,"Rabada to Karthik, FOUR runs",full on the pads and what a way to get going! Clipped away to deep squareleg's left with the kind of timing nobody has found on this two-paced surface
6.5,"Rabada to Lynn, OUT","gloved and brilliantly taken by Pant diving to his left! It wasn't just the dive but the way he took a couple of steps to his left before putting in the dive that allowed him to get there and pluck it out of thin air. Bouncer from Rabada, directed at the body, Lynn attempted to hook it away but only managed to glove it behind"
6.4,"Rabada to Lynn, 2 runs","slower ball, full on the pads, clipped away to deep squareleg's right and they complete a well-run couple"
6.3,"Rabada to Rana, 1 run","length outside off, opens the face and steers it down to third-man"

6.1,"Rabada to Lynn, no run","length on middle, nips back in a touch, Lynn is beaten by the pace and struck on the thigh pad"
5.6,"Patel to Uthappa, OUT","appeal for lbw and given! slower ball, full on off, grips a little and Uthappa is not only early into the stroke but due to the press forward and across, has to play around his front pad, doesn't manage to get any bat on it and is found dead in front"
5.5,"Patel to Uthappa, FOUR runs","length outside off, too much width, it's also his normal, seam-up delivery, Uthappa slashes and beats point"
5.4,"Patel to Lynn, 1 run","slower ball on off, walks across and chips it towards mid-on with no timing, which allows a single"
5.3,"Patel to Lynn, no run","length on middle, tries to help it along past short fine-leg with the angle but can't beat the man"
5.2,"Patel to Lynn, no run","slower ball on off, holds in the surface, Lynn pushes at it with hard hands but the aerial drive just eludes the bowler to his left in his follow through"
5.1,"Patel to Uthappa, 1 run","full on the pads, clipped away to deep squareleg for one"
4.6,"Morris to Lynn, no run","full toss on the pads, he was probably a little surprised by it as he misses the flick and is struck on the thigh pad"

3.5,"Lamichhane to Uthappa, FOUR runs","full outside off, turn away from him but he uses it to his advantage, opens the face to find the gap through cover-point and gets off the mark with four"
3.4,"Lamichhane to Naik, OUT","appeal for lbw and given! It looked like the googly, he prodded forward tentatively and played down the wrong line as it spun back into him. He reviews but in vain as it would have crashed into leg stump"
3.3,"Lamichhane to Naik, no run",
3.2,"Lamichhane to Naik, no run","full outside off, comes down the wicket and tries to blast him over the off side, gets a thick inside edge, back onto his foot and the keeper retrieves"

2.6,"Morris to Naik, no run","full on off, down the wicket comes Naik and drills it to mid-off. Perhaps got too close to it with the use of the feet"

1.5,"Lamichhane to Naik, no run","full outside off, lunges forward and defends"
1.4,"Lamichhane to Naik, no run","Massive appeal for caught behind turned down and Delhi opt for the review! Length outside off, looks to late cut it as it hurries on to him, but there was absolutely nothing there and the decision is upheld"

1.2,"Lamichhane to Naik, no run","googly on off, waits on it and opens the face to steer it to slip along the ground"

0.6,"Rabada to Lynn, 2 runs",
0.5,"Rabada to Lynn, FOUR runs","length outside off, Lynn doesn't move his feet, stays leg side of the ball and defends but the timing is so good that it races away to the cover fence"
0.4,"Rabada to Lynn, no run","edged and just short of Dhawan at slip! Length outside off, pokes at it with his feet rooted to the crease but the nick falls well short of Dhawan, who was quite deep"

18.1,"Bumrah to Rahul, FOUR runs","back of a length, not too far outside off, and third man is back, but he's fairly square, and Bumrah offers Rahul plenty of pace to use, just opens his bat face and guides it down nice and fine"
17.6,"McClenaghan to Miller, FOUR runs","makes room premeditatedly, and leaves McClenaghan with two options - follow him or make him reach for the ball. Goes for option two, with a full one outside off, but it's still within his reach and he frees his arms to slap it away to the left of deep point"
17.6,"McClenaghan to Miller, 1 wide","looks for the yorker, ends up sliding a low full-toss down the leg side. That brings up the 50 partnership, off just 30 balls"

17.4,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run","sees Rahul trying to make himself room and follows him with a slower, back-of-length ball. Slapped to extra-cover"
17.3,"McClenaghan to Miller, 1 run",late inswing causes this yorker to tail in towards Miller's feet. Nearly falls over while trying to flick it. Thick inside edge into pad

16.3,"Bumrah to Rahul, FOUR runs","and that means there's a gap to exploit between extra-cover and mid-off. Bumrah allows him to with a full-toss close to off stump, and he punches it away through that very gap"

15.4,"Malinga to Rahul, 1 wide","looks for the yorker, gets a bit of late inswing too, but ends up swerving it down the leg side"
15.3,"Malinga to Rahul, 2 runs","short, a bit of width, but the ball loses a lot of pace off the surface so Rahul drags his attempted cut in front of square, to the fielder sweeping on the cover point boundary. More pace onto the bat and a boundary could have been on, with backward point and third man in the circle. Misfield on the boundary allows a second run"
15.2,"Malinga to Miller, 1 run","full on off stump, driven to long-off"
15.1,"Malinga to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball at the pads, clipped away through midwicket"
14.6,"Pandya to Miller, FOUR runs","another boundary, and this may well be the over that wins it for Kings XI. Short, down the leg side, and Miller swivels to use the pace and help it away to the fine leg boundary"
14.5,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 run","fuller still now and outside off, to deny the hit down the ground. Opens his bat face to ease it to deep point"
14.4,"Pandya to Rahul, FOUR runs","overpitched, lots of width, Rahul just hits through the line with a straight bat, and though it's in the air, it's in the gap to the right of Rohit at extra-cover.

14.3,"Pandya to Miller, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, straight-bat push to the right of extra-cover"
14.3,"Pandya to Miller, 1 wide","change of angle, no change in fortunes. He's trying hard to cramp Miller for room, but ends up spearing this full one down the leg side"

14.2,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, worked away to deep square leg"

13.3,"Krunal to Agarwal, OUT","another wicket for Krunal, who's keeping Mumbai in the game here. Back of a length, no turn, keeps going with the angle and cramps up Mayank, who was always looking to stay leg-side of the ball. Punches hard, but ends up popping it back to the bowler at around chest height"
13.2,"Krunal to Agarwal, 2 runs","goes back to the slider angling into leg stump, punches it into the gap between long-on and deep midwicket. Two runs were always on, but Rahul has to dive to complete it at the non-striker's end"
13.1,"Krunal to Agarwal, SIX runs","bam. Flat, full, angling into middle stump. Not full enough to deny Agarwal elevation after he gets his front leg out of the way and swings through the line for a flat six to the right of long-off"
12.6,"Pandya to Agarwal, 1 run","overpitched, a bit of width, and Agarwal will be displeased that he couldn't beat the infield with that drive. Timed it well, to the right of extra-cover but too close to the fielder"
12.5,"Pandya to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball, shorter and again on that wide-ish line, slapped to deep point"
12.4,"Pandya to Rahul, 2 runs","full, a bit of width, and that's nicely played by Rahul, steps back and across to shorten the length and slap it away to the left of McClenaghan, who has to sprint a long way and slide to make the stop at deep point"

11.4,"Krunal to Agarwal, SIX runs","down the track, and that's beautiful timing. Quick feet to get himself close to the pitch of this middle-stump ball but not close enough to deny himself elevation. Swings cleanly through the line and easily clears the long-on boundary"

11.2,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","down the track to a flat one aimed towards off stump. Meets it on the full and slaps it away, and point dives right to get a hand to it and slow it down considerably"

10.5,"McClenaghan to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball angling into middle stump, nudges it gently into the vacant midwicket region, and forces the bowler to chase"
10.4,"McClenaghan to Rahul, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, punched with a straight bat to deep midwicket"
10.3,"McClenaghan to Rahul, 2 runs","length ball angling away from off stump, opens his bat face to squeeze this to the right of the diving Yuvraj at backward point"
10.2,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run","looks for the flick off a length ball angling across to off stump. No timing at all, just clips it back to the bowler"
10.1,"McClenaghan to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball, angling in towards off stump, straightens slightly. Pushed down to long-off"
9.6,"Krunal to Agarwal, 1 leg bye","loud appeal as he is hit int front of leg, it was going down leg"
9.5,"Krunal to Agarwal, 2 runs",goes back to work the ball off his pads to deep midwicket and they come back quickly for the second
9.4,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run",pushed down to long-on for one
9.3,"Krunal to Agarwal, 1 run",flicks this length delivery away towards midwicket for one
9.3,"Krunal to Agarwal, 1 wide","tries to paddle it fine on leg, misses and it's a wide"
9.2,"Krunal to Agarwal, FOUR runs","makes room to target the leg side, not much room on off so he cuts hard but gets a thick inside edge fine on the off side for four"
9.1,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run",length delivery chipped down to long-on for one
8.6,"Markande to Agarwal, FOUR runs","another short ball, doesn't bounce that much and Mayank puts this one away too. In the same gap on the leg side, four more"
8.5,"Markande to Rahul, 1 run","no turn again, angling in towards leg stump and helped to leg for one more"
8.4,"Markande to Agarwal, 1 run","skids this one from off stump, worked to leg for a quick single"
8.3,"Markande to Agarwal, FOUR runs","that's too short, Mayank goes back to open up and pulls it in the gap again. Picks it up from off stump and finds the gap between long on and deep midwicket"
8.2,"Markande to Agarwal, no run","quicker one on off, goes straightish and he pushes it towards cover"
8.2,"Markande to Agarwal, 1 wide","googly down the leg side after pitching on middle, for a wide"
8.1,"Markande to Rahul, 1 run","legbreak outside off, driven with the spin into the covers"
7.6,"Krunal to Agarwal, FOUR runs",smart work and placement from Mayank - length delivery on the stumps and he chips it down the ground with sweet timing to bisect long-on and long-off for a four
7.5,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","towards the pads again, worked away with the wrists"
7.4,"Krunal to Rahul, 2 runs","goes on the back foot and works it to the leg side with soft hands, calls for two immediately"
7.3,"Krunal to Agarwal, 1 run","on middle stump, he pushes it to long-on. Off the mark"
7.2,"Krunal to Gayle, OUT","he's skied that one and picks out long-on, look who's taken the catch - it's Hardik Pandya! This one was pretty wide outside off, hardly any flight, and Gayle went after it to dispatch it down the ground, not easy to smash a wide delivery with the spin. It went really high, and Hardik pouched it easily a few yards inside the boundary"
7.1,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","angling into the pads, he helps it to deep square leg"
6.6,"Pandya to Gayle, no run","another slower one well outside off with the angle, Gayle lets it go and looks at the umpire but it's not called a wide"
6.6,"Pandya to Gayle, 1 wide","slower one well outside off, it rolls away for a wide"
6.5,"Pandya to Gayle, SIX runs","smoked down the ground this time! Pitched up again, Gayle knows what to do with those lengths. He stays still this time and tonks it into the sight screen"
6.4,"Pandya to Gayle, SIX runs","clears that massive square boundary for another six! Pitched up on leg stump and in typical Gayle fashion, Gayle opened up to hammer that with a wild swing. Up and over deep square leg"

6.2,"Pandya to Rahul, no run","pulls the length shorter outside off, Rahul steers it square this time"

5.1,"Bumrah to Gayle, no run","on the pads, he wants to work it away but gets an inside edge on the pads"
4.6,"Malinga to Gayle, 1 run",on the pads and he helps it to deep square for one
4.5,"Malinga to Gayle, FOUR runs",he gets some room on off and waits on the back foot to punch that away between cover point and point for a cracking four
4.4,"Malinga to Gayle, no run","113.9kmh, pitched up around off and he chips it down to mid-off after a bounce"
4.3,"Malinga to Gayle, FOUR runs","nearly in the block hole, and Gayle does extremely well to move his feet out of the way in time and he drives that down the ground past Rahul, right from the middle of the bat. Malinga replies with a smile"
4.2,"Malinga to Gayle, no run","back of length on middle and leg, Gayle pushes it down to mid-off"
4.1,"Malinga to Gayle, no run",just outside off and he punches it into the covers
3.6,"Bumrah to Rahul, no run","drives again, reaching away from the body, and he finds point this time"
3.5,"Bumrah to Rahul, FOUR runs","gets some room finally, not much, and Rahul jumps on it by driving that length delivery nicely along the ground, between cover point and cover for four. Must be a relief for him"
3.4,"Bumrah to Rahul, no run","no room whatsoever still, angling in from wide of the crease and Rahul defends again"
3.3,"Bumrah to Rahul, no run","slower one at 118kmh, outside off and nipping in, Rahul gets an inside edge behind square on leg"
3.2,"Bumrah to Rahul, no run","angling in a bit further towards middle and leg, he helps it to square leg"
3.1,"Bumrah to Rahul, no run",and right on target he is - length delivery angling in from outside off. Rahul defends it back
2.6,"McClenaghan to Rahul, 1 run","114kmh, slower one keeps low on the leg stump, Rahul goes back and helps it to deep square leg"
2.5,"McClenaghan to Rahul, no run","almost cramped for room on the leg side, Rahul works the length delivery to midwicket"
2.4,"McClenaghan to Gayle, 1 run","length delivery this time on the stumps, he works it wide of mid-on in the gap"
2.3,"McClenaghan to Gayle, SIX runs","pitched up this time but for the same result! Almost full on the stumps, it was a cutter, and Gayle stayed still to loft that with his big arms in the same area - clears long-on easily"
2.2,"McClenaghan to Gayle, SIX runs",short ball smacked for six! It's almost like he knew the shorter ball was coming. He planted his front foot towards the leg side as soon as the ball was delivered and he pulled the incoming delivery waaay over the long-on area for a massive six
2.1,"McClenaghan to Rahul, 1 run",outside the leg stump and he nudges it towards midwicket for one
1.6,"Malinga to Gayle, no run",futile yet loud appeal for lbw from Malinga as this quick delivery beats Gayle but he was struck outside the leg stump after he missed the flick. It also pitched outside leg
1.5,"Malinga to Rahul, 1 run","slow cutter on middle stump at 111kmh, Rahul watchfully pushes straight down the ground for one towards mid-on"
1.4,"Malinga to Rahul, no run","swinging away from just outside off, Rahul goes back and defends towards cover point"
1.3,"Malinga to Rahul, no run","outside off on length, Rahul steers it to cover point"
1.2,"Malinga to Gayle, 1 run",bit of mix-up halfway through the pitch as Gayle dabs the slower ball towards backward point and Yuvraj fumbles there to make the batsmen go back and forth. No damage in the end
1.1,"Malinga to Rahul, 1 run","starts with a leg-stump line, Rahul nudges it away to the leg side for one"
0.6,"McClenaghan to Gayle, FOUR runs",short again but it's still outside off and Gayle does well to ramp it with minimal movement of the body. Just raises his arms at the last moment and gets four
0.5,"McClenaghan to Gayle, no run","and short it is! Nicely bowled - around off and rising towards Gayle's throat, so he lets it go by swaying  out of its line"
0.4,"McClenaghan to Gayle, no run","pulls the length shorter outside off, Gayle wants to slam it away on off but doesn't middle it"
0.3,"McClenaghan to Gayle, no run","accurate length delivery outside off, middles the defence on the off side"
0.2,"McClenaghan to Gayle, no run","loud appeal for lbw mainly from the bowler, the umpire doesn't move and Rohit signals from slip that it was too high. It angled in from off, was just short of good length and nipped in to strike the pad high in front of leg stump. Was probably going down leg too"
0.1,"McClenaghan to Rahul, 1 run","length ball, some room on the off side with the angle, Rahul uses soft hands to guide it to third man. Off the mark straightaway"
19.6,"Shami to McClenaghan, 1 leg bye","looks to shuffle across again, and Shami fires in a yorker just outside off. Misses the flick and it rolls away through square leg off the pad"
19.5,"Shami to McClenaghan, no run","McClenaghan takes a big step across, looking to target the fielder at short fine leg. Shami fires a full-toss outside off, pretty close to the batsman's body as he tries to scoop it fine. No contact between bat and ball or ball and body, thankfully"
19.4,"Shami to Pandya, OUT","gone. The bend-your-back short ball is a great ball to bowl on this ground. Gets up to shoulder height outside off stump, and it's a hard place to fetch a pull from. Hits it pretty well, but on this ground you need to hit it better than that to clear the fielder at deep midwicket"
19.3,"Shami to Pandya, 2 runs","full, close to off stump, not quite a yorker, carves it away with an open bat face to the left of deep point, and that's excellent running to pick up a second"
19.2,"Shami to Pandya, SIX runs","slower ball, ends up as a full-toss on off stump, and this is why he refused that single. Again takes that big back-and-across step, which allows him to get underneath this ball and whip it away over wide long-on"
19.1,"Shami to Pandya, no run","looks for the yorker, doesn't quite nail it. Driven firmly down the ground to long-on, doesn't take the single"
18.6,"Viljoen to Pandya, 1 leg bye","full now, angling in towards off stump. Looks to flick and misses, gets a bit of pad on it - well outside off stump - and it ricochets to the left of the bowler as the batsmen sneak a leg-bye. He fields it in his follow-through and throws at the bowler's end and misses. Hardik would probably have made it anyway"
18.5,"Viljoen to Pandya, no run","slower short ball wide of off. Hardik, who took that premeditated back and across step again, looks to pull and misses, through his swing too early"
18.4,"Viljoen to Pandya, FOUR runs","short, wide, stands up tall and cuts it hard, easily beats third man to his right"
18.3,"Viljoen to Krunal, OUT","short again, this time he digs it in hard and gets it up to shoulder height. Much more difficult for Krunal to control the hook, especially since he had to fetch it from a little outside off. Miscues it, and deep backward square leg takes a straightforward catch running in from the boundary"
18.2,"Viljoen to Krunal, FOUR runs","back of a length on off stump, and it sits up for Krunal to carve away, big follow-through, places it well, to the right of extra-cover"
18.1,"Viljoen to Krunal, FOUR runs","Excellent placement. Short ball rising to stomach height on off stump. Jumps across for a short-arm jab that perfectly bisects deep midwicket and deep backward square leg - he's helped by the fact that both fielders seemed to slow down, letting the other do the dirty work"
17.6,"Tye to Krunal, 1 run","bouncer over middle stump, rises quite steeply, controls the pull well, keeps it on the ground through square leg"
17.6,"Tye to Krunal, 1 wide",slower ball down the leg side. Krunal can't quite put bat to ball as he tries to paddle it fine
17.5,"Tye to Pandya, 1 run","full outside off, uses his wrists to clip it down towards long-on"
17.5,"Tye to Pandya, 1 wide","slower ball wide of off stump - he bowled wider because of Pandya's premeditated shuffle across his stumps. Ends up just outside the tramline, and it's called wide, though he's arguing that the batsman had moved across in advance"
17.4,"Tye to Pandya, 2 runs","takes a big, premeditated step back and across and gets outside off stump. Tye bowls a slower length ball on off stump and he clips it away through midwicket"
17.3,"Tye to Krunal, 1 run","slower bouncer, gets up to chest height over off stump. Pulled along the ground through square leg"
17.2,"Tye to Pandya, 1 run","short outside off, pulled to the left of deep midwicket"
17.1,"Tye to Pollard, OUT","got him! Knuckle ball, long boundaries, and Pollard's attempted big hit skews high in the air off the outside half of the bat, and Mayank Agarwal settles nicely under it right on the edge of the long-off boundary. Would have been a mishit six in a lot of other grounds in the IPL"
16.6,"Viljoen to Pollard, 1 run","length ball, angling in from wide of the crease. Looks to drive down the ground - maybe to long-off - ends up hitting it through mid-on without a lot of power, off the inside half of the bat"
16.5,"Viljoen to Pollard, 2 runs","shortish, angling into the hip, tucked away to the right of deep backward square leg"
16.4,"Viljoen to Pandya, 1 run","in the blockhole on leg stump, looks to whip it away and gets a thick inside edge that rolls into the square leg region"
16.3,"Viljoen to Pandya, FOUR runs","shortish offcutter, only gets up to waist height on off stump, and Pandya pulls it away into the big gap between deep midwicket and deep backward square leg"
16.2,"Viljoen to Pollard, 1 run","another slower ball. Shorter this time, and outside off, hops to ride the bounce and dab into the point region"
16.1,"Viljoen to Pollard, no run","slower ball, back of a length, angling into the body. Looks to work it away but plays too early and gets hit on the thigh pad"
15.6,"Tye to Pandya, 2 runs","in the blockhole, angling in towards off stump, clipped through square leg and the fielder running to his left from deep backward square leg fumbles"
15.5,"Tye to Pandya, no run","slower ball outside off, reaches out to cut and misses"
15.4,"Tye to Pandya, 2 runs","short, gets up to chest height, angling into the batsman's body. Pulled through backward square leg"
15.3,"Tye to Pollard, 1 run","back of a length close to off stump, shuffles across to work it through square leg"
15.2,"Tye to Pandya, 1 run","quicker length ball, goes wider on the crease and angles it into off stump. Driven to long-on, showing the full face"
15.1,"Tye to Pandya, no run","Slower length ball just outside off, presses forward for a push into the covers"
14.6,"Ashwin to Pandya, 1 run","legbreak, flat on leg stump. Gets on the front foot to clip it away through backward square leg"
14.5,"Ashwin to Pandya, FOUR runs","unlucky for the bowler. Extra bounce on the googly as Hardik rocks back to cut, gets a thick outside edge and it flies away to the fine third man boundary"
14.4,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, OUT","another wrong'un, and he uses the big square boundaries to get his man. Pitches outside leg, on a good length, fairly slow, and Yuvraj has to manufacture all the power himself as he looks for the swivelling slog-sweep. Ends up picking out the man at deep backward square leg"
14.3,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, no run","well bowled. Quickish wrong'un angled across to off stump and spinning away further. Yuvraj doesn't quite pick it as he comes forward, trying to open his bat face and steer it square. Slides past the outside edge"
14.2,"Ashwin to Pollard, 1 run","wrong'un pitching on a good length outside off, presses forward to defend and the ball slides into the square-leg region off the inside half of the bat"
14.1,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, 1 run","back of a length, leg-stumpish, swatted away to deep backward square leg"
13.6,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, 1 run","flat, shortish, angling down leg. Yuvraj doesn't quite middle this horizontal-bat swat, ends up rolling gently to short fine leg"
13.6,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, 1 wide","flat length ball wide of off stump, Yuvraj goes for the big drive and misses, wide is signalled"
13.5,"Ashwin to Pollard, 1 run","another carrom ball, just outside off, dabbed towards short third man"
13.4,"Ashwin to Pollard, no run","flat carrom ball on middle and off, stays in the crease and stabs it back to Ashwin, getting opened up slightly in the process"
13.3,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, 1 run","fires this into the pads, clipped to the left of short fine leg"
13.2,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, no run","similar line and length, cut hard into the ground, rolls towards backward point"
13.1,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, no run","flat, back of a length, outside off, chopped towards short third man"
12.6,"Shami to de Kock, OUT","big appeal, that's definitely hitting the stumps, but did it pitch in line? Given, and de Kock has reviewed. De Kock shuffled across his stumps and looked to hoick this one through fine leg, and ended up making no contact. It's on the fuller side of a good length. Where did it pitch? Juuust in line with leg stump, and it's going on to crash into middle and off stumps"
12.5,"Shami to de Kock, SIX runs","shot! That's a slower length ball pitching on off stump and angling away from him. De Kock steps forward and brings his wrists into play to just flick it over the backward square leg boundary, a la Sanath Jayasuriya. Or even the man at the other end"
12.4,"Shami to Yuvraj, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, opens his bat face to steer to third man"
12.3,"Shami to de Kock, 1 run","shortish on off stump, slower one, pulled to deep square leg"
12.2,"Shami to Yuvraj, 1 run","back of a length on middle and leg, looking to cramp Yuvraj for room. Blocked gently into the covers for one"
12.2,"Shami to Yuvraj, 1 wide","slower ball, back of a length, down the leg side. Looks to help it to fine leg but can't make contact"
12.1,"Shami to Yuvraj, no run","quick length ball angling across towards off stump, punched back to the bowler"
11.6,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, 1 run","length ball, another wrong'un, this time headed towards middle stump. Presses forward and dabs it gently, with the turn into the covers"
11.5,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, no run","flatter now, wrong'un spinning from leg to off. Big stretch forward to block"
11.4,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","short, spinning away from off stump, slapped to the left of backward point"
11.3,"Ashwin to de Kock, FOUR runs","another wrong'un, but this is a half-volley pitching on leg stump, and de Kock clears his front leg and heaves it away, up in the air and just out of reach of long-on sprinting at full speed to his left. Brings up his fifty too"
11.2,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, 1 leg bye","wrong'un pitching outside leg. Gets down low to sweep but is a touch late on the shot, ends up getting hit on the front pad"
11.1,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","floated up full on off stump, driven to long-off"
10.6,"Tye to Yuvraj, FOUR runs","whoops, another error in length from Tye. He overpitched one to Yuvraj, now he feeds him a slower ball that ends up as a friendly knee-high full-toss on off stump. Yuvraj punches it stylishly down the ground, between the stumps and the non-striker, and holds his pose, right elbow nice and high"
10.5,"Tye to de Kock, 1 run","slower ball, back of a length, swivels and pulls it round to long leg"
10.4,"Tye to Yuvraj, 1 run","slower length ball on off stump, pushed gently into the covers and they complete a quick single. Risky, but M Ashwin, sprinting in from cover and attempting a pick-up and underarm throw in one motion, can't collect cleanly"
10.3,"Tye to Yuvraj, FOUR runs","shot. That's full, on leg stump, and Yuvraj makes a bit of room to stay leg-side of the ball and loft inside-out over wide mid-off"
10.2,"Tye to de Kock, 1 run","back of a length offcutter, angling across to off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
10.1,"Tye to de Kock, no run","slower length ball, angling across to off stump. Looks to swivel and hoick it away through midwicket, ends up inside-edging into his pads"
9.6,"Shami to de Kock, 1 run",on leg again and it's worked towards square for one
9.5,"Shami to de Kock, 2 runs","nicely struck as it's pitched up on middle and leg, de Kock is looking in really good touch. Flicks it away and long-on goes to his left to save two"
9.4,"Shami to de Kock, SIX runs","just a bit short, not too much, but de Kock pivots on the back foot and hoicks that behind square with a lot of power to send it flying for six!"
9.3,"Shami to Yuvraj, 1 run","hint of room outside off, he dabs it to third man easily"
9.2,"Shami to Yuvraj, no run","no room, right on target on off stump and Yuvaj defends it on off"
9.1,"Shami to de Kock, 1 run","down the leg side, and it's worked to short fine leg. Gayle fumbles a bit and they get one easily"
8.6,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, no run","oh, beats him outside off by a whisker! Yuvraj was struck on the crease as the ball pitched around middle and leg, and was turning away. He showed the full face of the bat but it turned just enough to just miss the outside edge and off stump"
8.5,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","turning away again from off stump, this one keeps a bit low as he cuts it to deep point"
8.4,"Ashwin to de Kock, no run","short outside off, de Kock wants to smash that too but gets a thick inner edge"
8.3,"Ashwin to de Kock, FOUR runs","full on middle this time, de Kock drives it nicely with the turn to bisect the gap between deep midwicket and long-on for four more"
8.2,"Ashwin to de Kock, FOUR runs","way too short, de Kock walks down and then pulls this straight down the ground, the long-on is pretty wide and he smashes it for four"
8.1,"Ashwin to de Kock, no run","googly outside off, decent bounce, and de Kock defends on off, off the back foot"
7.6,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","fullish on middle, flicked to square leg for one"
7.5,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, 1 run","on middle and leg, no turn as Yuvraj works it with the angle to leg"
7.4,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","more towards middle and much shorter, pulled to leg"
7.3,"Ashwin to de Kock, FOUR runs",it was the offbreak from Ashwin but it came in with the arm and de Kock got just enough bat to cut it fine on the off side for four
7.2,"Ashwin to de Kock, no run","more towards middle now, he defends on the leg side"
7.1,"Ashwin to de Kock, no run","almost in the block hole, he digs it out back to the bowler"
6.6,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run",
6.5,"Ashwin to de Kock, no run","KL Rahul thinks he's got an edge and celebrates. No other Kings XI player is appealing, R Ashwin isn't moving. De Kock went for the cut outside off as the ball turned away and looks like he didn't get anything on it"
6.4,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, 1 run","turning in towards the pads, worked away and he's off the mark"
6.3,"Ashwin to Yuvraj, no run","flatter outside off, goes away with the turn far away from the bat, that googly"
6.2,"Ashwin to Yadav, OUT","stays a bit low, Surya misses the ball completely as he tries to pull the short of length ball and he's plumb in front of middle stump. It pitched on off, came in with the angle and trapped him right in front"
6.1,"Ashwin to Yadav, no run","on length on off stump, pushed back to the bowler"
5.6,"Viljoen to Yadav, 3 runs","down the leg side again, worked off the pads square enough to beat short fine leg and there's a close call for the dive at the boundary. Mandeep tried keeping the ball in with his first dive, the ball was still rolling as he went across the rope. He then put in dive from outside the boundary to keep the ball in again. The question if his fingers touched the rope while he pushed the ball in"
5.5,"Viljoen to Yadav, FOUR runs","too full this time, Surya just shows the full face off the bat and drives it down the ground with hardly any follow through. Lovely stroke"
5.4,"Viljoen to Yadav, FOUR runs","slower on middle and leg, Surya goes across a bit and works it to fine leg with some nifty wristwork. There's a misfield at the edge of the circle and he gets four"
5.3,"Viljoen to Yadav, no run","full on the pads, flicked to midwicket"
5.2,"Viljoen to Rohit Sharma, OUT","loud appeal for lbw, the finger goes up late and Rohit is walking! That was slightly full on middle, it had the angle with it and Rohit missed it while targeting the leg side, to be struck on the front pad. There were two sounds but the bat probably hit the pad, and Rohit looks at de Kock but doesn't review it. Was it going down leg, though?"
5.1,"Viljoen to de Kock, 1 run","hint of room outside off, cuts it hard to third man with a bottom edge for one"
4.6,"Tye to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs",short of short fine leg as Rohit pulls the short ball after walking down again. This time the ball beats a diving Chris Gayle and goes for four more
4.5,"Tye to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","comes down the track, looked like he wanted to smash it but he adjusted so nicely to the short of length delivery outside off. He just waited and then cut the ball square with good timing to beat point for four"
4.4,"Tye to de Kock, 1 run","115kmh, he's not giving much pace, as usual, Andrew Tye. Slightly wide of off stump and driven into the covers"
4.3,"Tye to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","looked like a slower one again, this one on the stumps and he pushed it down to mid-on"
4.2,"Tye to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","a slower ball at 112.7kmh pretty wide outside off, Rohit goes after it with a big swing and doesn't quite middle it but gets just enough to beat the fielders chasing it"

3.6,"Viljoen to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","full on the pads, flicked away off the pads by Rohit for two in the gap"
3.5,"Viljoen to de Kock, 1 run","bit fuller outside off and de Kock brings his bat down with hard hands to send it wide of third man. Oh, Rohit almost bumped into de Kock while running and lost his bat in the middle of the pitch"
3.4,"Viljoen to de Kock, no run","angling away from de Kock, he cuts nicely but finds cover point"
3.3,"Viljoen to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","nice and accurate towards off stump, Rohit waits and opens the face of the bat late to help it to third man"
3.2,"Viljoen to de Kock, 1 run","some room outside off with the angle, he runs it down to third man for one"
3.1,"Viljoen to de Kock, 2 runs",short ball to start things and de Kock pulls it nicely for two on the leg side

2.5,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","on length and turning in a bit, dabs it down to long-on"
2.4,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run",outside off now and steered towards point for one
2.3,"Ashwin to de Kock, FOUR runs","just over backward square leg and it goes for four! The length delivery was coming in towards the batsman and he used the angle to sweep it well, and just over a jumping Viljoen"
2.2,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","turning in towards leg stump now, worked down to long-on for one"
2.1,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, no run","stays low and well outside off, Rohit steers it to short third man"
1.6,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","back of length and towards middle, worked off the back foot behind square for one"
1.5,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","look at that drive from Rohit! Gets room to free his arms outside off, and he sends it caressing along the ground with some timing and power for a cracking four"
1.4,"Shami to de Kock, 1 run","nice delivery on the stumps, no room, and he pushes it down to mid-off for a quick single"
1.3,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short ball well outside off this time, Rohit throws his hands at it and sends it to third man after a bounce. That flew quickly!"
1.2,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","short ball from Shami at 139kmh, Rohit hooks and he gets a top-edge to send it over short fine leg for four. Rohit pulls and hooks very well, mind you"
1.1,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","on middle and leg, flicked off the pads and a bit of misfield gets Rohit two"
0.6,"Ashwin to de Kock, FOUR runs","just outside off, de Kock drives with hard hands and gets a thick edge just wide of Gayle at slip to see it race to the third-man boundary"
0.5,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","bit of mix-up as Rohit pushes the ball to cover point, de Kock wants a single and is nearly halfway down the pitch. Rohit called early so de Kock went back in time but they got an overthrow eventually after a direct hit at the non-striker's end"
0.4,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, no run","flatter and quicker towards off stump, Rohit goes back and punches it into the covers"
0.3,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","on middle and leg now, worked off the pads to mid-on and he's off the mark too"

0.1,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",slightly short length outside off and Rohit pushes it into the covers for one
18.6,"Archer to Rashid Khan, SIX runs","whips it over the square leg boundary! Oh what a shot! He hit one like this against KKR last season and repeats it. Step back into the crease, weight transfer towards point as this yorker full ball comes in at middle stump, and he uses the pace to clip it with fast wrists to seal the win with six balls to spare"
18.5,"Archer to Rashid Khan, FOUR runs",shot! Superb thinking under pressure from Rashid. Takes a big step back into the crease and sets up low with a low backlift. Gets a full one at off stump and creams it past extra cover
18.5,"Archer to Rashid Khan, 1 wide",loses his radar! Small margins. Full and slanted down leg side. Rashid sets up for the helicopter again. Misses again
18.4,"Archer to Pathan, 1 run",oh superb bowling. Bowls the yorker at will. Just in the corridor. Gets the front leg out of the way but chops it off the under-edge into the gully region
18.3,"Archer to Rashid Khan, 1 run","misses on the yorker again. Once again only one. Rashid sets up for the helicopter, but this is too quick. Mistimed bunt towards Stokes at long-on"
18.2,"Archer to Pathan, 1 run","just misses on the yorker but Pathan misses out too. Low full toss outside off, scythed to third man's right"
18.1,"Archer to Pathan, no run",yorker right up at off stump. Can't do anything other than drill that back towards mid-off
17.6,"Unadkat to Rashid Khan, 2 runs","short of a length outside off, pulls to deep midwicket's right and comes back for the second. Long boundary there"
17.5,"Unadkat to Pathan, 1 run","slower ball, short outside off. Spanked off the back foot but can't beat Rahane's dive at extra cover"
17.4,"Unadkat to Pathan, 2 runs",falls short of long-on running to his right! Pathan was outfoxed there. Slower ball cutting across him outside off. Looked to slug that but got it off the bottom
17.4,"Unadkat to Pathan, 1 wide","slower bouncer, dug in too short. Doesn't even need to duck at that"
17.3,"Unadkat to Rashid Khan, 1 run","slower ball at a length outside off, drives with the turn away, to sweeper"
17.2,"Unadkat to Rashid Khan, no run","slower ball, dug in back of a length outside off. Past Rashid's attempted cut"

16.6,"Archer to Rashid Khan, no run","full on off stump, mistimed tap back to the bowler"
16.6,"Archer to Rashid Khan, 1 wide","bouncer too short. Rashid is ducking rapidly at this, but it's Buttler with the real work. One handed leap to hold on to that. It was sailing"
16.5,"Archer to Pathan, 1 run","short of a length in the corridor, looks to pull, mistimes completely. Sliced over the umpire but safe"
16.4,"Archer to Pathan, no run","yorker, 151kph, right at off stump. Superb. Yusuf does well to get bat on it"
16.3,"Archer to Pathan, no run","yorker just outside off, looks to run it down, beaten"
16.2,"Archer to Pathan, SIX runs","what is fear, indeed?!  Yusuf Pathan, calm as. Short of a length at off stump, gets nicely behind the line and swipes magnificently to send this flat and over the square leg boundary"
16.1,"Archer to Pathan, 2 runs","yorker length wide outside off, reaches out and jams it to third man's right"
15.6,"Gopal to Pathan, 1 run",what is fear? Yusuf with a big stride down the pitch and an almighty drill down to long-off
15.5,"Gopal to Rashid Khan, 1 run","short of a length and in at leg stump, gets on the back foot and clips this through square leg"
15.4,"Gopal to Pandey, OUT",he's got him! First ball after the break and a celebration that isn't in the same class as the ball he's just bowled. Gopal sends off his state captain. This skids on from outside off. Pandey is stabbing away from the body for the legbreak as he's caught dead in front of off stump
15.3,"Gopal to Shankar, OUT","taken at long-on! Wow. Another wicket here and we might still have a game. Gopal delivers. And he often has for them, without too much of the spotlight. This is a slider, full on middle stump. Shankar wants to pump him over long-on but is done by the extra slide off the surface. Drags it off the inside half to the fielder. But what an innings, it seems he's making a statement every time he comes out on a field these days"
15.2,"Gopal to Pandey, 1 run","length at off, defended to extra cover's left"
15.1,"Gopal to Shankar, 1 run","length outside off, looks to drive through cover, gets it to midwicket off the inside half"

14.5,"Unadkat to Pandey, 1 wide","past the hook but also above the head, deems leg umpire. Bouncer has some steep rise on it but it's in the batsman's favour by the end of it"
14.4,"Unadkat to Williamson, OUT","finds point! Runs down the pitch and loses some shape this time. Cut might have been on again if he stayed in the crease, but he was reaching out after getting down the track. Sliced straight to Tripathi"
14.3,"Unadkat to Williamson, FOUR runs","past point. Poor ball, really. Short, slanted across KW. Quick hands and this whistles past the fielder"
14.2,"Unadkat to Shankar, 1 run","full on off stump, driven uppishly to long-off"
14.1,"Unadkat to Shankar, SIX runs",sweeps him! Slower ball picked up from a length outside off. Gets on one knee and smokes it over the midwicket boundary!
13.6,"Kulkarni to Shankar, 1 run","overpitched outside off, looks to drill it through the off side. Goes too hard. Gets it to long-on along the floor"
13.5,"Kulkarni to Shankar, 2 runs","full on leg stump, clipped between deep square and deep midwicket"
13.4,"Kulkarni to Shankar, SIX runs","clears deep midwicket on the long side! Kulkarni with some poor lengths this over. Short outside off, clears the front leg and wallops this. A proper slog."

13.2,"Kulkarni to Shankar, 1 run","length outside off, opens the face and runs it straight to short third man"
13.1,"Kulkarni to Shankar, SIX runs","backs away and smokes it over long-on! Whew. This was not the player who burst into Ranji cricket with a perfect technique 3-4 years ago. How he has evolved. Short ball at middle stump, makes room and flat-bats it."
12.6,"Unadkat to Williamson, no run","beaten. Short of a length across the corridor, looks to play the late cut, beaten"
12.5,"Unadkat to Shankar, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length just outside off. Opens the face and gets this straight to short third"
12.4,"Unadkat to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length outside off, opens the face and runs this down"
12.3,"Unadkat to Shankar, 1 run","length at middle stump, whipped across the line to deep midwicket"
12.2,"Unadkat to Shankar, 2 runs",just clears mid-off. Cross-seam ball digs into the surface and stops on him as he looks to drive through the line
12.1,"Unadkat to Williamson, 1 run","length at leg stump, flicked to deep square's right off the back foot"
11.6,"Stokes to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball at a length outside off, stabbed into the point region"
11.5,"Stokes to Shankar, 1 run","length on off stump, defended with soft hands into the covers"
11.4,"Stokes to Shankar, FOUR runs",skids away from Unadkat at deep square. Short ball pulled uppishly to deep square's left. One bounce and over the boundary
11.3,"Stokes to Shankar, 2 runs","length outside off, driven on the rise to sweeper cover"
11.2,"Stokes to Williamson, 1 run","length outside off, sliced uppishly towards third man"
11.1,"Stokes to Williamson, FOUR runs","welcome back, KW. The square drive, his best shot by far. Length outside off, he leans in and opens the face late to get this to backward point's left"
10.6,"Gopal to Bairstow, OUT","he's held on! Dhawal Kulkarni makes up, and how! Skips up at long-off and stretches his hands back to hold on! A full ball from Gopal, drilled flat by Bairstow. And after putting down a sitter, he drags this back after it has nearly cleared him. The keeps his shape and lands in front of the rope. Superb"
10.5,"Gopal to Bairstow, no run","length just outside off, punched to extra cover off the back foot"
10.4,"Gopal to Bairstow, no run","length just outside off, mistimed punched to extra cover's right. A diving stop"

10.1,"Gopal to Bairstow, no run","length outside off, defended into the off side"
9.6,"Stokes to Bairstow, 1 run","length outside off, slashed and nearly carries to third-man. He's dropped that. It was dying on him a little, but either way he couldn't hang on and Bairstow retains strike"
9.5,"Stokes to Bairstow, FOUR runs","length outside off, too much width and Baistow continues on his merry way, slashes it away past point again. Poor bowling"
9.4,"Stokes to Warner, OUT","short ball, hurries onto Warner, cramped him for room so he was caught in an awkward tangle, unable to free his arms for the full-fledged pull and that's the breakthrough for the Royals"
9.3,"Stokes to Bairstow, 1 run","length on off, pushed to mid-off and they complete a quick single with the fielder hanging back on the circle"
9.2,"Stokes to Bairstow, FOUR runs","length outside off, Bairstow backs away and slashes it past point for another boundary. That's his area square of the wicket on the off side"

5.6,"Archer to Bairstow, FOUR runs","length outside off, Bairstow backs away and crunches it between point and cover-point to finish the Power-Play in style. Predictable bowling from Archer"

5.4,"Archer to Warner, 1 run","length on middle, Warner swings wildly and gets a thick inside edge towards  squareleg"
5.3,"Archer to Warner, 2 runs","length outside off, backs away and lofts it just over mid-off to bring up his fifty with a couple. That held up in the pitch a little and he was cramped for room but had enough behind it to clear the fielder by inches"
5.2,"Archer to Warner, no run","length on middle, extra bounce but Warner gets on top of it and defends back to the bowler"

19.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Stokes, FOUR runs","thick outside edge over short third and they get 198! An offcutter, short of a length outside off. Stays too far leg side of it and throws his hands again. This time it evades the toe-end and gets just enough to clear the fielder and run away"
19.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Stokes, FOUR runs","ramp again! Length ball pushed across him again. Just a tad shorter than the one he reverse ramped, so he can still fall over into the off side and get this into the leg side. Does exactly that and gets it between keeper and short fine"
19.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, 2 wide","full and down leg side, whips out at it but can't connect. Bairstow doesn't collect cleanly"

19.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR runs","and he gets hundred! Fifty-four balls! What a gorgeous, gorgeous innings. Usually is when this guy stays for a prolonged period. Short of a length outside off and he slaps it off the front foot. Long-on does well to get a hand with his dive to the left, but he only parries it into the boundary"
19.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Stokes, 1 run","length ball wide outside off, chucks his hands at this but gets yet another one off the toe-end. On the bounce to extra cover"
19.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Stokes, FOUR runs",reverse ramp! Stokes with some genius of his own! Gets low too early for the ramp over short fine. Bhuvi follows him with a full one across his body and Stokes quickly swivels to go the other way. Uses the angle and gets it over short third
18.6,"Sandeep to Samson, 2 runs",just clears extra cover. He'll be disappointed not getting better connection on this. Length ball outside off with lots of room to swing through the line. Ended up with a turning bat as he made contact
18.5,"Sandeep to Stokes, 1 run","length ball wide outside off. Looks to carve this over extra cover, gets it to long-on off the toe-end"
18.4,"Sandeep to Samson, 1 run","slower ball at a length wide outside off, mistimed drive to long-off's left"
18.3,"Sandeep to Samson, 2 runs","superb from Warner at long-on to save two. Full toss outside off, punched to his right there but Warner sprints, leaps, slides, gets up in no time and keeps this to two"
18.2,"Sandeep to Samson, SIX runs",gets pumped over square leg! A thigh high full toss on leg stump to Samson. Is there any surprise where this ends up?
18.1,"Sandeep to Stokes, 1 run","low full toss outside off, steps out and gets it to extra cover off the toe end"
17.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR runs"," but it won't matter! Overpitched outside off, stays leg side of it and adjusts his timing to get this well in front of deep backward point. The method is the same: wait, open the face, pick your spot. But the execution is different. And it is perfect. What a sensational over of T20 batting."
17.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR runs","there's more. If there's perfection in batting, we might have seen it in the last five balls. Complete control from Samson. Short of a length legcutter outside off, backs away and slices this between backward point and short third"
17.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, 2 runs","slower ball at a length, expertly nudges with soft hands through midwicket and they pick up an easy two. Masterful from Samson, these last four balls"
17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR runs",and again! Get out of here! Full again and closer to off stump this time. Gets his hands from in to out and blazes it past backward point yet again
17.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR runs","superb! What would you pay for those wrists? Yorker length delivery at the stumps. Gets low and opens the face so very late to get it past backward point. Stunning, stunning."
17.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, SIX runs","launches it over the wide long-off boundary. Lovely flow through the line from Samson. Length outside off and he stands still and deftly goes from down to up, perfectly out of the middle of the bat"
16.6,"Kaul to Stokes, no run","a dot to finish. Superb over. Slower ball, short of a length outside off. Looks to cut, gets an inside edge towards the keeper. Only five off the over"
16.5,"Kaul to Samson, 1 run","full toss outside off, flicked to deep square"
16.4,"Kaul to Samson, 2 runs","dropped! Three fielders under it and if you have your money on the keeper, you've just lost it. Slower ball outside off, Samson wants to whip into the leg side and gets a top edge into the square leg region. Bairstow calls for it, perhaps rightly so, but is just a tad late on it and ends up lunging forward and low as he puts this down facing the midwicket boundary"
16.3,"Kaul to Stokes, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, chopped to third man with the angle"
16.2,"Kaul to Stokes, no run","length on leg stump, punched straight to midwicket"

15.6,"Nadeem to Samson, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punches to sweeper cover on the up"
15.5,"Nadeem to Rahane, OUT",taken at long-on! Rahane's watch has ended. Quality innings by the end. He's beaten by a quality ball though. Nadeem hangs this up at a length on middle. Draws him out of his crease but beats him in flight. Not to the pitch as he looks to loft this and it comes off the inside half and is taken a few yards inside
15.4,"Nadeem to Samson, 1 run","tossed up outside off, met on the full, driven straight to sweeper cover"
15.3,"Nadeem to Samson, FOUR runs",past Bairstow and straight into the boundary behind him. Short and down leg side. Steps across and gently ramps this
15.2,"Nadeem to Rahane, 1 run","length on leg stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
15.1,"Nadeem to Rahane, SIX runs","crunches it over deep extra! That's not an easy shot on a slow pitch against a spinner. Whew, some timing. Full on off, backs away and goes inside-out with great effect"
14.6,"Rashid Khan to Samson, no run","they won't review this caught-behind call down leg. Googly, short of a length on the pads. Looks to glance it. Bairstow holds on down leg side and the appeal is turned down"
14.5,"Rashid Khan to Samson, no run","beaten. Plays for the googly outside off, but this zips away from a length"
14.4,"Rashid Khan to Rahane, 1 run","diving stop at short fine. Length on middle stump, looks to sweep, inside edge"
14.3,"Rashid Khan to Rahane, no run","length at middle stump, leans in, pushes into the leg side with hard hands. Rashid too quick to allow a run"
14.2,"Rashid Khan to Rahane, FOUR runs","hello! Anchor, who? Rahane plonks the front leg across off stump and skies this reverse sweep to comfortably beat short third and backward point. Lovely shot"
14.1,"Rashid Khan to Samson, 1 run","length outside off, leans in for the drive. Not to the pitch and this grips in the surface. Just past the bowler, high to his left"
13.6,"Sandeep to Samson, 1 run","short of a length outside off, uses his wrists to drag this to deep midwicket's right to bring up his fifty."
13.5,"Sandeep to Samson, 2 runs","the bowler can't gather and Rahane completes the second! A century stand with that second, but nearly 99. A glorious cover drive to Rashid's right at sweeper but his throw is low and Sandeep not agile after running back to the stumps"
13.4,"Sandeep to Rahane, 1 run","full slower ball on  middle stump, flicked uppishly to long-on"
13.3,"Sandeep to Rahane, 2 runs","chipped over the bowler. On a length outside off, rising up, but he goes with it. Gets it between long-on and long-off"
13.2,"Sandeep to Rahane, FOUR runs","past extra cover's dive and then beats Rashid's at deep cover, to his right. Williamson the first barrier - doesn't dive because of his wonky shoulder. But a stunning shot from Rahane in the first place: on his toes and regally punched on the rise outside off"

11.5,"Shankar to Samson, FOUR runs","super, super Sanju! Slower ball, tossed up full outside off. He picks it, waits on it, and drills it over extra cover. What hands!"

11.3,"Shankar to Samson, 1 run","full outside off, and once again those jelly wrists of Samson. Whips to long-on's right, only one"

11.1,"Shankar to Rahane, SIX runs","for starters, it goes over the long leg boundary! Overpitched leg stump ball, Rahane leans in and clips it with the pace to deep square's right"
10.6,"Kaul to Rahane, 1 run","length on leg stump, whipped to midwicket on the up"
10.5,"Kaul to Rahane, FOUR runs","well placed! Kaul letting Royals get into this now. Short ball, not quick enough for this pitch. Rahane leaps off the floor and gets this hook to deep square's right"
10.4,"Kaul to Samson, 1 run","short of a length and in at off stump, opens the face, arches into the leg side and runs this down to third man"
10.3,"Kaul to Rahane, 1 run","only a run. Full and wide outside off, jammed out to the sweeper"

10.2,"Kaul to Samson, no run","leading edge safely in front of mid-off. Looks to flick this through midwicket, a length ball on middle, but it's a knuckle ball and he hasn't picked it"
10.1,"Kaul to Samson, FOUR runs","lofts him over mid-off. So casual. That's Samson in full flow. Overpitched on off stump, doesn't even bother getting the front leg out. Waits on it and opens the face late to pick up four easy runs"

9.5,"Nadeem to Rahane, SIX runs","length on middle, down the track comes Rahane and goes straight over the bowler's head with a little more power this time and it clears the ropes"

7.3,"Kaul to Samson, 1 run","length on middle, pushed to long-on"

3.3,"Rashid Khan to Samson, FOUR runs",
3.2,"Rashid Khan to Buttler, OUT","bowled him! Went for the sweep, premeditated, exposed his stumps, and that's a terrible idea against a wicket-to-wicket Rashid Khan, who thrives on batsmen trying to hit him across the line, especially with the new ball that slides on"

19.5,"Malinga to AB, 1 run",yorker on off and de Villiers only manages a thick inside edge to midwicket. They only need to protect six now

18.3,"Bumrah to Grandhomme, OUT","length outside off, another slower ball, de Grandhomme is early into the shot, gets some elevation but no distance, and skies it straight to deep cover. Bumrah pulls it back Mumbai's way, but de Villiers will be on strike"

9.4,"Krunal to AB, 2 runs","launches it over extra cover, but with his weight leaning back, he doesn't quite timing it and that allows long-off the chance to catch up with the ball"

9.2,"Krunal to AB, 1 run",drills a shortish delivery outside off to long-off
9.1,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run",flicks the tossed up delivery on off stump through midwicket
8.6,"Markande to AB, no run","huge appeal for lbw now as AB premeditates a sweep, giving Markande the time he needs to adjust and sneak in the quicker delivery. He hopes its in line with off stump. But at the point where it hits the batsman's pads, it might be just outside"
8.5,"Markande to AB, no run",Rohit is at slip now and he appeals for a catch off the inside edge onto thigh and over to him. But there's no suck luck. AB lives to slog sweep the leggie again. Although he might want to avoid that shot to a ball so full
8.4,"Markande to AB, no run","googly outside off, AB reaches out to it and flicks to midwicket"
8.3,"Markande to Kohli, 1 run",shifts back in his crease to punch a short ball on off stump to long-on
8.2,"Markande to AB, 1 run","looks like a flipper and though it seems to gather pace off the pitch after hitting a fullish length on middle stump, AB is happy to play it off the back foot and flick it through midwicket"
8.1,"Markande to Kohli, 1 run",loops it up outside off and gets it to dip just in time that Kohli's cover drive skews off the inside half of the bat to long-off
7.6,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run",gets forward and drives sweetly to long-off
7.5,"Krunal to AB, 1 run",cuts the back of a length delivery outside off to the sweeper

7.3,"Krunal to AB, 1 run","full and outside off, AB stays beside the ball and drives through the covers"
7.2,"Krunal to AB, no run",chops the shortish delivery angled into off stump towards point
7.1,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run","tosses it up on middle, Kohli drives fluently to long-off"
6.6,"Markande to AB, no run","dropped at first slip! Yuvraj is the fielder. And it's onto him so very quickly. The only hope he is is for it to stick and it just doesn't. A hard-handed, backfoot push from AB - that should tell how fast the edge went to the fielder, that to to his left side, which is usually harder for most fielders at first slip."
6.5,"Markande to Patel, OUT",chops on! Parthiv loves pace on the ball and here there is none. And he discovers that as he backs away and shapes to cut. He's into the shot too early. The googly then deflects off the inside edge and clatters into his sticks.
6.4,"Markande to Kohli, 1 run",picks the googly and flicks it off middle stump to deep midwicket
6.3,"Markande to Patel, 1 run","short and outside off, he backs away and cuts behind point"
6.2,"Markande to Patel, FOUR runs","misfield from Hardik! He's at the long-off boundary, running to his right, he's made it to the ball, but doesn't drag it back as he slides across the turf. Parthiv gets another four, this one with a cover drive to a loopy delivery outside off"
6.1,"Markande to Kohli, 1 run",waits on the back foot to deal with the flatter delivery outside off and cuts it past point diving to his right
5.6,"Krunal to Patel, no run","appeal for lbw as Krunal gets a good length ball to pitch on off stump from round the wicket and turn into the left-hander quite sharply. Parthiv plays all around it, but it would probably have missed leg stump. Time out"
5.5,"Krunal to Patel, no run",on the pads and Parthiv turns it to short fine leg and looks for a single. Nothing doing
5.4,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run",gets forward and nudges the good length ball on leg stump towards midwicket
5.3,"Krunal to Patel, 1 run",flicks the low full toss on leg stump to deep midwicket
5.2,"Krunal to Patel, SIX runs","launches it over deep midwicket! He's got such fast hands against spin, especially through the leg side, and Krunal, by going round the wicket, is feeding that strength."
5.1,"Krunal to Patel, FOUR runs",waits for the tossed up ball from round the wicket to come to him on the base of off stump and then whips it to the left of deep square leg. Lovely stuff. Mumbai don't want runs leaking from both ends and Parthv is giving them monster headaches
4.6,"Pandya to Kohli, FOUR runs","more deliciousness! It's like the ice-cream truck's come early and everyone gets chocolate! Kohli dances down the track, turns a back of a length ball to one that's perfectly in the slot and drives like the boss that he is through the covers"
4.5,"Pandya to Kohli, FOUR runs","gets nice and tall to lash the short and wide delivery to the point boundary. Spectacular batting from the RCB captain. ""Yassss"", he screams as the ball races past the infield"
4.4,"Pandya to Kohli, no run",slices it to point
4.3,"Pandya to Kohli, no run","beats him all ends up! This is the off-pace legcutter, pitching on the in-between length, not full enough to drive or short enough to pull. Kohli looks to flick, playing according to the angle of the ball, but it grips the pitch and darts away to the keeper. Also: it makes Kohli lose his balance. When was the last time that happened?"
4.2,"Pandya to Kohli, no run","lbw appeal, but this will be sliding down leg. Kohli rarely gets lbw even though he does shuffle across his stumps - like he does here. Length ball, pitching outside off, seaming into the right-hander. It's rare that Kohli misses the flick but he survives"
4.1,"Pandya to Patel, 1 run",on a length on leg stump and Parthiv redirects it to deep square leg
3.6,"Bumrah to Kohli, FOUR runs",laces it to the point boundary. Kohli has dominated Bumrah in the IPL. There might be more than 100 runs in this head to head now and this goes right in the top draw. Lunging forward - pace be damned - and opening the face of the bat at the last second to find the gap to the left of Pollard
3.5,"Bumrah to Kohli, FOUR runs",outside edge as Kohli reaches out to a length ball wide outside off with a cover drive. Ends up at the third man boundary
3.4,"Bumrah to Kohli, FOUR runs","whips it to the long-on boundary. Shifts his weight back to the short ball outside off, gets up tall so he can get on top of the ball, and lets his wrists do the rest"
3.3,"Bumrah to Kohli, no run","back of a length and outside off, defends"
3.2,"Bumrah to Patel, OUT","direct hit and Moeen's gone! There's a dive. It's desperate. But it's also very very late. There is no single here. Not when Rohit is lurking at midwicket. But Parthiv turns the slower ball, on a length on middle stump, there and demands the run. It starts with a bit of hesitation and it ends with Moeen miles short of safety"
3.1,"Bumrah to Patel, no run","short and angled across the left-hander, Parthiv works it to midwicket"
2.6,"McClenaghan to Ali, SIX runs","that is amazing! McClenaghan misses the yorker by a few inches and as a result it ends up as a bit of a half-volley on middle stump. Moeen waits in his crease, that bat high in the air, ready to swoop down on the offering, and he flicks it with such ridiculous power that is sails over square leg. All in the wrists! Plenty in the wrists!"
2.5,"McClenaghan to Ali, FOUR runs","top edge over the keeper. It's a ghastly return for a good ball - bouncer, climbing up to his right shoulder, and forcing him to drag it from outside off if he wants to pull. Moeen does and though he miscues it, he still benefits big time"
2.4,"McClenaghan to Patel, 1 run","lovely bowling. McClenaghan is alert to Parthiv's mischief moving across his crease. And to counter it, he takes all the pace off and drags the line wide outside off. In the end, the left-hander can only flick for a single through square leg"
2.3,"McClenaghan to Patel, FOUR runs",short and outside off - the buffet ball in all forms of cricket - and Parthiv wallops it over midwicket
2.2,"McClenaghan to Ali, 1 run",nails the yorker and goes one better by following Moeen's movement outside leg. The batsman is just about able to dig it out to mid-on
2.1,"McClenaghan to Patel, 1 run",walks across his crease and flicks a length ball on off stump to deep square leg
1.6,"Malinga to Patel, 1 run",flicks behind square leg
1.5,"Malinga to Patel, no run","beats him with the offcutter and Parthiv, having judged the length and line - short and outside off - fails to spot the change in pace. As a result, he doesn't adjust his bat swing and is too early on the shot"
1.4,"Malinga to Patel, no run",inswinging yorker! This is genius level bowling from Malinga. And Parthiv just can't do jack. Inside edge onto his boot
1.3,"Malinga to Ali, 1 run","deceives him so royally that Moeen has to do a double-take to see where the ball goes. The mother of all slower balls, hitting on a good length, holding on the pitch and skewing off the bottom of the bat towards square leg as Moeen looks to flick"
1.2,"Malinga to Ali, no run","falls short of mid-off. Moeen looks for the flowing drive through extra cover, but again his timing is all messed up, cause, this time, Malinga gets it to swing into the left-hander"
1.1,"Malinga to Patel, 1 run","offcutter, on a length on leg stump, to start and Parthiv defends it to point"
0.6,"McClenaghan to Patel, 1 run",nudges it down towards mid-on
0.5,"McClenaghan to Patel, no run","back of a length on off stump, defends but he's into the shot too early and gets a leading edge"
0.4,"McClenaghan to Patel, FOUR runs",flicks the length ball on leg stump through midwicket. Serene and simple cricket. It's the game's equivalent to the 2+2 question.Everybody (except Dexter) knows the answer to that
0.3,"McClenaghan to Ali, 1 run",another leading edge as Moeen is done in by a hint of movement off the pitch. McClenaghan hits the deck hard and that helps him generate a little bit of magic. Not enough to get a wicket though as the ball wanders in the air behind point
0.2,"McClenaghan to Ali, no run",gets the shortish ball on middle to straighten enough that Moeen gets a leading edge trying to flick through midwicket.
0.1,"McClenaghan to Patel, 1 run",tucks a shortish delivery off his pads through midwicket
19.6,"Siraj to Pandya, 1 run","full outside off, can't get under it but manages to squirt it away to deep point for one"
19.5,"Siraj to Pandya, SIX runs",misses his length and Hardik picks it up with a wristy flick over deep midwicket
19.4,"Siraj to Pandya, no run","yorker, tailing in, Hardik tries to get under it and whip it away to squareleg but gets a leading edge that lobs up to the off side"
19.4,"Siraj to Pandya, 1 wide","shot ball outside off, Hardik is late on the pull and misses"
19.3,"Siraj to Pandya, SIX runs","That's a gigantic six! Full and in the slot, he goes deep in his crease, gets nicely under it and launches it straight down the ground into the top tier"
19.2,"Siraj to Bumrah, 1 leg bye","full on middle, appeal for lbw as Bumrah is struck on the pad, turned down and they scamper one. It has been reviewed, but slipping way down the leg side, so Hardik's back on strike"
19.1,"Siraj to Markande, OUT","appeal for caught behind and given even as they try and scamper a single length outside off, cut him in half as he tried to steer it to point and thinnest inside edge was taken nice and low by the keeper"
18.6,"Saini to Pandya, no run","full outside off, Hardik looks to tap it away to the off side to retain strike but gets too close to it and ends up pushing it back to the bowler"
18.5,"Saini to Markande, 1 run","full on middle, pushed to long-on"
18.4,"Saini to Pandya, 1 run","yorker outside off, squeezed away past point for one"
18.4,"Saini to Pandya, (no ball) 2 runs","full toss, too high, Hardik has a swing, gets a top edge high up in the air, which had three people converging, before being dropped by the keeper. That's also going to be a free hit"
18.3,"Saini to Pandya, SIX runs","Hardik's turning it on here! Short on off, he rocks back, goes deep in his crease and lifts it over deep midwicket"
18.2,"Saini to Pandya, no run","length outside off, Hardik has a swing but misses it by the proverbial mile"
18.1,"Saini to Pandya, FOUR runs","full toss and he presents a straight bat, holds his shape and hammers it over the bowler's head"
17.6,"Siraj to Markande, no run","full on off, defended towards cover and they decide against the single to allow Hardik to have strike for the next over"
17.5,"Siraj to Pandya, 1 run","length on off, pushed to long-off for an anticlimactic single"
17.4,"Siraj to Pandya, FOUR runs","full on middle, shuffles across and whips it away towards fine-leg for four. Mumbai are continuing to play shots, works on that occasion"
17.3,"Siraj to Markande, 1 run","length outside off, steered to third-man"
17.2,"Siraj to Markande, FOUR runs","length on middle, he shuffles across and tickles it fine for four"
17.1,"Siraj to McClenaghan, OUT","dragged on! length outside off, pretty innocuous delivery, rush of blood and he has an ugly swing at it, only managing an inside edge as it crashes into the stumps"
16.6,"Yadav to McClenaghan, 1 run","length on middle, swivels and pulls it away along the ground to deep squareleg"
16.5,"Yadav to McClenaghan, no run","length on off, tries to steer it to third-man but only manages to chop it back to the keeper"
16.4,"Yadav to McClenaghan, no run","length outside off, steered to point"
16.3,"Yadav to Krunal, OUT","short, hooked and brilliantly judged by Saini at fine-leg! Jumps, takes it calmly over his head and keeps his balance, ensuring that he remains inside the rope and Mumbai are losing their way here"
16.2,"Yadav to Pandya, 1 run","length on middle, hurries on a little again as Hardik closes the face a little early, gets a ;leading edge down to third-man"
16.1,"Yadav to Pandya, no run","length on middle, hurries on to Hardik, defends it back"
15.6,"Chahal to Pollard, OUT","That's Chahal's fourth! Really poor batting from Pollard. It was Chahal's last ball, it was tossed up outside off, would have been a wide had a he left it, instead he takes the bait and tries to go over extra cover, not even usually his area and ends up spooning a catch to the deep fielder"
15.6,"Chahal to Pollard, 1 wide",
15.5,"Chahal to Krunal, 1 run","dropped! Chahal tends to drop return catches. Full on middle, pushed back aerially to Chahal's left, he had to dive, got a hand to it but couldn't hang on"
15.4,"Chahal to Pollard, 1 run","full on the pads, tucked away to deep squareleg"
15.3,"Chahal to Yadav, OUT","tossed up outside off, beautiful bowling, made Suryakumar really reach for it as he tried to go big, it got away from him and he ended up skying a catch to cover, who had to run back a little, but kept his eyes on the ball all the way through before pouching it safely"
15.2,"Chahal to Yadav, 2 runs","full and wide of off, Suryakumar goes for the sweep and top edges it over the short fine-leg for two"
15.1,"Chahal to Pollard, 1 run","flat and quick on middle, pushed to deep midwicket"
14.6,"Grandhomme to Pollard, 1 run","short on middle, Pollard takes a few steps down the wicket and tucks it around the corner towards squareleg for one"
14.5,"Grandhomme to Yadav, 1 run","short on middle, and hammered away towards deep midwicket where the fielder puts in a timely dive to keep it to one"
14.4,"Grandhomme to Yadav, FOUR runs","Doubt if that shot has a name but it's a bit like a ramp and over the keeper for four! It was a slower ball, so he really had to wait after having gone down on one knee, but managed to time it despite the lack of pace"
14.3,"Grandhomme to Yadav, FOUR runs","full outside off, shuffles across, picks his spot and scoops it over short fine-leg"
14.3,"Grandhomme to Yadav, 1 wide","slower ball and down the leg side, called wide"
14.2,"Grandhomme to Pollard, 1 run","full on middle, gets his bat down just in time and pushes it to deep midwicket for one"
14.1,"Grandhomme to Yadav, 1 run","length on middle, slower ball, chipped to deep midwicket"
13.6,"Chahal to Yadav, 1 run","appeal but turned down! Attempted sweep missed by Suryakumar but he may have been struck outside the line, as the ball trickled away down past short fine-leg"
13.5,"Chahal to Pollard, 1 run","quicker one outside off, pushed to long-off"
13.4,"Chahal to Yuvraj, OUT","And Chahal has his revenge with the googly! Full on middle, perhaps held in the surface just a touch as Yuvraj went for the lofted stroke down the ground to make it four in four, only managing to slice it high in the air and straight to long-off"
13.3,"Chahal to Yuvraj, SIX runs","three in three! Yuvraj is turning the clock back here! Another drag down, Yuvraj rocks back and launches it over long-on"
13.2,"Chahal to Yuvraj, SIX runs","Vintage Yuvraj! Full on middle and that beautiful flow of the bat and follow through, goes flat and hard over the bowler's head"
13.1,"Chahal to Yuvraj, SIX runs","short on middle and Yuvraj has torn into Chahal straight away. Perhaps expecting the batsman to come down the wicket, Chahal dragged it down and picked him up over deep squareleg"
12.6,"Ali to Yadav, FOUR runs","Wow, that's brilliant! Effortless from Suryakumar as he punches the ;length on middle through midwicket"
12.5,"Ali to Yadav, SIX runs","length on middle and he connects this time It was quick and flat but equally predictable, he was ready for it, kept his shape and balance and deposited it wide of long-on"
12.4,"Ali to Yuvraj, 1 run","length outside off, punched to long-off"
12.3,"Ali to Yadav, 1 run","length on middle, swung away along the ground to deep midwicket"

12.1,"Ali to Yuvraj, no run","full outside off, pushed to cover"
11.6,"Siraj to Yuvraj, 1 run","full outside off, Yuvraj's slightly late on the drive and ends up slicing it to deep point"
11.5,"Siraj to Yuvraj, no run","full on middle, defended back to the bowler"
11.4,"Siraj to Yadav, 1 run","full and angled in, Suryakumar goes through the line and picks it up flat and hard towards long-on"
11.3,"Siraj to Yadav, no run","length, angling in, Suryakumar misses the flick and is struck on the thigh, done in for pace"
11.2,"Siraj to Yuvraj, 1 run",length on the pads and clipped away crisply to deep squareleg
11.1,"Siraj to Yuvraj, no run","length, angling across, Yuvraj has a tentative poke with his feet rooted to the crease and is beaten comprehensively"
10.6,"Yadav to Yuvraj, 1 run","length, into the body again, Yuvraj fends it awkwardly towards squareleg for one"
10.6,"Yadav to Yuvraj, 1 wide","length, quick at the body, but slips down the leg side"
10.5,"Yadav to Yadav, 1 run","short, hooked and nearly carries to fine-leg! On the bounce though, as Mumbai breathe easy"
10.4,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, OUT","that's against the run of play and the crowd erupts! Clever bowling as Rohit shuffled across off stump, Umesh banged it hard into the surface and further away from Rohit's reach, which meant that he had to drag it across the line, got it high on the bat and spooned a high catch to long-on, who clung on comfortably"
10.3,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, no run","length outside off, makes room and tries to blast it through the off side, can't time it as it trickles away to cover"
10.2,"Yadav to Yadav, 1 run","slower ball on middle, out comes the time honoured Suryakumar flick through the leg side, the lovely flourish but didn't time it well enough. One down to fine-leg"
10.1,"Yadav to Yadav, FOUR runs","short on off, picks up the length so quickly and hammers a pull along the ground and in front of square"
9.6,"Grandhomme to Yadav, 1 run","change of pace, as he hits the deck, but Surya adjusts just in time to send it to long-on"
9.5,"Grandhomme to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","now de Grandhomme tries to hide the ball out of Rohit's reach, but the batsman manages to stretch far enough outside off to clatter it to the sweeper"
9.4,"Grandhomme to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","basically slog sweeps the medium pacer to the square leg boundary and though there are two men out there, he bisects them brilliantly"
9.3,"Grandhomme to Yadav, 1 run",another off-pace short ball and Surya loses his shape as he pulls it to deep midwicket
9.2,"Grandhomme to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","slower short ball, which Rohit deflects to short third man, then looks up to see if his partner wants the single. Surya does and they get it easily enough"
9.1,"Grandhomme to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","pastes it down the ground to long-off, where Hetmyer and de Villiers combine to keep it to two"
8.6,"Chahal to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",flicks the fuller ball on middle through to deep midwicket
8.5,"Chahal to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs",brilliant shot selection. He sees the ball full and drifting into the pads. He knows fine leg is up. And he gets down low to sweep it well to the left of the fielder
8.4,"Chahal to Yadav, 1 run","gets it to drift into middle and leg on a length, Surya works it through midwicket"
8.3,"Chahal to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","flatter, quicker, pitched up and outside off. Rohit drives through the covers"
8.2,"Chahal to Yadav, 1 run",flicks the tossed up delivery on leg stump through midwicket - cause midwicket had gone to fine leg after that last sweep shot
8.1,"Chahal to Yadav, 4 byes",beats him by placing the legbreak outside off in response to Surya premeditating a scoop shot. But the ball keeps low and skitters through the keeper for four
7.6,"Grandhomme to Rohit Sharma, no run","yorker on off stump, he squeezes it out to extra cover"
7.5,"Grandhomme to Yadav, 1 run",flicks the fuller ball on middle and off to long-on
7.4,"Grandhomme to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","the fuller ball seems to stop on Rohit just a touch but he copes with it well enough, keeping his shape and flicking it from off stump through to deep midwicket"
7.3,"Grandhomme to Yadav, 1 run",opens the face and slices the back of a length delivery outside off to the sweeper
7.2,"Grandhomme to Yadav, no run",drags the fuller delivery on off stump to midwicket
7.1,"Grandhomme to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",leans into the on-the-up drive sending the length ball outside off to the sweeper
6.6,"Chahal to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","quick, flat and in line with the stumps, Rohit plays with the turn and flicks to midwicket"
6.5,"Chahal to Rohit Sharma, no run",
6.4,"Chahal to Yadav, 1 run","full and outside off, he drills it to long-on"
6.3,"Chahal to de Kock, OUT","round the legs! This is genius! This is superb game awareness! He's seen the batsman going for funky shots. He's expecting the same again. And he's ready with the counter. A perfectly pitched googly. And de Kock is caught unawares. He tries the reverse sweep again but Chahal bowls it a few yards quicker and a tiny bit flatter. It pitches outside leg, hurries onto the batsman, piggybacks off the inside edge and crashes into his stumps"
6.2,"Chahal to de Kock, 2 runs","shortish and outside off, he cuts through point. Bad bounce makes the fielder look silly"
6.1,"Chahal to de Kock, no run","reverse sweep straight up, but he doesn't connect with the good length ball outside off, skidding on without turning"
5.6,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","launches it over cover. Again it's not perfectly timed but Rohit knows with everyone up inside the circle in front of square on the off side, he doesn't really need to hit them all 100%. That's the timeout."
5.5,"Saini to de Kock, 1 run",short and quick on leg stump and it results in a mistimed pull behind square leg
5.4,"Saini to de Kock, no run","stumps the advancing batsman again, going for his toes this time, and following him as he moves outside leg. This is good stuff from Saini. He's under extreme pressure but he's holding his own"
5.3,"Saini to de Kock, FOUR runs","dropped at midwicket. It's hit so very hard. But it's coming straight to de Grandhomme. He has to get up off his feet, stick his hands above his head, and then hope it sticks. (Hint, it doesn't)"
5.2,"Saini to de Kock, no run","good response. He sees de Kock advancing and bangs it in short, aiming for his right shoulder. The batsman has no option but to duck"
5.1,"Saini to de Kock, no run",steps out and drills the length ball outside off to mid-on
4.6,"Siraj to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","crashes it down the ground. This is brute force. And it's not really a Rohit thing. He relies on timing and the genius of his bat swing. But here, seeing a length ball outside off, he just pulverises it to the long-off boundary"
4.5,"Siraj to Rohit Sharma, no run",glides the shortish delivery outside off to point
4.4,"Siraj to de Kock, 1 run","good work - at least at the start - as Siraj pulls his length back and cramps the left-hander running at him. But then after the defensive push comes straight at him, he misfields and isn't alert enough to stop the quick single (course if he had hit the stumps direct at the non-strikers, de Kock would have been out)"
4.3,"Siraj to de Kock, SIX runs","toooo goooooood! He steps out of his crease again, making just a tiny bit of room so that he can take the length ball and shows it the sights behind long-on."
4.2,"Siraj to de Kock, no run",beats him as de Kock tries to make room to cut a short ball pitching on leg stump and angling away
4.1,"Siraj to de Kock, no run",pulls the back of a length delivery to midwicket
3.6,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, no run",opens the face and slices the back of a length delivery to point
3.5,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, no run","full and angled into off stump, he pushes to mid-off"
3.4,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, no run","full, 149 kph, and outside off, he eases it to cover"
3.3,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","into orbit! The Rohit Sharma front foot pull. And it is breathtaking. Sees the ball just back of a length, so he holds in position after that trigger movement forward and then just lets his lovely, clean bat swing do everything necessary to deposit the ball beyond midwicket"
3.2,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, no run","142kph, blocks a good length ball outside off."
3.1,"Saini to de Kock, 1 run","142kph, full on middle, he turns it to mid-on"
2.6,"Yadav to de Kock, 1 run","shortish on leg stump, he flicks it to midwicket"
2.5,"Yadav to de Kock, FOUR runs","heaves it between midwicket and mid-on! That's a de Kock special, right from his disdainful walk down the pitch against the fast bowler and the fast hands that help him put so much power on the shot"
2.4,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",works the short ball on his hips behind square leg
2.3,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, no run",waits nicely for the full delivery on off stump but the plan to get a single behind point doesn't quite work
2.2,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, no run","extra bounce and so much that Rohit, set up for the back foot punch, has to take his bottom hand off the bat. This pitch has pace!"
2.1,"Yadav to de Kock, 1 run",slices the shortish delivery on off stump to third man
1.6,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs",picks the gap at cover! Rohit is bank when he gets the chance to drive and here Saini floats the ball up well outside the off stump. The Mumbai Indians captain says thank you and also I'm not afraid of you with a giant stride forward and a simple push to the left of AB
1.5,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, no run","149 kph, back of a length and angled into off stump, Rohit keeps to his crease and blocks to point."
1.4,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, no run","fullish, 147kph,  and outside off, Rohit steps forward and lets it go"
1.3,"Saini to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","inside edge! And it's the result of Rohit being unprepared for the pace and movement. Saini hits the deck at 144 kph and gets the ball to dart into the right-hander, who tentatively brings his bat down and is lucky not to chop on"
1.2,"Saini to de Kock, 1 run",whips it off his pads to long leg.
1.1,"Saini to de Kock, no run","clips the half-volley on leg stump straight to midwicket, where Chahal fumbles but recovers quickly enough to prevent the single"
0.6,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, no run","good length on off stump, and at high pace too, Rohit defends now that he doesn't have too much room to work with"
0.5,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs",gorgeous shot! Early signs that this pitch is a beauty. The ball comes onto Rohit's bat and he takes full toll with a flick shot through square leg that is every bit as jaw-dropping as the Mona Lisa (or maybe The Scream)
0.4,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, no run","good length on off stump, defends"
0.3,"Yadav to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs",just like that! He goes full but also way too straight and Rohit just helps it along to the long leg boundary. Easy put-away
0.2,"Yadav to de Kock, 1 run","lovely drive to the left of mid-off, where Siraj puts in the dive and stops a boundary. Umesh will keep pitching the ball up there. That's his strength in the Powerplay. (But good batsmen can turn it into a weakness too)"
0.1,"Yadav to de Kock, no run",pitches it up to see if there's swing. And the ball does curl a degree or two into the left-hander but not so much that he isn't able to drive it firmly to mid-off
19.6,"Chawla to Miller, no run",slaps the short googly to cover. And that's that.
19.5,"Chawla to Miller, 2 runs","googly on off stump, Miller cuts to the sweeper"
19.4,"Chawla to Mandeep, 1 run","that's a seam-up delivery. He's a legspinner who, I think, hasn't bowled a single legbreak today. Drive to long-on"
19.3,"Chawla to Mandeep, FOUR runs",scoops the googly on off stump over Lynn at short fine leg.
19.2,"Chawla to Mandeep, 2 runs","more googlies, Mandeep flicks through midwicket"
19.1,"Chawla to Mandeep, FOUR runs","heaves the googly away to the midwicket boundary, where Uthappa misfields"
18.6,"Ferguson to Miller, no run","slower ball outside off, Miller looks for the cut and his groan can be heard through the stump mic as he misses making connection"
18.5,"Ferguson to Miller, SIX runs",slices it over the backward point boundary. He's backing away to the length ball on leg stump and makes the absolute most of it
18.4,"Ferguson to Miller, 2 runs","slower ball, from round the stumps, on middle and leg, Miller flicks it to deep midwicket. That's fifty to Miller"
18.3,"Ferguson to Mandeep, 1 run","yorker a shade outside off, Mandeep smears it back down the ground and right through the bowler"
18.2,"Ferguson to Mandeep, FOUR runs",stays leg side of the short ball on middle and leg and taps it to the left of point. Good placement again from Mandeep
18.1,"Ferguson to Miller, 1 run","round the wicket yorker on leg stump, Miller's nearly taken off his feet in trying to dig that out"
18.1,"Ferguson to Miller, 1 wide",full and goes down leg. Miller can't quite connect
17.6,"Prasidh to Mandeep, FOUR runs",upper cuts the short ball even though it keeps angling towards him over the keeper. It's actually good bowling trumped even better batting.
17.5,"Prasidh to Miller, 1 run",top-edges the pull shot with the bouncer coming to him a lot quicker than he expects. Lands safely at midwicket
17.4,"Prasidh to Miller, no run",looks to swing the full delivery on leg stump away over deep square leg. Doesn't connect. Missed opportunity
17.3,"Prasidh to Miller, FOUR runs",nails the low full toss down the ground.
17.2,"Prasidh to Mandeep, 1 run","full toss outside off, taps it to cover"
17.1,"Prasidh to Mandeep, no run","short ball outside off and Mandeep, since he's new at the crease, spots the length but not the change of pace and he's into the pull shot too early"
16.6,"Ferguson to Mandeep, 1 run","looks for the pull, but the extra pace from Ferguson, and the height he gets on the bouncer - above shoulder - makes sure the ball goes off the splice to point"
16.5,"Ferguson to Mandeep, 2 runs","full toss outside off, he carves it to the sweeper"
16.4,"Ferguson to Miller, 1 run","slower ball ends up a full toss near waist-high, Miller pulls it down to short fine leg"
16.3,"Ferguson to Miller, FOUR runs","lovely batting! Spots the short ball angled into him, makes a little room, then lets it run off the open face of the bat and places it to the left of short third man. That's all that's needed for a boundary. Even in T20s"
16.2,"Ferguson to Mandeep, 1 run","full and outside off, slices it to deep point"
16.1,"Ferguson to Mandeep, SIX runs",holds his shape and launches the length ball outside to the long-off boundary. Perfect cricket shot.
15.6,"Chawla to Miller, no run","appeal for caught behind and it's given, only Miller's gone for the review. This is another wrong 'un. Pitches outside off and spins even further away. And yet Miller tries to slog it over the leg side. That's why he gets nothing on the ball. And so it's not out. Not a wide either, which is surprising."
15.5,"Chawla to Mandeep, 1 run",nudges a tossed up googly behind square leg
15.4,"Chawla to Miller, 1 run","looks to drag a googly from well outside off over midwicket, but he's trying to do too much there, especially when the ball ends up near the wide line. Inside edge through midwicket"
15.3,"Chawla to Mandeep, 1 run",another one the turns the wrong way from the legspinner. Mandeep flicks it to deep square leg
15.2,"Chawla to Agarwal, OUT","bowls him with the googly. Agarwal does try to hit with the turn, but he's into the shot too early and Chawla, having held the pace off, but kept the revs up, watches it spin through the gate and crash into leg stump"
15.1,"Chawla to Miller, 1 run","lashes the googly, because it's short and spins away outside off, to the sweeper"
14.6,"Kuldeep to Miller, 1 run","good length ball, drifting into middle stump and then turning away from the left-hander. Miller stays deep in his crease and pushes through the covers. That's the timeout. Kings XI need 86 more off 30 balls"
14.5,"Kuldeep to Miller, FOUR runs","hangs deep in his crease and smears the very full delivery outside off to the right of long-off. Russell's down there, moving quickly, diving, trying to flick the ball back, but at the same time, his foot is touching the rope."
14.4,"Kuldeep to Agarwal, 1 run",pushes to long-on
14.3,"Kuldeep to Agarwal, 2 runs","dropped by cover running to his left. It's Rinku Singh subbing for Uthappa. The batsman is deceived as he comes down the track, Kuldeep keeping the ball wide of off stump to deny him the hitting base. The miscue goes out square on the off side and though it's a tough catch, Rinku having to run quite a distance and dive, it should have been taken"
14.2,"Kuldeep to Miller, 1 run",sweeps a tossed up delivery outside off to deep midwicket
14.1,"Kuldeep to Miller, no run",walks across his stumps and is a sitting duck when the good length ball skids into him. Miller ends up forcing himself to block
13.6,"Russell to Agarwal, 2 runs","drills a near yorker down the ground - ha, that's exactly how it feels like when you do it Dre - but there's not enough on the shot to beat long-off running to his right. That part's not quite like Dre"
13.5,"Russell to Agarwal, no run",now his ramp shot's beaten by the slower bouncer (on middle and leg). Dre's toying with his prey
13.4,"Russell to Agarwal, 2 runs",again he flicks the length ball off the stumps to deep square leg
13.3,"Russell to Agarwal, 2 runs","works the fuller deliveyr on middle to the right of long-on. Wants two and gets it. That's his fifty, his first in the IPL since 2015! Pretty good innings but can he find the next gear? (And the next and the next?)"
13.2,"Russell to Agarwal, no run",makes room to try and ramp the short ball on off stump over the keeper. Too quick for such shenanigans
13.1,"Russell to Agarwal, 2 runs","slower ball at the base of off stump, Agarwal practically helicopters it to deep midwicket"
12.6,"Chawla to Miller, 2 runs","pulls the short ball on leg stump away to deep midwicket. Risky second but they get there in the end, helped by a dodgy throw"
12.5,"Chawla to Miller, no run",chops the shortish delivery outside off to cover
12.4,"Chawla to Miller, no run",backs away and cuts the short-pitched googly to cover
12.3,"Chawla to Agarwal, 1 leg bye",works it through midwicket
12.2,"Chawla to Agarwal, SIX runs","picks it up and smears it over square leg! He needs to get down low to meet this quicker, flatter delivery, so in the end he's got his back knee on the ground and short-arm pulling the ball over the boundary. Spectacular!"
12.1,"Chawla to Miller, 1 run",stays back and cuts the googly through point. Seems a touch full for the shot but he pulls it off very well indeed
11.6,"Narine to Agarwal, FOUR runs","late cut. And it's a lovely one. Especially because the ball turns back into the right-hander and nearly ends up over leg stump. Still, Agarwal manages to stay beside it, and deftly let it glide off the open face."
11.5,"Narine to Agarwal, FOUR runs",flat-bats the length ball outside off back down the ground. Big back lift and pure power again.
11.4,"Narine to Miller, 1 run",flicks it through midwicket
11.3,"Narine to Miller, FOUR runs","power-hit to the boundary again, this time with a pull shot, having picked up the length of the ball - short - so early. Some would say he engineered that length with the last shot"
11.2,"Narine to Miller, SIX runs",launches it down the ground. Half-volley from Narine. In the slot for Miller. He winds up and goes big. Straight bat goodness.
11.1,"Narine to Miller, no run","beats him with an offbreak outside off, pitching on a lovely length that can't be driven off the front foot, or cut off the back"
10.6,"Kuldeep to Miller, 1 run","dropped by Ferguson on the long leg boundary! Another slog sweep. And it's pretty well timed too. Just that it's hit too flat and it's almost straight to the fielder. Ferguson times his jump well enough but the ball just pops out of his reverse cup. Then it's almost set to go to the boundary but he has the presence of mind (and agility) to move to his right, dive and stop it in the end"
10.5,"Kuldeep to Miller, SIX runs",booom! Over midwicket and into the silent night! Eden did not like that. A slog sweep of great quality
10.4,"Kuldeep to Miller, no run","nearly drags on! Kuldeep bowling really well against a batsman who doesn't start well against spin. Takes all the pace off. Makes him wait ages and ages. Then, in his anxiety, he goes hard at the cut shot and nearly inside edges onto his stumps"
10.3,"Kuldeep to Agarwal, 1 run",flicks a shortish delivery on off stump away to deep midwicket
10.3,"Kuldeep to Agarwal, 1 wide","googly, which Mayank tries to cut, then bails out of the shot, looking up to see the umpire call it wide outside off"
10.2,"Kuldeep to Miller, 1 run","round the wicket now for a pitched up ball on leg stump, Miller drills it through midwicket"
10.1,"Kuldeep to Miller, no run","loops it up on off stump, Miller goes for a hard-handed push and the ball nearly ends up back in the bowler's hands"
9.6,"Narine to Agarwal, FOUR runs","patted off the pads, beats the despairing fielder at backward square. Useful boundary"
9.5,"Narine to Miller, 1 run","flashed with intent, up and over wide long-on, but the sweeper is in position to limit the damage"
9.4,"Narine to Agarwal, 1 run",just another single   a boundary is desperately needed
9.3,"Narine to Miller, 1 run","down on one knee, swept backward of square"
9.2,"Narine to Miller, no run","wider line, through to the keeper once more"
9.1,"Narine to Miller, no run","big tweaker, past the left-hander's outside edge"
8.6,"Kuldeep to Miller, 1 run",flicked to long on once more. It's slow going for KXI. And that will be a time-out too
8.5,"Kuldeep to Miller, FOUR runs","down on one knee, swept hard through square leg. That's good intent"
8.4,"Kuldeep to Miller, no run",firm-handed block on the front foot
8.3,"Kuldeep to Agarwal, 1 run","on the back foot, tighter line, blotted to the off side"
8.3,"Kuldeep to Agarwal, 1 wide","very wide of off stump, but angled across the batsman"
8.2,"Kuldeep to Miller, 1 run",nudged down to long-off for a single
8.1,"Kuldeep to Agarwal, 1 run","flashed into the off side, and through for the single"
7.6,"Russell to Miller, no run","zips off the deck, into the thigh pad. This innings needs some CPR"
7.5,"Russell to Agarwal, 1 run","fenced into the leg side, off the back foot"
7.4,"Russell to Agarwal, no run","short, and sways inside the line to let this  go"
7.3,"Russell to Khan, OUT","attempted wipe over the leg side, but Karthik simply jogs round behind the stumps and swallows another loose top-edge! Easy pickings for KKR, and they've got themselves a stranglehold now  "
7.2,"Russell to Khan, FOUR runs","opens the face, glided down to the third man fence, using the pace well"
7.1,"Russell to Agarwal, 1 run","tight line, defended on the back foot, to the leg side"
6.6,"Kuldeep to Agarwal, 1 run",cracked firmly along the ground to long-off. A fine introductory over
6.5,"Kuldeep to Khan, 1 run","a quicker slider, out of the front of the hand, and suddenly, KXI are sinking"
6.4,"Kuldeep to Khan, no run","through to the keeper, another wrong'un, taking it away from the right-hander and missing the mow"
6.3,"Kuldeep to Agarwal, 1 run","very wide, and cut to deep point"
6.2,"Kuldeep to Khan, 1 run","attempted wipe across the line, and Kuleep finds the top edge! Flies safe to short third man"
6.1,"Kuldeep to Khan, no run",pushed into the off side again
5.6,"Prasidh to Khan, 1 run",pushed into the gap for another single
5.5,"Prasidh to Agarwal, 1 run","very full, and tapped to the off side"
5.4,"Prasidh to Khan, 1 run","defended on the back foot, and pushed to the off side"
5.3,"Prasidh to Khan, no run","very full, angled into the toes, defended to the leg side"
5.2,"Prasidh to Khan, no run","outside off, through to the keeper on a wide line"
5.1,"Prasidh to Agarwal, 5 runs",angled dab into the off side
4.6,"Russell to Agarwal, 1 run","on the pads, whittled to backward square"
4.5,"Russell to Khan, 1 run",tapped to the off side
4.4,"Russell to Khan, FOUR runs","cor, that's a shot and a half! An inverted jack-in-the-box, squashing himself like a concertina, down into the crease, then ramping the ball off his nose and over the keeper! You need good knees for that stroke!"
4.3,"Russell to Khan, no run","ambitious appeal, raps the pads but on a very full, leg-sided length"
4.2,"Russell to Gayle, OUT","Gayle's gone! Hits the deck hard, Gayle is cramped for room as he top-edges his pull, and Krishna, I think, takes the catch   just   as he and his team-mate at mid-off converge behind the bowler and all but collide!"
4.1,"Russell to Agarwal, 1 run","hint of shape on the back foot, tapped down to third man"
3.6,"Ferguson to Gayle, SIX runs","oof, that's the one he's been waiting for! On the back foot, battered into the stands! It just looked tenderised as it left the blade!"
3.5,"Ferguson to Gayle, FOUR runs","steps back for the smack, and just skims it over Yadav at mid-on! A dirty shanked pull, but it's gone for four  "
3.4,"Ferguson to Gayle, no run","very full once more, speared into the blockhole. Gayle is content to defend. It's ominous when he plays it this way "
3.3,"Ferguson to Gayle, no run","rolls the fingers again, Gayle steps back, deep into his crease to defend. Keeping it solid while he finds his range  "
3.3,"Ferguson to Gayle, 1 wide","fired past the leg stump, very full length"
3.2,"Ferguson to Gayle, no run",beaten for pace   lack of pace. A big wind-up but the ball never reached him
3.1,"Ferguson to Gayle, no run","sharp delivery, hits the seam and jags past the squared-up batsman"
2.6,"Prasidh to Agarwal, FOUR runs","flicked off the pads again, he does time those well! Proper cricket shots in that over!"
2.5,"Prasidh to Agarwal, no run","gives room to the leg side again, but that's a good response from the bowler, rolling his fingers on a slower ball outside off, and Mayank can't reach it"
2.4,"Prasidh to Agarwal, no run","on the back foot, poked to point once more"
2.3,"Prasidh to Agarwal, no run",opens the face this time from deep in the crease but can't create the angle to beat point
2.2,"Prasidh to Agarwal, FOUR runs","clouted over the covers! That's supreme batting, a fraction of room to the leg side, opens up the off, and creams his drive over the ring and away to the rope!"
2.1,"Prasidh to Agarwal, FOUR runs","hops across the crease, pure timing from Mayank, clipping sweetly off the pads and through square leg"
2.1,"Prasidh to Agarwal, 1 wide","takes off down the leg side, lots of pace and bounce, but the wrong line  "
1.6,"Ferguson to Gayle, no run","very wide on the crease again, Gayle squares up on the back foot to defend."
1.5,"Ferguson to Agarwal, 1 run","wide on the crease, dabbed down to third man to get off the mark first ball"
1.4,"Ferguson to Rahul, OUT","a flimsy flap to mid-off! Rahul is through the ball too soon, driving on a full length, the bottom hand comes off the bat, and Yadav makes no mistake."
1.3,"Ferguson to Rahul, no run","width outside off, hitting the deck harder, and Rahul can't connect with a flash of the wrists"
1.2,"Ferguson to Rahul, no run","sharper lift, on the back foot, tucked to the leg side"
1.1,"Ferguson to Rahul, no run","solid line and length, like watching Angus Fraser trundle in during a Benson & Hedges World Series match circa 1990-91. Blocked"
0.6,"Prasidh to Gayle, no run","a round-house swing at thin air! Good lift off the deck. Well then, this is living up to the billing already!"
0.5,"Prasidh to Gayle, FOUR runs","spanged through finer third man! A thick edge, too thin for the fielder, and an unsuspecting cameraman by the dugout wears it on the shoulder!"
0.4,"Prasidh to Gayle, no run","a flat-footed mow, wide of off stump and through to the keeper"
0.3,"Prasidh to Gayle, SIX runs","short, wide, and ramped up and over third man! He looked to be swaying inside the line at first, but just tapped the underside of the ball as it got big on him, and it launched over the fielder!"
0.2,"Prasidh to Gayle, no run","back of a length, cautiously tapped into the cordon"
0.1,"Prasidh to Rahul, 1 run","on the back foot, tucked to the leg side to get off the mark straightaway"
19.6,"Tye to Uthappa, FOUR runs","okay, lets unwrap this. First he moves his back leg outside leg. Then he leaps across his stumps. Then he has to deal with a slower ball and even through all that he somehow keeps his head and dabs it behind point and all the way to the boundary."
19.5,"Tye to Karthik, 1 run","length ball on middle, launches it to long-on"
19.4,"Tye to Russell, OUT","taken at deep midwicket! Right on the edge of the boundary too! Eden rises to its ball-bashing hero. Russell goes for 47 off 17! And this shot too - a front foot pull to a bouncer that came up over his shoulder - is absolutely pummelled, But dragging a ball like that - especially from that height - takes some timing off the shot - even from Russell's shots. Good composure from Agarwal to track the ball, time his jump and take it cleanly"
19.3,"Tye to Uthappa, 1 run","slower bouncer on middle and leg, Uthappa goes for the pull, has to check his shot because of the change in pace, and gets a top edge to fine leg"
19.2,"Tye to Russell, 1 run","takes all the pace off the ball and keeps the line outside off - anticipating the batsman clearing his front leg, which would then mean he'd be off balance if he goes for the slog again. And that's exactly what happens. Great bowling. Mis-hit to long-on"
19.1,"Tye to Uthappa, 1 run","yorker on middle, nudges it to long-on"
18.6,"Shami to Russell, FOUR runs",nails it to the long-off boundary. All along the ground this time. Shami's efforts at finding the blockhole goes just a touch awry. And Russell has room this time - in addition to his tactic of staying so very deep in his crease - to pounce
18.5,"Shami to Russell, SIX runs","another full toss, which Russell swings over midwicket. And would you believe it, Russell has been hitting these balls so hard he's broken his bat. And he's P-I-S-S-E-D!"
18.4,"Shami to Russell, SIX runs",full toss! It's a full toss and that's basically a giant birthday cake for Russell. He yells thank you and digs in with a pull shot over deep midwicket
18.3,"Shami to Russell, SIX runs","launches it over long-off! And it's an unbelievable stroke because Shami has missed the yorker by an inch or two. But Dre, sitting back in his crease, gets under the ball and heaves it away"
18.2,"Shami to Uthappa, 1 run","full toss on middle, drills it to long-off"
18.1,"Shami to Uthappa, 2 runs",finds the yorker outside off and Uthappa slices it to deep point
17.6,"Tye to Russell, SIX runs","pounds it away over deep midwicket! Short ball, but just sitting up to be smashed and Russell never needs second invitation to do that. Brute force that somehow looks poetic"
17.5,"Tye to Russell, FOUR runs","HIIIIIIIIGH AGAIN AND IT'S A BOUNDARY AGAIN! Somebody get Russell's bat and put it through every science experiment ever! He pulls the back of a lengt hball. Mishits it big time. The ball hangs in the air, so long that the keeper himself has time to run back all the way to the fine leg fence, but he can't keep it in"
17.4,"Tye to Russell, FOUR runs","ooooh, it's length. It's length and outside off and Russell clears the front leg and bludgeons it to deep midwicket. B-L-U-D-G-E-O-N!"
17.3,"Tye to Russell, SIX runs","hiiiigh in the air and it's over the boundary. A top-edged six! He's got his eyes off the ball. He's cramped. He's just blindly heaving at a back of a length delivery meant to cramp him on leg stump. And yet even after being deceived like that, his sheer power bails him out"
17.2,"Tye to Uthappa, 1 run",swings a slow short ball away to deep midwicket
17.1,"Tye to Russell, 1 run","another yorker, tailing into the right-hander, almost like reverse swing and even the great Dre Russ ends up looking so clumsy. Nearly falls over as he tries to jam it out and keep it away from his stumps"
16.6,"Shami to Russell, 1 run","heaves it out to deep midwicket, where Tye keeps it inside the ropes, knowing full well he doesn't need to take the catch because it's a free hit ball. All he concentrates on is keeping the ball in play and he does"
16.6,"Shami to Russell, (no ball)","nails him with the sweetest siren of a yorker! It is irresistible. Except for one tiny problem - it's a no-ball for only three fielders being inside the circle. There needs to be at least four. And as a result, Russell, who was bowled neck and crop by a ridiculously cool yorker on middle from round the wicket, gets a florgin free hit now"
16.5,"Shami to Uthappa, 1 run","full toss on the pads, he flicks it to deep square leg"
16.4,"Shami to Uthappa, FOUR runs","whips it to the left of long leg, where the fielder Varun C isn't quick enough to stop the boundary. And so a good ball - a near-yorker on middle - ends up leaking runs. Uthappa batting deep in his crease, expecting the toe-crushers"
16.3,"Shami to Russell, 1 run","nails the blockhole again from round the wicket and even with Dre Russ setting himself up for the slog, he can only get a single to long-on. Great execution under pressure from Shami. This is why he's in with a shout of playing the World Cup for India"
16.2,"Shami to Uthappa, 1 run","excellent bowling: yorker, on middle, he nudges it to square leg"
16.1,"Shami to Russell, 1 run","round the wicket, looking for the yorker, Russell clears his front leg and miscues it to long-on"
15.6,"Viljoen to Uthappa, FOUR runs",flicks it fine and all the way to the boundary to bring up his fifty. That's also the timeout
15.5,"Viljoen to Russell, 1 run","slower ball on middle and off, Russell blocks into the covers - uncharacteristically gently - and sets off"
15.4,"Viljoen to Russell, no run","bouncer! And it's angled into the right-hander, coming up to his head, cramping him up and quick in pace too. Russell goes for the hook and it just goes off the body and over to the keeper"
15.3,"Viljoen to Uthappa, 1 run","full toss, which he hits back at the bowler and gets a deflection to long-off"
15.2,"Viljoen to Uthappa, no run","back of a length and outside off, he slashes and misses"
15.1,"Viljoen to Uthappa, no run",appeal for lbw as Uthappa plays all around a full toss. Luckily there's an inside edge and he made sure to show the ump his bat too. Just in case (which I'm not sure is allowed)
14.6,"Varun to Uthappa, 1 run","drives the slow, tossed up delivery outside off, rather gently through the covers"
14.5,"Varun to Uthappa, no run","shortish and outside off, he slices it to point"
14.4,"Varun to Uthappa, no run","googly again and it's turning big! Someone's told Varun to bowl slow and trust his strength and he's doing just that. With pace off the ball, the batsman isn't able to just blindly hit. Here Uthappa tries to defend and is beaten as the ball breaks into him"
14.3,"Varun to Rana, OUT","taken by long-off running in. He's deceived the batsman again, tossing it up and keeping it slow. Rana plays the line - because the ball is on leg stump - but the ball turns away from him, takes the top edge and is then caught very very well by Agarwal racing forward from the edge of the boundary to almost the 30-yard circle. Quiet relief on Varun's face, and several pats on the back to make him feel better. Good stuff from Kings XI"
14.2,"Varun to Rana, no run","now the orthodox sweep, but with Varun taking the pace off, and getting it to spin away from the left-hander, he beats him again"
14.1,"Varun to Rana, no run",starts with a reverse sweep which Varun spots and fires the ball flat and quick down the off side (which is now the leg side for the switched-up Rana)
13.6,"Viljoen to Uthappa, 2 runs","yorker on middle, he flicks it through to deep midwicket"
13.6,"Viljoen to Uthappa, 1 wide",length ball slithers down leg
13.5,"Viljoen to Uthappa, 2 runs",splendid timing as he gets down low to the off-pace delivery outside off and steers it past point. Could easily have gone to the boundary without Agarwal diving to his left on the boundary
13.4,"Viljoen to Rana, 1 run",slower ball - good thinking against a rampaging batsman on an easy-paced pitch - Rana dabs it at around square leg to pinch a single
13.3,"Viljoen to Rana, FOUR runs","lashes it behind point. This is ball-striking of the highest quality. No premeditation. Superb balance at the crease. And all round the park. Take this shot: it's a length ball outside off, the kind they let go in Test cricket, but he steps forward and plays the most glorious square drive"
13.2,"Viljoen to Rana, SIX runs",outstanding! He picks up the short ball outside off - a short ball that doesn't really bounce - and wallops it over long-on.
13.1,"Viljoen to Rana, FOUR runs",that's fifty in only 28 balls! Gently deflects the back of a length ball on his pads to the unmanned fine leg boundary. His first four of the night  to go with six sixes!
12.6,"Mandeep to Uthappa, no run","looks to slice the shortish delivery outside off through the covers, but misses it altogether"
12.5,"Mandeep to Rana, 1 run",nudges it down the ground to long-on
12.4,"Mandeep to Rana, SIX runs","over cover! That's pure timing. You can slog over the leg side with power. But to hit a six over point, off the front foot, requires a sound base and great hands"
12.3,"Mandeep to Rana, SIX runs",sits up for the slog and Rana shows he's not above such temptation. Takes aim and smashes the short ball outside off over midwicket
12.2,"Mandeep to Uthappa, 1 run","length on middle, he turns it through midwicket"
12.1,"Mandeep to Uthappa, FOUR runs","short, wide, cut behind point. The part-timer, forced to bowl because of Varun's bad day, gets the business"
11.6,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run",flicks the flatter delivery straying into the pads to fine leg. Ashwin's spell is over: 4-0-47-0
11.5,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run",drags a length ball from way outside off to deep midwicket because he premeditates a sweep shot
11.4,"Ashwin to Rana, SIX runs",W-O-W! This is the offbreak and Ashwin tries his hardest to keep it out of reach of Rana outside off. But the left-hander reaches out - while somehow still not losing his shape - and flat-bats it over long-off
11.4,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 wide",the carrom ball goes way too wide outside off
11.3,"Ashwin to Rana, SIX runs",big ole full toss from round the wicket and right in the hitting arc outside off. Rana goes down and slog sweeps it into the crowd behind midwicket
11.2,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","waits a little longer this time, because he's picked the length early, and cuts the short ball on middle behind point"
11.1,"Ashwin to Uthappa, no run","gets the ball to turn away from the right-hander again - except it's a bit short and Uthappa doesn't really make the most of it, cutting it back to the bowler"
10.6,"Viljoen to Uthappa, 1 run",flicks the back of a length ball on middle away to deep square leg.
10.5,"Viljoen to Rana, 1 run","glides the good length ball outside off to the right of point, where Gayle puts in a big, tumbling dive, saves a few runs and gets a few high-fives."
10.4,"Viljoen to Rana, no run","goes round the wicket for another bouncer - and at 138 kph, with the angle cramping him for room and the ball coming up above his shoulder - it's really really tough to hook em away"
10.3,"Viljoen to Rana, no run",goes short and across the left-hander and Rana's attempt to ramp it over third man doesn't quite work
10.2,"Viljoen to Uthappa, 1 leg bye",looks for a flick as the good length ball at 128 kph strays into his pads. Goes straight off them to deep square leg
10.1,"Viljoen to Uthappa, no run",it's the slower ball - but it's also in the blockhole. Uthappa digs out the 122 kph delivery to mid-off
9.6,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","carroms all the way! This one short, which means Uthappa can go back, read the turn off the pitch and tap it to long-on"
9.5,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run","another carrom ball and another full toss, Rana stays inside the line and lashes it through cover point"
9.4,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","looks like a carrom ball on leg stump, he flicks it through midwicket"
9.3,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run","ends up a full toss on leg stump, Rana, rather graciously, dabs it to long-on"
9.2,"Ashwin to Rana, SIX runs",launches it over long-on! He shifts his weight back the moment the ball is short - plus it has loads of room as well - and that means Rana has a free swing
9.1,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","tosses it up on middle, Uthappa knocks it gently to long-on"
8.6,"Tye to Rana, no run","banged in shorter, can't get it away. This is a fine little spell that is just about putting KXI in the box seat"
8.5,"Tye to Uthappa, 1 run","back of a length, dabbed to backward point, good control from Tye"
8.4,"Tye to Rana, 1 run","outside off, another slower ball, and tapped to the covers"
8.3,"Tye to Rana, no run",slower ball   so slow it almost scuttled backwards out of the hand. Rana can't connect as it skids under his bat
8.2,"Tye to Uthappa, 1 run","low full toss, tapped into the gap at long-on"
8.1,"Tye to Uthappa, 2 runs","on the back foot, good length, and dabbed to midwicket"
7.6,"Ashwin to Rana, no run","much wider line, just inside the lines, and Rana misses out on a flat-footed wallop through the covers"
7.5,"Ashwin to Rana, 2 runs",pressed off the back foot to deep cover
7.4,"Ashwin to Rana, SIX runs","hoisted into the stands over long-on! The runs keep coming, as Ashwin strays into the hitting zone and pays the price!"
7.3,"Ashwin to Rana, no run",skidding through on the back foot from round the wicket
7.2,"Ashwin to Rana, 2 runs","slapped out through the leg side, reaching for the ball and just about connecting"
7.1,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","on the back foot, pushed out to cover"
6.6,"Varun to Rana, no run","swished to backward point, not sure he read the spin there, and another useful dot"
6.5,"Varun to Rana, no run","looping onto a good length outside off, and blocked. That'll make him feel better"
6.4,"Varun to Uthappa, 1 run","better this time, bravely offers more air, and eased down the pitch to long-off"
6.3,"Varun to Uthappa, FOUR runs","short and wide again, slapped through backward point again! It's not getting much better for the rookie  "
6.2,"Varun to Uthappa, no run","straining onto the front foot, slapped back down the track, the bowler gathers"
6.1,"Varun to Uthappa, FOUR runs","too wide, chopped backward of the diving point and clean to the rope!"
5.6,"Ashwin to Rana, no run","a swish across the line, half an appeal for lbw but clearly outside the line"
5.5,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","back into the crease, nurdled down to long-on"
5.4,"Ashwin to Uthappa, SIX runs","no messing with this one! Width again, but this time Uthappa was waiting for it, and unfurled a dismissive slog sweep, high over the leg side!"
5.3,"Ashwin to Uthappa, no run","wider line, attempted slap through the covers but can't connect"
5.2,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run","tossed up, round the wicket, nudged to the leg side"
5.1,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run",leaning onto the front foot and flipped to the leg side
4.6,"Tye to Rana, no run","firm defence to complete a very tight over. It's been a mixed bag from KXI so far, but they've settled after that raucous second over"
4.5,"Tye to Uthappa, 1 run",poked to the off side
4.4,"Tye to Uthappa, no run","cutter, on the back foot, tapped to point, no run on offer there. Cunning variety in this over"
4.3,"Tye to Uthappa, no run",swished baseball-style round the corner as Tye slides in a back-of-a-length slower ball. Short fine leg gathers
4.2,"Tye to Rana, 1 run",nipping off the deck and thudding into the splice as Rana defends uppishly off the back foot
4.1,"Tye to Rana, no run","back of a length, popping past the left-hander who doesn't quite pick one of Tye's myriad variations"
3.6,"Viljoen to Uthappa, SIX runs","too much width this time, and Viljoen's over is ruined at the last! A yawning swipe on the up, and clobbered flat over point, and the rope!"
3.5,"Viljoen to Uthappa, no run","pressed into the covers, on the front foot"
3.4,"Viljoen to Uthappa, no run",back of a length again and jagging in late as Uthappa attempts a tentative push
3.3,"Viljoen to Narine, OUT","sliced wildly up in the air, and Viljoen has a debut wicket in his first over!. Rahul called for it early, watched it carefully, swallowed it with a late adjustment. Back of a length and following Narine who was cramped for room on the slog. That's the breathing space KXI needed!"
3.3,"Viljoen to Narine, 1 wide",sliding past the pads
3.2,"Viljoen to Uthappa, 1 run","on the back foot, pressed into the off side. Good line and solid pace"
3.1,"Viljoen to Uthappa, no run","outside off, pushed through to the keeper on a wide line. A precious dot"
2.6,"Shami to Narine, no run","good finish to the bowler, shorter and sharper, zipping through to the keeper from back of a length"
2.5,"Shami to Narine, no run","banged in short, smashed back to the bowler who spills it!"
2.4,"Shami to Lynn, OUT","right underneath it! That's threatening a few satellites as it soars into the Kolkata (k)night   Miller calls for it, braces for impact as it drops to earth like a comet, and falls to the turf to cushion the catch! Great hands"
2.3,"Shami to Lynn, FOUR runs","back of a length, out comes the kitchen sink again! Caught this with the handle of the hot tap, to be fair, but no-one to defend that at long-on!"
2.2,"Shami to Lynn, no run","pushed onto the back foot, that's a good riposte, hitting the splice hard with that strong seam position"
2.1,"Shami to Lynn, FOUR runs",leans back and monstered over the covers! KXI's fine start is a distant memory!
1.6,"Varun to Narine, SIX runs","sliding down the leg side, and launched over backward square! Yeegads, Narine's at it again!"
1.5,"Varun to Narine, SIX runs","that's gone many a mile! Right to the pitch of this one, a hooning slog sweep, high over the leg side! Big pressure now!"
1.4,"Varun to Narine, FOUR runs","honked through midwicket! That's another calculatedly aggressive mow. No need for finesse, just pummel it to the rope!"
1.3,"Varun to Narine, 2 runs",through Varun's fingers! Smashed back down the track and he can't cling on to his left!
1.2,"Varun to Narine, SIX runs","plonked into the dug-out! Plants the front foot, swings through the line, clean over long-off! Old Mystery 1 New Mystery 0"
1.1,"Varun to Lynn, 1 run","looped onto a full length, dabbed cautiously off the legs to midwicket"
0.6,"Shami to Narine, no run","pushed onto the back foot, clipped to leg but no gap there. That's a fine probing over"
0.5,"Shami to Lynn, 1 run","a dirty hoick across the line, under-edged to short fine leg and Lynn is up and running"
0.4,"Shami to Lynn, no run","big appeal as the ball jags back, but might have snagged an inside edge as it thumped into the pads"
0.3,"Shami to Lynn, no run","full and straight, with a perfect upright seam, that's a good solid line at this early stage. Powerfully clonked off the front foot, but staight to short cover"
0.2,"Shami to Lynn, no run","swinging past the pads, we'll have that one again"
0.1,"Shami to Lynn, no run","swinging into the pads, thumps the legs, deflects back into the bowler's followthrough"
19.4,"Rabada to Bravo, FOUR runs","and Bravo finishes stylishly. Shortish, closer to off stump on this occasion. Steps across and then whips it into the gap between square leg and long leg, with front leg up in the air"
19.3,"Rabada to Bravo, no run","and again. Another short, rising ball outside off. Wide enough to cut but too fast and too bouncy for the new man, who still hasn't got a measure of the conditions. He goes hard at it, but can't make contact"
19.2,"Rabada to Bravo, no run","ooh, there's that pace and bounce again. Short outside off, and extra bounce beats the flashing square-cut"
19.1,"Rabada to Jadhav, OUT","a wicket. Back of a length wide of off, extra bounce, and Jadhav gets a thin edge to the keeper as he reaches out to steer to third man"
18.6,"Mishra to Dhoni, no run","flat, back of a length, on leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
18.5,"Mishra to Dhoni, SIX runs","flighted ball, loopy and inviting, on middle and leg, and it's right in Dhoni's arc for the big backlift, for the front leg cleared out of the way, for the big swing and the bigger hit, straight back down the ground and into the sightscreen"
18.4,"Mishra to Jadhav, 1 run","flat and back of a length, on off stump, pulled down to long-on"
18.3,"Mishra to Dhoni, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, Dhoni rocks back, making room, and flat-bats it powerfully, flat but in the air, and it bounces some five yards in front of long-off"
18.2,"Mishra to Jadhav, 1 run","dangled up wide of off stump, Jadhav stretches out for a sweep to long-on"
18.1,"Mishra to Jadhav, no run","googly, spins in towards off stump from back of a length. Hurries onto the bat a bit. Wanted to punch through the covers, ended up hitting it back to the bowler"
17.6,"Paul to Dhoni, 2 runs","back of a length on off stump, and Dhoni jabs it -  without too much weight on the shot, to enable the second run - into the gap between deep extra-cover and long-off"
17.5,"Paul to Dhoni, FOUR runs","shortish, too much width, and Dhoni slaps it away, easily beats deep point to his right"
17.4,"Paul to Dhoni, no run","wide length ball, Dhoni is slow getting on the front foot to drive, and is still on the move when he pushes at it with his hands. Beaten"
17.4,"Paul to Dhoni, 1 wide","slower ball, sixth-stump line, left alone. Was it really that wide, Marais Erasmus? Borderline call - seemed to finish inside the tramline for me"
17.3,"Paul to Jadhav, 1 run","full outside off, strides forward for a drive to deep point"
17.2,"Paul to Dhoni, 1 run","back of a length outside off, jabbed to the left of backward point"
17.1,"Paul to Dhoni, 2 runs","shortish outside off, cuts it to the left of backward point, and Axar makes a good diving stop but concedes overthrows once more with another unnecessary throw, this time to the striker's end with the keeper nowhere near the stumps"
16.6,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, flat-batted down to long-on for a single that Delhi might not mind conceding"
16.5,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run","flat again, fuller this time, close to off stump. Stays back and punches firmly, back to the bowler"
16.4,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run","back of a length, no real turn and therefore no real room. Flat-batted hard to extra-cover"
16.3,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run",down the track again and Axar bowls it flat and quick outside off. Stabbed to cover
16.2,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run",down the track and Axar fires it in at his pads. Clipped to midwicket
16.1,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run","back of a length on off stump, makes room and cuts to point"
15.6,"Rabada to Dhoni, 1 run","short again, gets up to shoulder height over off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
15.5,"Rabada to Dhoni, no run","sharp bouncer, rising steeply towards Dhoni's head. He keeps his eye on it and ducks his head calmly under the ball"
15.4,"Rabada to Jadhav, 1 run","Jadhav makes room for the cut, and Rabada bowls a slower one, back of a length, just outside off. There's no pace onto the bat so he adjusts and plays a flat-bat pull to long-on instead"
15.3,"Rabada to Dhoni, 1 run","back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"
15.2,"Rabada to Jadhav, 1 run","back of a length close to off stump. Lets it come on and defends with soft hands, and the ball rolls backwards into the vast space between the keeper and backward point"
15.1,"Rabada to Dhoni, 1 run","shortish, a bit of width, cut away to the left of deep point"
14.6,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, this time he manages to squeeze the back-foot jab a few yards to the right of cover"
14.5,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run","back of a length, sliding on towards middle stump to cramp Dhoni for room on the back foot. Jabbed to cover"
14.4,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run",nicely bowled. Gets some dip on it as Dhoni reaches out to defend. Goes on with the angle and it rolls into the leg side off the inside edge
14.3,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run","shortish, not enough room to cut. Jabbed to backward point"
14.2,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run","flat length ball outside off, defended to extra-cover"
14.1,"Axar Patel to Jadhav, 1 run","back of a length close to off stump, lets it come and guides it down to the left of short third man"
13.6,"Paul to Jadhav, 1 run","full on off stump, Jadhav hits it along the ground to long-on with a mighty, bottom-handed swipe"
13.6,"Paul to Jadhav, (no ball)","back of a length outside off, dabbed to backward point with an open face"
13.5,"Paul to Jadhav, 2 runs","dropped. Short outside off, Jadhav drags a pull to midwicket, where Dhawan times his jump fairly well and gets both hands to it, over his head, but fails to hold on"
13.4,"Paul to Dhoni, 1 run","back of a length outside off, opens his bat face and stabs towards backward point. No single was available, but Axar concedes an overthrow with a needless throw to the non-striker's end with the bowler still where he ended his follow-through"
13.3,"Paul to Jadhav, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, nice work with the wrists to place that to the right of midwicket"
13.2,"Paul to Jadhav, no run","not short enough to cut on this occasion, goes back and across nonetheless and again ends up chopping it into the turf, towards the keeper"
13.1,"Paul to Jadhav, no run","shortish, angling in from wide of the crease, cramps Jadhav for room as he shapes to cut. Jumps to ride the bounce and chops it down towards the keeper"
12.6,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run","full outside off, Dhoni presses forward for that trademark all-hands jab to extra-cover"
12.5,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, no run","flat length ball, slides on with the angle to beat the inside edge of Dhoni's forward defensive. Sliding down leg, so no real lbw appeal"
12.4,"Axar Patel to Jadhav, 1 run",angles this one into middle and leg and he stretches out for a lap sweep towards long leg
12.3,"Axar Patel to Jadhav, no run","length ball angling into off stump from wide of the crease, defended into the covers"
12.2,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, 1 run","flat length ball on off stump, comes forward to push to the right of backward point for the quick single. Flat throw into the keeper's gloves makes Jadhav hurry, but he makes it well in time"
12.1,"Axar Patel to Dhoni, 2 runs","back of a length outside off, jabbed away to the right of deep point, where Rabada slightly overruns the ball while trying to stop it and fumbles to allow a second"
11.6,"Paul to Dhoni, 1 run","shortish, close to off stump. Lets it come on and eases it to the right of point with a straight bat"
11.5,"Paul to Dhoni, no run","back of a length outside off, jabbed into the point region"
11.4,"Paul to Jadhav, 1 run","back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to long leg"
11.3,"Paul to Jadhav, no run","slower bouncer outside off and Jadhav jumping back and across, is stuck somewhere between pulling and jabbing down in defence as the ball bounces loopily and slowly at him. Ends up not making any kind of contact"
11.2,"Paul to Dhoni, 1 run","length ball angling into leg stump, worked away to deep square leg"
11.1,"Paul to Dhoni, no run","back of a length outside off, nips in a bit and doesn't bounce as high as expected. Looks to cut and gets a thick inside edge past (but not too close to) his off stump"
10.6,"Mishra to Dhoni, 1 run","flat, back of a length, on off stump. Flat-batted down to long-on"
10.5,"Mishra to Jadhav, 1 run","ooh, lovely flight and dip. Comes forward to defend and the ball drops shorter than anticipated and doesn't turn. Inside edge rolls off the pad towards short fine leg"
10.4,"Mishra to Dhoni, 1 leg bye","full, angling into leg stump, clipped to the right of square leg"
10.3,"Mishra to Dhoni, FOUR runs","googly, shortish and wide, extra bounce, and Dhoni, rocking back to cut, gets a thick outside edge that flies high to the right of slip"
10.2,"Mishra to Raina, OUT","another wrong'un, a big appeal, and it's given. Raina walks too. May have been the front-of-the-hand slider - just kept going with the angle from over the wicket while Raina went back to play the late dab. Ended up sliding off the bat face into Rishabh Pant's gloves"
10.1,"Mishra to Jadhav, 1 run",wrong'un sliding in towards off stump. Gets forward and flicks it round the corner to long leg
9.6,"Tewatia to Jadhav, 1 run","top edge but slip cant quite run that far (meaning short fine leg). Jadhav goes for the sweep, completely mistimes it, but still survives"
9.5,"Tewatia to Jadhav, no run",nudges to midwicket
9.4,"Tewatia to Jadhav, FOUR runs","beautiful hands! He's actually not quite in position for the late cut, seeing as he is on the front foot, but he just shifts his weight back, waits for the legspin to happen, and then karate chops the bat down on top of the ball"
9.3,"Tewatia to Jadhav, no run",shapes to come down the pitch but the trajectory is too flat and so he just gets forward to block outside off
9.2,"Tewatia to Raina, 1 run",taps it down towards long-on for the single
9.1,"Tewatia to Raina, SIX runs",launches it over midwicket. So so so far over. It's a length ball outside off and Raina races out of his crease to slog it with a vengeance
8.6,"Mishra to Jadhav, no run","good length on off stump, Jadhav eases forward to defend"
8.5,"Mishra to Raina, 1 run","the ball dips on him, denying him the slog sweep that looks so on when the ball was first delivered, lobbing up over his eyeline on middle stump"
8.4,"Mishra to Jadhav, 1 run",keeps back to the very full delivery on middle stump and quite easily flicks it behind square leg
8.3,"Mishra to Raina, 1 run",spots that the good length ball is angled across him and so he lets it pass behind him and dabs it to the left of short third man
8.2,"Mishra to Jadhav, 1 run","spots the short ball outside off, waits for it to turn and then smashes it through cover"
8.1,"Mishra to Jadhav, no run","full on off stump, defends"
7.6,"Tewatia to Jadhav, 1 run","tosses it up and gets it to drift in on off stump, Jadhav gets forward, to the pitch of the ball, and deftly turns it behind square leg"
7.5,"Tewatia to Raina, 1 run","goes back, waits for the way the ball will turn, in the end it actually doesn't, so he's able to get on top of it and knock it down to long-on"
7.4,"Tewatia to Jadhav, 1 run",nudges a full delivery on middle to midwicket
7.3,"Tewatia to Jadhav, no run","pushes it through nice and full on middle, Jadhav though is comfortable playing this too off the back foot"
7.2,"Tewatia to Jadhav, FOUR runs",too short. Too much room. Too good a pull shot to be anything but a boundary at midwicket
7.1,"Tewatia to Raina, 1 run","goes for the flighted googly outside off from round the stumps, Raina looks to turn it through midwicket, gets a leading edge down the ground"
6.6,"Mishra to Jadhav, no run","huge appeal for lbw but umpire Menon says no. For half a second, it looked close, with the ball beating Jadhav for pace as he plays around his front pad. Perhaps it is just sliding down leg"
6.5,"Mishra to Jadhav, no run","flatter delivery outside off, Jadhav goes back and blocks it"
6.5,"Mishra to Watson, 1 wide, OUT",huge appeal for a stumping. And it all starts with some sexy bowling from Mishy. Tosses it up. Tempting the batsman. Luring him into a big shot over the covers. Bringing him out of his crease and then making him lose his shape thanks to the amount of turn off the pitch. Now all that's left is for Pant to collect the ball and break the stumps and he does it in style
6.4,"Mishra to Watson, SIX runs",heaves it over deep midwicket! Too short. Too straight. Too easy. Big pull. Watson in all his glory. And a man in the crowd takes the catch and keeps it. Now he has to deal with a policeman demanding it back
6.3,"Mishra to Watson, no run","fires it through flat and quick on off stump, defends it"
6.2,"Mishra to Watson, SIX runs",launches it down the ground! That - for once - is beautiful use of the feet. Watson does'n't leave his crease until the ball is out of Mishra's hands - at which point the bowler has just stand and watch his length ball be turned into a half-volley and thumped down the ground
6.1,"Mishra to Watson, 2 runs",sees the full ball drifting into the pads and so he goes down low to sweep the ball to fine leg
5.6,"Rabada to Watson, 1 run",gets of his toes to deal with a short ball angled into him at 150.9kph. Neat little flick through square leg
5.5,"Rabada to Watson, no run","full on leg stump, defends"
5.4,"Rabada to Raina, 1 run",slower ball on the pads - he's gone round the stumps as well - Raina turns it through square leg
5.3,"Rabada to Raina, no run","good length and outside off, pushes to mid-off"
5.2,"Rabada to Raina, FOUR runs","shuffles inside the line of the ball again, and helps it over square leg. Short on leg stump and with his premeditated movements, he's always going to pull that shot off"
5.1,"Rabada to Watson, 1 run","back of a length on leg stump at 145 kph, Watson ticks it to midwicket"
4.6,"Sharma to Raina, FOUR runs",now the slog! This over is Raina's limited-overs game in a nut shell. Looking awkward. Then looking stunning. Then making the bowler tear his hair out. And Ishant has plenty of that. Bowls a short ball outside off and gets pulled straight of midwicket
4.5,"Sharma to Raina, FOUR runs",that's vintage!! Raina in his prime used to cut fast bowlers just like this. Clearing the front leg and lashing it over point. Devil-may care
4.4,"Sharma to Raina, FOUR runs",it's like bowling to a revolving door! Raina moves across his stumps. He knows it is going to be short. He knows it will be outside off. He just holds the bat horizontally at the point where the ball will probably come and then turns his whole body to his right to pull it - Ganguly style - to the square leg boundary
4.3,"Sharma to Watson, 1 run","slower ball, back of a length, on leg stump, Watson picks all of that up and gently tucks it to square leg"
4.2,"Sharma to Raina, 1 run","comes down the pitch, then looks totally awkward because Ishant once again bowls it short and cramps the batsman. Raina pulls but it's a mis-hit down the ground."
4.1,"Sharma to Raina, 4 leg byes",leaps across his stumps and basically tickles a short ball on leg stump away to the fine leg boundary. With his thigh pad though. No bat
3.6,"Rabada to Watson, SIX runs","top-edge and the 145 kph bouncer goes into orbit behind the wicketkeeper. Watson's not the kind to shy away from a fast bowler. No matter how ugly it makes him look. We knew that from 2015. And here too he gets lucky, the pull shot mis-hit but going for six"
3.5,"Rabada to Watson, FOUR runs","goes for the yorker, but this time the angle he's hoping to create into the right-hander is a little too acute and Watson flicks it to the fine leg boundary. At 150 kph, it flies"
3.4,"Rabada to Watson, no run","148 kph, takes a hit! This is a short ball following Watson, pitching on off stump and cutting into him nastily. Watson has no time to deal with it. Ends up fending at the ball, which somehow sneaks away towards the covers"
3.3,"Rabada to Watson, no run",searing yorker on middle - at 148 kph - but Watson is good enough to keep it out. Solid concentration!
3.2,"Rabada to Watson, no run",
3.1,"Rabada to Watson, no run",146 kph and fierce! Watson is pinned in his crease as he defends a fuller delivery on off stump
2.6,"Sharma to Watson, 1 run",nudges a fuller delivery on middle through midwicket
2.5,"Sharma to Raina, 1 run",goes full and straight - like really full and straight - but Raina is able to dink it to mid-off
2.4,"Sharma to Rayudu, OUT","taken at mid-off! Rayudu pays for being a little too enthusiastic. He hares down the pitch too early, allowing the bowler the chance to change his length, hit the deck hard, cramp the batsman, and even startle him for pace because hey, he chose to needlessly run down the pitch, reducing the time he gets to face the ball. It comes off the top of the bat and balloons to Iyer"
2.3,"Sharma to Watson, 1 run","inside edge as Watson defends a good length ball on off stump, but Rayudu pulls his partner through for a quick single and makes it despite a direct hit from Ishant, who ran the length of the pitch and underarmed it on target"
2.2,"Sharma to Watson, FOUR runs","beautifully done! Watson does nothing more than keep his shape, wait for the full delivery to come to him, and then unleashes a whirl of his wrists that sends the ball over midwicket. Outstanding T20 batting"
2.1,"Sharma to Watson, no run","looks for the pull, but the back of a length ball comes onto him just a smidge quicker than he expects and it comes off the splice and wanders to cover"
1.6,"Axar Patel to Rayudu, no run","good end to the over, keeping it wicket to wicket and pushing the batsman back with his length. Rayudu punches it to mid-on"
1.5,"Axar Patel to Watson, 1 run",eases the ball to mid-on and then sprints through
1.4,"Axar Patel to Watson, no run",beats him with a tossed up ball outside off and Watson doesn't quite nail it with his sweep shot
1.3,"Axar Patel to Watson, FOUR runs",too short and on this pitch it sits up to be smacked. Especially with the line on leg stump. All Watson has to do is bring his full power down on the ball and the pull shot whistles away
1.2,"Axar Patel to Watson, no run","backs away again to a good length ball outside off but since it stops on the pitch, Watson has to check his shot and play with a straight bat to cover"
1.1,"Axar Patel to Watson, FOUR runs","course if it's short like that, he can rock back, make room and cut the ball a shade outside off through the covers. Violent. Beautiful"
0.6,"Sharma to Watson, 1 run","good length on off stump, Watson bends his knees, staying low to deal with the ball and slice it to point"
0.5,"Sharma to Rayudu, 1 run","dropped at slip Dhawan is standing a bit wide there, diving low to his left, gets one hand to it but the ball bursts through. Good stuff again from Ishant, bowling it short and bringing the natural variation from the pitch into play. In this case, it was some seam movement away from the batsman who tries to defend"
0.4,"Sharma to Rayudu, no run",hit the deck though and you bring in uncertainty. The ball might stop on the batsman. Ishant tries his best with that ploy and keeps Rayudu to a block
0.3,"Sharma to Rayudu, FOUR runs",laces it through the covers. Flowing drive from Rayudu and he finds the gap to the left of the fielder up inside the circle. The new ball is a source of runs on this pitch. Especially when the bowler errs full.
0.2,"Sharma to Watson, 1 run","but the moment there's width, Watson's brutal. Carves the short ball away to the right of deep third man"
0.1,"Sharma to Watson, no run","lovely start. Angles the full length delivery into Watson, denying him any room and the batsman has no other choice but to defend"
19.6,"Bravo to Tewatia, 1 run","slower length ball on off stump, gets down on one knee to sweep to deep square leg"
19.5,"Bravo to Tewatia, no run","again he steps across, looking for that fine leg area, but this one's at a difficult place to hit, a full, dipping slower ball outside off,  and he swings too early through his attempted sweep and misses"
19.4,"Bravo to Axar Patel, 1 run","full outside off, fast hands through the ball to carve it away, in the air and on the bounce, to third man. May not have wanted to slice it so fine"
19.3,"Bravo to Tewatia, 1 run","short on off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
19.2,"Bravo to Tewatia, FOUR runs","and again, that big step across the stumps. This time it's Tewatia, and he helps a loopy full-toss - aimed at the top of off stump - to the left of the diving Watson at short fine leg"
19.1,"Bravo to Tewatia, 2 runs","slower ball, back of a length, on off stump, flat-batted down the ground, past the stumps and to the right of long-on"
18.6,"Thakur to Axar Patel, FOUR runs","shot. He knew fine leg was up in the circle, and took a step across his stumps anticipating the middle-stump ball, short of a good length, from Thakur. Would have been a good line otherwise, with deep backward square leg in place for the flick or pull, but getting across the stumps allows him to scoop this over short fine leg"
18.5,"Thakur to Tewatia, 1 run","shortish, angling down leg, pulled round to deep backward square leg"
18.4,"Thakur to Axar Patel, 1 leg bye","well bowled, short and angling into the front shoulder from wide of the crease. Too early into his pull and he's hit on the body"
18.3,"Thakur to Tewatia, 1 run","slower length ball outside off, flat-batted through extra-cover, no timing at all"
18.2,"Thakur to Axar Patel, 1 run","back of a length on middle stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
18.1,"Thakur to Axar Patel, no run","short of a length, angling in towards off stump. Looks for the front-foot swipe to long-on, only manages a thick inside edge into his front pad"
17.6,"Bravo to Axar Patel, 1 run","length ball on off stump, makes a bit of room and carves it to backward point"
17.5,"Bravo to Tewatia, 1 run","short, chest-high ball on off stump, pulled to deep midwicket"
17.4,"Bravo to Tewatia, no run","length ball wide of off, not full enough for the cover drive when the offcutter grips and turns like that. Beats the outside edge again"
17.3,"Bravo to Axar Patel, 1 run","fuller, angling into the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
17.2,"Bravo to Axar Patel, no run","full-pace delivery, back of a length and outside off. Zips past the edge as Axar looks to dab to third man"
17.1,"Bravo to S Dhawan, OUT","and Bravo continues to pick up wickets. Slower length ball on off stump and Dhawan can't get any power on it as he looks for the pick-up whip. Too early on the shot too, and he sends it ballooning up for a second catch to Thakur, running in from deep square leg"
16.6,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run","fuller, on off stump, swept with the turn down to long leg"
16.5,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 2 runs","shortish outside off, drags a pull to the left of deep midwicket. That brings up his fifty, off 45 balls."
16.4,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, 1 run","tossed up on off stump, driven quietly to long-on"
16.3,"Jadeja to Paul, OUT","bowled 'im! What a follow-up to the previous ball. That one took ages reaching Paul, this one is past his outside edge before he can bring his bat down fully. Flat, back of a length, spun hard out of the hand and straightening wickedly after angling in from a round-arm release. Tries to make room initially, then tries to bring his bat down straight in a hurry, and ends up playing a long way inside the line"
16.2,"Jadeja to Paul, no run",makes room to cut but the ball just doesn't come on. Drags it back to the bowler off the inside half of the bat
16.1,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run","down the track, swipes the full one from outside off stump to long-on, all along the ground"
15.6,"Bravo to Paul, no run","slower short ball outside off, swings too early and misses the pull"
15.5,"Bravo to Paul, no run","big appeal, not given. Back of a length offcutter, and Paul shuffles across to try and work into the leg side. Nips in past the inside edge, but it might be a touch high, and the impact may have been outside off"
15.4,"Bravo to Ingram, OUT","length ball on middle stump, and for the second time in the over an innocuous delivery picks up a wicket. Stays leg-side of the ball and goes for the on-the-up drive, but ends up hitting it straight into the lap of the cover fielder"
15.3,"Bravo to Ingram, 2 runs","fullish slower one on leg stump, clipped down to long-on"
15.2,"Bravo to Pant, OUT","length ball angling into off stump, and Bravo has taken out the dangerman. Wasn't so much the ball that did it. Pant whips away a good-looking pick-up shot, times it really well, but ends up hitting it within the range of Thakur at deep square leg. Thakur had to do quite a bit of work to sprint to his right and then complete the catch on the slide"
15.2,"Bravo to Pant, 1 wide","slower one, fullish, ends up angling it a long way down the leg side"
15.1,"Bravo to S Dhawan, 1 run","short, angling into leg stump, pulled to deep backward square leg"
14.6,"Harbhajan to Pant, SIX runs","what a shot that is! Harbhajan has kept Pant quiet with this tactic of bowling it flat and hard into the pitch, and making him reach for the ball. On this occasion the line is closer to off stump, and he leans back and flat-bats it over long-off's head. Incredible. He didn't have much room there to free his arms, but he still managed to muscle it all the way"
14.5,"Harbhajan to Pant, no run","flat, back of a length, again on that wide-ish line. Slapped to extra-cover"
14.5,"Harbhajan to Pant, 1 wide","and again, a quick one speared into a shortish length wide of off stump. Reaches out to try and lash it through the covers, and it turns away sharply and beats him by a long way"
14.4,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run","full now, closer to off stump, punched firmly to long-off"
14.3,"Harbhajan to Pant, 1 run","a bit more of the old Harbhajan loop on this occasion, but still a touch short outside off. Slapped to sweeper cover"
14.2,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run","drags down an extremely short ball, flat, into the middle of the pitch and turns away wide of off stump. Reaches out and flat-bats down the ground to long-on"
14.1,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, no run","flat length ball fairly wide of off, slapped to deep point"
13.6,"Bravo to S Dhawan, 1 run","back of a length on middle stump, swivels to play a short-arm jab along the ground to deep square leg"
13.5,"Bravo to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","gorgeous timing. Low full-toss angling into off stump, and he just shows it the full face and sends the ball racing between the bowler and the non-striker"
13.4,"Bravo to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","slower ball, back of a length, close to off stump, and that's nicely done by Dhawan, jumps away from the line to make room and then he brings his bat down like an axe, strong wrists, to slash it away to the right of the sweeper on the point boundary"
13.3,"Bravo to Pant, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, whip-pulled away to the left of deep midwicket"
13.2,"Bravo to Pant, 2 runs","back of a length close to off stump, nice use of the hands to manipulate his bat face and tuck it away through square leg"
13.2,"Bravo to Pant, 1 wide","quicker ball this time, angling in sharply to try and cramp Pant for room. Ends up angling it down leg"
13.1,"Bravo to Pant, FOUR runs","length ball angling into a fourth-stump line, and it's the offcutter, so it straightens a touch as Pant looks to punch towards mid-off. Thick edge runs away past Dhoni diving to his left"
12.6,"Jadeja to Pant, 1 run","back of a length outside off, whipped with the turn to deep midwicket"
12.5,"Jadeja to Pant, 2 runs","length ball close to off stump, gets on the front foot and works it away gently through midwicket. No one in the circle in front of square on the leg side, and he chances a second run despite Rayudu closing down quickly from deep midwicket"
12.4,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run","back of a length, and now he looks to cramp him with a middle-and-leg line. Stays leg-side of the ball and chops it down to short third man"
12.3,"Jadeja to Pant, 1 run","fires it in flatter now, and fairly short outside off, chopped to backward point"
12.2,"Jadeja to Pant, FOUR runs","goes full now, outside off, and Pant goes on the back foot to shorten the length slightly and free his arms to play a flat-bat drive to the right of cover. Excellent shot"
12.1,"Jadeja to Pant, 2 runs","drops a little short and offers a bit of width, Pant slaps it away to the left of deep point"
11.6,"Tahir to S Dhawan, no run","full on off stump, almost in the blockhole. Dhawan looks to jab it down the ground towards long-off but Tahir moves quickly and cuts it off"
11.5,"Tahir to Pant, 1 run","back of a length, angling across and straightening slightly towards off stump, gets on the back foot to work it away through square leg"
11.4,"Tahir to Iyer, OUT","big appeal, and it's given! Does Iyer for length here - wasn't short enough to cut and he was going back, playing the trajectory rather than the length. Then it skids on straight instead of turning away, and by the time Iyer can bring his bat down it's already zipped through and struck his back pad. Looked pretty plumb on first glance"
11.3,"Tahir to S Dhawan, 1 run",the line is straighter now and he clips it gently through midwicket
11.2,"Tahir to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",fullish outside off and Dhawan sweeps fiercely to the midwicket boundary
11.1,"Tahir to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","bam. Down the track and Tahir sees him coming, floats a googly wide of off stump and makes him reach for it. Dhawan reaches out and flat-bats powerfully back down the ground, between the bowler and the non-striker"
10.6,"Jadeja to Iyer, no run","how'd that miss! Angled in, flat, from wide of the crease, and it straightens past the outside edge as Iyer reaches out for a push into the off side. So close to off stump"
10.5,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run","full on off stump, clipped to long-on"
10.4,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run","flat length ball angling into off stump, goes back and nudges gently towards midwicket"
10.3,"Jadeja to Iyer, 2 runs","a touch shorter, on leg stump again, goes back to work it through square leg"
10.2,"Jadeja to Iyer, no run","fired in flat on leg stump, defended back down the pitch, keeping the front pad out of the way"
10.1,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye","flat length ball wide of off stump, stretches across to sweep, misses, gets a bit of pad on it down to the fine third man region"
9.6,"Tahir to S Dhawan, 1 run","down the track, Tahir floats it a little wider outside off. Driven to long-off"
9.5,"Tahir to S Dhawan, no run","well bowled, wrong'un. Pitches on about middle stump and beats Dhawan's attempted sweep"
9.4,"Tahir to Iyer, 1 run","flight again, but it's pitched right up and at the batsman's feet. Clipped through forward square leg"
9.3,"Tahir to Iyer, SIX runs","a bit of flight outside off, and that's walloped. Clears his front leg and swings through the line to launch it high and straight, back over the bowler's head"
9.2,"Tahir to S Dhawan, 1 run","back of a length on the pads, tucked away to deep backward square leg"
9.1,"Tahir to Iyer, 1 run","flat skidder on middle and leg, clipped towards backward square leg"
8.6,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, no run",defended back to the bowler
8.5,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, no run","bowls it quick and flat, but once it hits the deck, some of the pace comes off and Dhawan ends up being too early on the reverse sweep"
8.4,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run",eases it through point
8.3,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run",comes down the pitch and is reduced to slogging because Jadeja pulls his length back and keeps the ball wide of Dhawan's reach outside off. Mis-hit through square leg
8.2,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run",slices it to point and sprints across for a quick single. Jadeja knocks the bails off even as the point fielder throws so there's no real danger
8.1,"Jadeja to Iyer, no run","quicker than lightning, the Dhoni stumping. Will Shreyas survive? Think he will. But phew. This ball - the turn on it! Pitches on middle stump and rags away into Dhoni's gloves. And he's waiting behind those stumps. Ready to pounce. The wolf in yellow clothing. Just that this time Shreyas has the presence of mind to keep his back foot behind the crease and grounded even though he's totally deceived by the flight"
7.6,"Harbhajan to Iyer, 1 run","falls short of deep midwicket! Shreyas hurries down the pitch to meet a delivery fired into his pads and lifts it gently over midwicket, but it almost seems like he's timed this too well and that it'll end up in Rayudu's hands as he hurries forward. Good effort from the fielder, especially to put his body behind the ball so that he could at least prevent the boundary"
7.5,"Harbhajan to Iyer, no run","loops it up on off stump, defends"
7.4,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length ball outside off, cuts through point"
7.3,"Harbhajan to Iyer, 1 run","again, he knows the batsman is coming down at him and fires it in flat and at the pads. Shreyas though is good enough to flick it for runs behind square leg"
7.2,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run",rocks back and slices the shortish delivery outside off to deep point
7.1,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, no run","spots Dhawan coming out of his crease and pulls his length back, forcing the batsman to defend to cover. Brilliant skill under pressure from Bhajji"
6.6,"Chahar to Iyer, no run","excellent bowling again, targeting the top of off, and also getting it to straighten enough to keep Shreyas to a block to point. Wraps up his spell 4-0-20-1"
6.5,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length on middle, Dhawan manages to turn it away behind square leg"
6.4,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run",opens the face to steer a good length ball on off stump away to third man
6.3,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run",waits for the short ball outside off and slashes it to deep point
6.2,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run",there's a nice cuurrrrrruch off the bat as Shreyas goes for the back foot punch through cover
6.1,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run",steps out and has to deal with another ball - this one angled across - bouncing a little more than he expects. Manages to get under it and lift over point
5.6,"Harbhajan to Iyer, no run",brings him forward with another deliciously flighted delivery outside off. Shreyas plays with a much straighter bat than the last ball and blocks to the bowler
5.5,"Harbhajan to Iyer, no run","nice and slow through the air to the new batsman though. Tossed up too. Shreyas ventures forward, tentatively, and gets a leading edge to cover"
5.4,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run",
5.3,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","reverse sweeps to the third man boundary. And it's the result of Dhawan picking up the fact Harbhajan wants to cramp him with non-turning offbreaks. So he knows the trajectory will be flat, and the line will be on leg stump, and so he uses all that to his advantage with an unorthodox shot"
5.2,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, no run","skids into him again, without turning, and almost seeming to hasten after pitching. Dhawan manages to squirt it to cover"
5.1,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, no run",goes back to the shortish delivery a shade outside off and punches it through extra cover
4.6,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length on middle, Dhawan defends and gets a bit of inside edge and pad to sneak a single as the ball wanders towards cover"
4.5,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run",moves across his crease to slices the back of a length delivery to cover
4.4,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run",gets inside the line of a ball sliding into leg stump and flicks it to deep square leg
4.3,"Chahar to Shaw, OUT","taken at midwicket! And all the credit should go to the bowler. First because he follows Shaw, who is trying to make room to access the off side again. Then he puts in enough effort that he derives extra bounce - which is beyond hard on this Delhi pitch. The batsman is cramped and he's committed to the big shot. Ends up with a slog that comes off the high part of the bat and ends up in Watson's hands"
4.2,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run",pulls the back of a length ball on middle to deep square leg
4.1,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run","goes for the on the up drive through the covers, but the ball holds on the pitch and messes with his timing"
3.6,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, 1 run",pushes it through from round the wicket and the offbreak skids into the left-hander after pitching on a good length on middle. Dhawan knocks it to mid-on easily and skips through for the single
3.5,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, no run","shortish and outside off, chops it into the covers"
3.4,"Harbhajan to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","sweeps it behind square. Splendid batting. It's tossed up outside off, and Dhawan gets a monster stride forward, gets his hands over the ball and then swings through beautifully"
3.3,"Harbhajan to Shaw, 1 run","lets it hang out there outside off and Shaw, who loves it there, goes for the cover drive. Two problems though: he tries to hits it too hard, and the ball dips and spins on him. Inside edge through midwicket"
3.3,"Harbhajan to Shaw, 1 wide",fires it through - shortening his length - down the leg side. Shaw tries to pull it away but can't connect
3.2,"Harbhajan to Shaw, FOUR runs","hares down the pitch, and with mid-off up, he lofts it over the infield. Superb tactics. Even better execution"
3.1,"Harbhajan to Shaw, no run","drifts the offbreak into the pads, Shaw turns it to square leg"
2.6,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run","back of a length on middle, nudges it to midwicket"
2.5,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run","oooh, stays low. That's trademark Kotla. Dhawan is expecting the back of a length delivery to come up at least to his waist and is prepared to run it behind point, But it slips well below that"
2.4,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run",thunders down the pitch - which is another sign the batsmen aren't too cool with the slow nature of this pitch - and misses the slash over cover
2.3,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run",takes the pace off and pulls the length back. Dhawan eases it into the covers off the back foot
2.2,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run","good length, angling across the left-hander, Dhawan drills it to cover"
2.1,"Chahar to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","outside edge. He doesn't move his feet, tentatively pushes the bat at a pitched-up outswinger. Gets lucky with a thick edge to third man"
1.6,"Thakur to Shaw, FOUR runs","sweet timing! And all he does is open the face of the bat. Lets the shortish ball outside off come on, meets it with the angled bat, specifically trying to beat third man on his left and he does so rather easily"
1.5,"Thakur to Shaw, FOUR runs",wallops it over mid-on - and this time he gets a dolly of a ball - short and outside off - giving him all the leverage he needs
1.4,"Thakur to Shaw, FOUR runs","outrageous hitting! Shaw hasn't been happy with the pace of this pitch. But even so, he picks up a ball that is nowhwere near short enough and pulls it straight of midwicket. Funny thing is, there's no room for him to free the hands either. But still, he short-arm jabs it away. Pure strength there from the youngster"
1.3,"Thakur to Shaw, no run","lovley bowling. Full but not full enough to drive. No room to work with either and as a result, Shaw has no choice but to block to mid-on"
1.2,"Thakur to Shaw, no run","goes hard at it the moment he sees a short ball outside off, but it's not quite wide enough, nor is the pitch quick enough for him to play through the line like that"
1.1,"Thakur to Shaw, no run",stays put in his crease and whips the pitched up delivery on middle to midwicket
0.6,"Chahar to Shaw, 1 run",inside edge as Shaw once again stays too legside of the ball and pokes his hands at a shortish delivery outside off.
0.5,"Chahar to Shaw, 2 runs","twists his body in trying to bring the bat in front of his pad, and tries to keep it as straight as possible too, wary of the awayswing Chahar gets. Good timing on the shot as it races away to the right of mid-on"
0.4,"Chahar to Shaw, no run",sweet punch into the covers - he's looking gorgeous off the back foot
0.3,"Chahar to Shaw, FOUR runs","short and down leg, Shaw picks it up early and pulls it away behind square leg"
0.3,"Chahar to Shaw, 1 wide",back of a length delivery wanders down leg as Shaw tries to pull
0.2,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","pops up towards mid-on as Shaw tries to flick a shortish delivery on his pads away through midwicket, but it stops on the pitch and nearly does him in"
0.1,"Chahar to Shaw, no run",hangs back and typically legside of the ball to tap it towards cover. Hint of away movement off the pitch from Chahar.
19.6,"Rajpoot to Kulkarni, 1 run","a slower length ball, pitching outside leg, the batsman backs away and pushes it towards long-on for one"
19.5,"Rajpoot to Kulkarni, FOUR runs","fuller outside off, takes his front leg out and smashes it through covers, beats the man at sweeper cover"
19.4,"Rajpoot to Kulkarni, no run","fuller outside off, in the blockhole, Kulkarni cannot put bat on that"
19.3,"Rajpoot to Gopal, 1 run",a full toss angling in towards the batsman who thuds it towards long-on
19.2,"Rajpoot to Gowtham, OUT","a low full toss, Gowtham looks to go aerial, over mid-off but ends up toe-ending it, Shami comes in from mid-off, juggles before completing the catch"
19.1,"Rajpoot to Unadkat, OUT","a short delivery, Unadkat goes for the pull but top-edges it and it lobs straight up, both the keeper and the bowler charge towards it, Rajpoot takes the catch but the two end up colliding and Pooran is on the ground"
18.6,"Shami to Unadkat, 1 run","a full toss on the stumps, Unadkat hits it towards long-on, only a single. An excellent over from Shami, only six from it"
18.5,"Shami to Archer, OUT","fuller again, in the blockhole, Archer backs away and looks to flick it on the leg side, misses. But he is already half-way down the track, the keeper goes for the direct hit but misses. Shami is there to collect the ball, he runs to the striker's end and whips off the bails"
18.4,"Shami to Archer, 2 runs","a yorker on the middle stump, Archer gets his bat down in time, the ball rolls towards midwicket but the fielder is deep, they come back for the second"
18.3,"Shami to Gowtham, 1 run","Shami goes for the yorker, backs away and steers it towards short third man"
18.2,"Shami to Gowtham, no run","a bouncer this time, but Gowtham fails to connect, a dot"
18.1,"Shami to Gowtham, 2 runs","length outside off, stays back and flat-bats it towards long-on, they are sprinting back for the second, Agarwal the fielder, but Shami fails to collect the throw"
17.6,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, OUT","a full toss on the leg stump, comes down the track and looks to clear long-on, but gets too close to the ball, and Rahul takes an easy catch at long-on"
17.5,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, no run","googly!? Length ball on the stumps, misses the sweep again and is hit on the body"
17.5,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, 1 wide","flatter but way outside off, looks to smash it away but misses, called a wide, marginal call"
17.4,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, no run","length ball on middle and leg, bowled at 99kph, looks to sweep it away, misses and is hit on the body"
17.3,"Mujeeb to Stokes, OUT","looks to repeat the shot but it's googly from Mujeeb, not that full either, Stokes has to adjust and he looks to go over long-on this time, doesn't get the timing right and Karun Nair takes an easy catch at long-on"
17.2,"Mujeeb to Stokes, SIX runs","fuller on the stumps, Stokes goes down and slog sweeps it over deep midwicket for biggie"
17.1,"Mujeeb to Tripathi, 1 run","fuller on the stumps, comes down the track and drills it towards long-on"
16.6,"Sam Curran to Samson, OUT","two in the over for Curran. It was once again a length ball but this time a touch away from the batsman who was looking to go down the ground, ends up slicing it over extra cover, Ashwin backpedals and takes it with fingers pointing upwards"
16.5,"Sam Curran to Samson, 2 runs","length around off, stays back and hits it over the bowler's head, not the best of the timings and that allows Samson to come back for the second"
16.4,"Sam Curran to Smith, OUT","what a catch! Fuller outside off and Smith has just chipped it wide of long-off, KL Rahul sprints from long-off, dives to his left, gets both hands to it and latches on even after he falls on the ground"
16.3,"Sam Curran to Samson, 1 run","length around off, stands tall and hits it through the line towards long-off"
16.2,"Sam Curran to Smith, 1 run","an appeal for lbw this time, this looks close and Kings XI have gone for it. A fuller one around the leg stump, Smith was moving across, misses the flick and is struck on the pads. UltraEdge shows a spike as the ball reaches the bat. Review lost"
16.1,"Sam Curran to Smith, no run","fuller outside off, Smith looks to drive through covers, misses. An appeal for caught-behind, certainly a noise but Kings XI are not reviewing this, think it was bat hitting the ground"
15.6,"Shami to Smith, 1 run","fuller outside off, Smith jams his bat at it for a single to long-on. Good comeback by Shami after being hit for a six off the first ball"
15.5,"Shami to Samson, 1 run","slower one, length ball on the stumps, flicked away behind square"
15.4,"Shami to Smith, 1 run","fuller around off, stays deep and digs it out towards long-on, was looking to come back for the second but the fielder was quick to the ball"
15.3,"Shami to Samson, 1 run","length ball on middle and leg, flicked towards square leg"
15.2,"Shami to Samson, SIX runs","fuller around off, gives himself a bit of room and lofts it over extra cover, all the way for a six, elegant shot, 83 metres"
15.1,"Shami to Smith, 1 run","fuller on the toes, digs it out towards midwicket for one"
14.6,"Sam Curran to Smith, 1 run","length around off, dabs it towards points and sneaks in a quick single"
14.5,"Sam Curran to Smith, SIX runs","wristy flick, what a shot, what timing on that. Fuller on the stumps and Smith goes back and across to flick it over deep square leg"
14.5,"Sam Curran to Smith, 1 wide","moves across again but it's way down the leg side, Smith throws his bat at it but cannot connect"
14.4,"Sam Curran to Smith, FOUR runs","fuller around off, moves across and slogs it towards deep midwicket, Mandeep puts in the dive but cannot stop it"
14.3,"Sam Curran to Smith, 2 runs","length around off, stays beside the line and punches it towards deep point for a couple"
14.2,"Sam Curran to Samson, 1 run","length ball around off, stands tall and smashes it towards long-on"
14.1,"Sam Curran to Samson, 2 runs","fuller and wider outside off, steers it towards the right of third man, Rajpoot fumbles and that allows the batsmen to come back for the second"
13.6,"Rajpoot to Smith, no run","short of length around off, comes forward and pushes it towards the bowler"
13.5,"Rajpoot to Samson, 1 run","short of length outside off, dabs it towards cover-point for one"
13.4,"Rajpoot to Smith, 1 leg bye","another slower one, Smith once again looks to go over long-on, misses and is hit on the pads, an appeal for lbw by the bowler but you cannot get lbws off free hit, Rajpoot supports a smile after he realises"
13.4,"Rajpoot to Smith, (no ball)","slower one outside off, Smith looks to send it out of the stadium, misses completely but wait, that's another no-ball. Even bigger than the last one"
13.4,"Rajpoot to Smith, (no ball) 2 runs","length around off, moves across and flicks it uppishly towards deep midwicket, it's a no-ball as well. Free hit coming up"
13.3,"Rajpoot to Samson, 1 run","length ball on the leg stump, tucked away towards midwicket for one"
13.2,"Rajpoot to Smith, 1 run","length outside off, makes the perfect connection this time, cuts it towards sweeper cover"
13.1,"Rajpoot to Smith, no run","length outside off, goes for the cut but misses"
12.6,"Ashwin to Samson, 2 runs","fuller around off, comes forward and pushes it towards mid-on, sprints back for the second and makes it safely"
12.5,"Ashwin to Samson, OUT","Ashwin has Mankaded Buttler here. And has appealed. Buttler is furious. Replays confirm Buttler was well outside his crease. He has to go back, not the best of the scenes here. Also, did Ashwin stop in his action and waited for Buttler to leave his crease? I think yes, but third umpire has ruled it out and Buttler has to go"
12.4,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run",
12.3,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","fuller on the pads, looks to go aerial, the ball hits the toe end of the bat but lands safe, well short of incoming long-on"
12.2,"Ashwin to Samson, no run","length outside off, feet doesn't move as Samson looks to play it on the off side, misses"
12.1,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run","fuller on the toes, digs it out in front of square"
11.6,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 1 run","a googly this time, goes back to pull but mistimes it towards square leg, the keeper fields himself"
11.5,"Mujeeb to Samson, 1 run","length around off, stays back and dabs it towards cover for one"
11.4,"Mujeeb to Samson, no run","length outside off, goes for the cut and misses"
11.3,"Mujeeb to Samson, 2 runs","length around off, goes back and flicks it towards midwicket, sprints back for the second, Samson takes on Agarwal's arm and makes it in the end"
11.2,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 1 run","length around off, goes back and nudges it towards long-on, the ball hurries on to the batsman"
11.1,"Mujeeb to Samson, 1 run","short of length outside off, goes back and pulls it towards wide long-on"

9.5,"Rajpoot to Buttler, 1 run","full, close to the blockhole, angling into off stump, punched firmly to extra-cover, who fumbles and allows a single"
9.4,"Rajpoot to Buttler, 2 runs","back of a length, wide of off stump, slapped away to the right of deep point"
9.3,"Rajpoot to Buttler, FOUR runs","bam. Length ball, close to off stump, and he makes a bit more room and shovels it over the covers. ""Universe Jos"", says the replay screen."
9.2,"Rajpoot to Buttler, FOUR runs","back of a length, angling into leg stump, and Buttler moves swiftly across his stumps and plays his favourite scoop to the right of short fine leg"
9.1,"Rajpoot to Samson, 1 run","full, angling into middle stump, and Samson drives it past the stumps at the other end, to the left of long-on"
8.6,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, another carrom ball, punched into the covers and Nair, diving right at extra-cover, stops it but can't prevent the single. Not sure who he's subbing for"

8.1,"Ashwin to Rahane, OUT","bowled him! Carrom ball, straightens towards off stump and skids off the pitch. Rahane was looking to stay leg-side of the ball and steer this down to third man. Ended up playing inside the line and the ball crashes into off stump"
7.6,"Rajpoot to Buttler, FOUR runs","after three excellent deliveries in sequence, he bowls a half-volley just outside off, and Buttler drives it crisply over mid-off to bring up yet another half-century. He's been churning them out ever since he began opening. These are his last seven IPL innings: 67, 51, 82, 95*, 94*, 39 and now 51*"
7.5,"Rajpoot to Buttler, no run","into the blockhole now, jams his bat down and digs it out, back towards the bowler"
7.4,"Rajpoot to Buttler, no run","follows up the slower ball with a cross-seam full-pace ball that skids off the pitch from a shortish length outside off, and beats Buttler's attempted back-foot jab"
7.3,"Rajpoot to Buttler, no run","fullish slower ball, close to off stump. Looks to clear his front leg and wallop it down the ground, ends up getting a thick inside edge into his boot, and Rajpoot was momentarily enthused into charging towards the batsman in his follow-through, hoping for the ball to balloon up towards him"
7.2,"Rajpoot to Rahane, 1 run","full on off stump, clipped elegantly between the non-striker's legs, down to long-on"
7.1,"Rajpoot to Rahane, 2 runs","back of a length on middle stump, lets it come on and clips it to the left of deep square leg, immediately calls for two"
6.6,"Ashwin to Rahane, 1 run","flat offbreak turning towards middle stump, goes deep in his crease and punches to long-on"
6.5,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run","full on middle and off, whipped to deep midwicket"
6.4,"Ashwin to Rahane, 1 run","flat, back-of-a-length carrom ball outside off, opens his bat face and dabs to the left of short third man"
6.3,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run","legbreak, full outside off, drives to the left of extra-cover this time and he dives and makes another partial stop"
6.2,"Ashwin to Buttler, 2 runs","flighted offbreak outside off, stretches out to drive and extra-cover, diving right, gets a hand on it but can't stop it completely"
6.1,"Ashwin to Rahane, 1 run","flat, full, angling down leg, clipped down to deep backward square leg"
5.6,"Sam Curran to Buttler, FOUR runs","oh man, this is carnage. Back of a length, a bit of width, and Buttler slaps it away to the left of extra-cover to make it 19 off the over"
5.5,"Sam Curran to Buttler, FOUR runs","looks for the wide yorker, and ends up bowling a wide, low full-toss. Buttler does well to reach out and slice it away between backward point and short third man"
5.4,"Sam Curran to Buttler, SIX runs","short, hip-high ball angling into off stump. May have cramped another batsman for room, but Buttler swings his left leg out of the way and in the process generates plenty of power through his hips, which he complements with the power of his bottom hand to swat it down the ground, to the left of mid-on"
5.3,"Sam Curran to Buttler, no run",sees Buttler looking to make room and follows him with a full ball. Driven to extra-cover
5.2,"Sam Curran to Buttler, FOUR runs","short, wide, freebie. Buttler slashes it away, up and over backward point"
5.1,"Sam Curran to Rahane, 1 run","slower one, angling into middle and leg. Closes his face early on the flick and sends a leading edge towards long-on"
4.6,"Shami to Buttler, no run","back of a length, angling into middle stump, whipped towards midwicket"
4.5,"Shami to Buttler, 2 runs","a bit fuller, on off stump, and it might have been a slightly off-pace delivery. Yup, slower one. Buttler goes for the lofted drive, and slices it high off the outside half of his bat, manages to land it beyond the reach of extra-cover turning and running back"
4.4,"Shami to Buttler, no run","on the shorter side of a good length in the fifth-stump channel, and Buttler, standing still and looking to thrash an angled-bat drive into the covers, is beaten by the pace and extra bounce"
4.3,"Shami to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, lets it come to him and steers it down to third man"
4.2,"Shami to Rahane, FOUR runs","put away. Back of a length, too straight, angling into the hip, and Rahane uses the pace and helps it away to the left of short fine leg, with a wristy half-pull"
4.1,"Shami to Rahane, no run","back of a length, a bit of nip back towards middle and off, clipped to midwicket"
3.6,"Mujeeb to Buttler, SIX runs","a bit of width, a rarity from Mujeeb. Drops a bit short too, and Buttler rocks back and lofts this down the ground with a pretty much straight-bat shovelling action, over mid-off, and connects so well it carries all the way"
3.5,"Mujeeb to Buttler, no run","back of a length, top of off stump, makes room and slaps to cover point"
3.4,"Mujeeb to Buttler, FOUR runs","googly, pitching just outside off and perhaps a little slower than what he's been bowling so far. Clears his front leg and clubs it with a lot of bottom hand, past the bowler and to the right of mid-off"
3.3,"Mujeeb to Buttler, no run","back of a length on off stump, makes room and punches to extra-cover"
3.2,"Mujeeb to Buttler, no run","not short enough to pull from outside off, and it skids through a little low. Drags it without power to midwicket, off the inside half of the bat"
3.1,"Mujeeb to Rahane, 1 run","back of a length on middle stump, punched to long-on"
2.6,"Shami to Buttler, no run","back of a length, gets it to straighten off the pitch into a fourth-stump line. Was looking to play that towards mid-on or midwicket initially, and ends up sending a thick leading edge towards backward point"
2.5,"Shami to Buttler, no run","length ball on off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
2.4,"Shami to Buttler, FOUR runs","shot. That's lightning footwork, because he was shaping to move across his stumps, but he waited and waited and only made his move an instant before Shami released. He sends down a back-of-a-length ball angling into the stumps, and Buttler scoops it away fine, well to the right of short fine leg"
2.3,"Shami to Buttler, no run","back of a length on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
2.2,"Shami to Buttler, FOUR runs","shot. Full, just outside off, and Buttler plays a straight-bat punch that hangs in the air briefly but finds the gap to the left of mid-off"
2.1,"Shami to Rahane, 1 run","length ball angling into off stump, Rahane presses forward for a straight-bat push to mid-on"
1.6,"Mujeeb to Buttler, no run","again that skiddy pace, angling into off stump and straightening slightly. Stays back to punch to mid-off"
1.5,"Mujeeb to Buttler, no run","flat and quick, back of a length outside off. Not enough room to cut, and it's past his edge by the time he can create some and bring his bat down"
1.4,"Mujeeb to Rahane, 1 run","no real turn, looks like the attempted legbreak angling into middle and leg. Goes back again to clip into the square leg region"
1.3,"Mujeeb to Rahane, no run","goes back to a length ball angling into off stump, defends into the covers"
1.2,"Mujeeb to Buttler, 1 run","flat again, on the stumps, hangs back to punch to long-on"
1.1,"Mujeeb to Buttler, FOUR runs","full and flat, angling onto the pads, and Buttler tickles it away fine, quickly past the right hand of the diving short fine leg fielder, Gayle"
0.6,"Sam Curran to Rahane, FOUR runs","four more, perhaps the best shot of the lot. Not as full this time, angling across to off stump, and Rahane transfers his weight forward into a straight-bat push that accelerates quickly over the turf and beats mid-off diving to his right"
0.5,"Sam Curran to Rahane, FOUR runs","length ball, angling away from off stump and allowing the batsman to free his arms, and Rahane flows forward for a lofted chip over extra-cover. Excellent timing"
0.4,"Sam Curran to Rahane, no run","fullish outside off, gets on the front foot for a push to cover point"
0.3,"Sam Curran to Rahane, FOUR runs","overpitched outside off, and Rahane is on his way with a crisp drive between the non-striker's legs and to the right of mid-off"
0.2,"Sam Curran to Rahane, no run","back of a length close to off stump, gets back and across to punch to short extra"
0.1,"Sam Curran to Rahane, no run","length ball on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
19.6,"Stokes to Khan, SIX runs","another slower one, fuller outside off and Sarfaraz has smashed it over deep midwicket and has got enough behind it to clear the boundary on the full"
19.5,"Stokes to Mandeep, 3 runs","another slower one but down the leg side, goes for the sweep but ends up skying it towards fine leg, the fielder sprints in, puts in the dive but it falls short, fails to get his body behind and concedes three, Stokes is not impressed"
19.4,"Stokes to Mandeep, 2 runs","a slower one, in the blockhole outside off, digs it out towards long-off, comes back for the second"
19.3,"Stokes to Khan, 1 run","short of length on the body, pulls it towards deep square leg"
19.2,"Stokes to Khan, FOUR runs","length ball around off, Sarfaraz bends low and scoops it over, towards third man for four"
19.2,"Stokes to Khan, 1 wide","fuller but down the leg side, looks to sweep it away but misses"
19.1,"Stokes to Pooran, OUT","fuller but wide outside off, rolled his fingers over it as well. Pooran looks to clear long-off but ends up hitting it straight into the hands of Rahane at long-off"
18.6,"Unadkat to Pooran, 1 run","fuller on the stumps, digs it out towards long-on for one"
18.5,"Unadkat to Khan, 1 run","slower one outside off, Sarfaraz was looking go leg side initially but adjusts to slap it towards sweeper cover, only a single though"
18.4,"Unadkat to Khan, FOUR runs","fuller and wider outside off, looks to go over cover but ends up slicing it behind point but gets a boundary nonetheless"
18.3,"Unadkat to Pooran, 1 run","slower one again, this time a length ball on the stumps, pulls it towards behind square for one"
18.3,"Unadkat to Pooran, 1 wide","a slower bouncer, Pooran is deep in his crease and looks to pull it away, misses but the umpire reckons it's too high"
18.2,"Unadkat to Pooran, FOUR runs","one-bounce four, fuller but much closer to the batsman this time who lofts it over extra cover, Archer from sweeper cover sprints to his left but cannot get there in time"
18.1,"Unadkat to Pooran, no run","fuller and wider outside off, Pooran was looking to back away and in the end can only watch it go through"
17.6,"Archer to Pooran, 1 run","length around off this time, pulls it towards deep square leg for one"
17.5,"Archer to Pooran, no run","a slower one this time, length ball, following the batsman. Pooran goes for the pull but ends up playing it too early, misses"
17.4,"Archer to Pooran, no run","a bouncer this time, following Pooran who sways away from it. Excellent bowling this from Archer, mixing it up well"
17.3,"Archer to Khan, 1 run","a full toss following the batsman who was shuffling in his crease, hits it towards extra cover in the end"
17.2,"Archer to Khan, 2 runs","short of length around off, a short-arm pull towards the right of deep midwicket"
17.1,"Archer to Pooran, 1 run","fuller on the pads, flicked away towards short fine leg, Unadkat makes a diving stop to his right, saves three for his side"

16.5,"Gopal to Pooran, 1 run","short of length on middle and leg, pulls it towards deep midwicket for one"
16.4,"Gopal to Pooran, 2 runs","length ball on the pads, chipped away towards wide long-on for a couple, Sarfaraz is down on the ground after the ball hit him near his stomach. A direct-hit and he would have been out there"
16.3,"Gopal to Pooran, no run","flatter, length outside off, goes back and punches it towards extra cover, a tumbling stop"
16.2,"Gopal to Khan, 1 run","length outside off, shuffles before getting down on one knee to sweep it towards deep midwicket"
16.1,"Gopal to Pooran, 1 run","fuller on the stumps, drives it towards long-on and is off the mark"
15.6,"Stokes to Pooran, 1 leg bye","length ball on the pads, looks to tuck it away behind square, misses but will get a leg-bye"
15.5,"Stokes to Gayle, OUT","Gayle is furious with himself. Tripathi keeps his calm at deep midwicket boundary. Was a short one outside off, Gayle went for the pull but doesn't get the distance on this, Tripathi times his jump perfectly, both feet in the air when he pouched it. A big, big wicket"
15.4,"Stokes to Gayle, FOUR runs","length ball around off, doesn't matter for Gayle, he knows where to dispatch it, over the bowler's head for another boundary"
15.4,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 wide","slower one gone wrong, full but way too wide outside off"
15.3,"Stokes to Gayle, FOUR runs","almost a repeat of the first ball, but Gayle doesn't middle it this time, a thick outside edge though flies towards third man fence for another boundary"
15.2,"Stokes to Gayle, 4 byes","fuller this time, following the batsman and managing to sneak this through his legs but Buttler misses as well, bounces to his right and races away for four"
15.1,"Stokes to Gayle, SIX runs","fuller around off, Gayle's method is simple, clears his front leg and smashes it over long-off, his fourth six of the innings"
14.6,"Kulkarni to Khan, FOUR runs","short of length around off, pace offered this time and Sarfaraz gets his timing right on the pull, four to midwicket"
14.5,"Kulkarni to Khan, 2 runs","115kph, banged in short, Sarfaraz scoops it over the keeper's head but the lack of pace means he would have to be happy with a couple only"
14.4,"Kulkarni to Gayle, 1 run","fuller on the pads, Gayle stays in the crease and drives it towards midwicket"
14.3,"Kulkarni to Khan, 1 run","slower length ball outside off, Sarfaraz was looking to swipe it on the leg side, ends up dragging it towards short midwicket"
14.2,"Kulkarni to Gayle, 1 run","slower length ball outside off, Gayle stays back and hits it towards long-off"
14.1,"Kulkarni to Khan, 1 run","short of length outside off, takes it from there and pulls it towards deep square leg, more like drag than a pull, hardly any timing on it"
13.6,"Archer to Khan, 1 run","length ball but down the leg side, helps it towards fine leg"
13.5,"Archer to Gayle, 1 run","a low full toss angling on to the pads, Gayle though stays leg side of the ball and hits it towards wide long-on"
13.4,"Archer to Gayle, SIX runs","slower length ball around off, Gayle clears his front leg and smashes it over the bowler's head for a maximum"
13.3,"Archer to Khan, 1 run","length around off, dabs it towards short midwicket and sets off for a quick single"
13.2,"Archer to Khan, no run","length outside off, a slower one, Sarfaraz was looking to scoop it first but the line is not ideal, looks to open the face but that's too late, gets beaten"
13.1,"Archer to Gayle, 1 run","fuller on the stumps, Gayle takes his front leg out and hits it towards midwicket"
12.6,"Gowtham to Gayle, 1 run","flat again, on leg stump, and he nurdles it to the left of midwicket to pick up one"
12.5,"Gowtham to Gayle, no run","fired in flat, angling slightly down leg. Looks to sweep and misses, is hit on the pad to provoke a half-appeal from Gowtham"
12.4,"Gowtham to Khan, 1 run","a bit closer to the stumps, swept down to long leg"
12.3,"Gowtham to Khan, FOUR runs","a bit slower and wider outside off, and that's another superb shot. Stretches out and gets down low to sweep it, bat coming down from a high, wide backlift - just as you're coached while learning the sweep - and spanks it along the ground to the square leg boundary"
12.2,"Gowtham to Khan, FOUR runs","overpitched, lots of width, and that's a lovely wristy drive, drilled to the right of extra-cover and beats long-off easily with all that power"
12.1,"Gowtham to Gayle, 1 run","back of a length and flat on off stump, eased through the covers with an open face"
11.6,"Unadkat to Khan, no run","length ball on middle and off, jabbed back to the bowler from the crease"
11.5,"Unadkat to Gayle, 1 run","length ball wide outside off, opens his bat face and steers to sweper cover"
11.4,"Unadkat to Gayle, SIX runs","wow. This is close to the blockhole outside off stump, misses it by a few inches maybe, and Gayle, who's taken a big step back and across to shorten the length, lofts it high and straight, back over the bowler's head and into the sightscreen to bring up fifty. Just stands there and watches it soar, what a shot"
11.3,"Unadkat to Gayle, FOUR runs","shortish, just outside off. Takes one step back and across and times the pants off a short-arm jab to bisect deep midwicket and long-on"
11.2,"Unadkat to Gayle, FOUR runs","short, wide, and that's excellent placement, reaches out and cuts it away to the left of the diving fielder at short third man. Wrong length and line to bowl with that fielder in the circle"
11.1,"Unadkat to Gayle, FOUR runs","and Gayle whacks it back, over the wicket at the other end. Short slower one outside off, and he clears his front leg and absolutely hammers it back, forcing the umpire to duck hurriedly"
10.6,"Stokes to Khan, no run",looks to create room and Stokes makes him reach for the ball with a quick short one that skids past his attempted  slash
10.5,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 run","quicker length ball on the stumps, jabbed down the ground, past the stumps and to the right of long-on"
10.4,"Stokes to Gayle, FOUR runs","shortish slower ball, angling into middle stump. Keeps a touch low too, and Gayle does extremely well to generate power on this leg-side whip. Samson, sprinting to his left from deep square leg and throwing himself at the ball, can't quite stop it from running past him into the boundary"
10.3,"Stokes to Khan, 1 run","slower length ball angling into off stump, takes a big step back and across and late-cuts to third man"
10.2,"Stokes to Khan, no run","back of a length close to off stump, stabbed with an open face to backward point"
10.1,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 run","shortish, angling into the batsman's hip. Tucked away to long leg"
9.6,"Kulkarni to Khan, FOUR runs","shot. Third man is fine, and Kulkarni bangs in a short ball that rises to shoulder height close to off stump. Sarfaraz makes room and uppercuts it, a long way to the right of that fielder"
9.5,"Kulkarni to Gayle, 1 run","slower short ball, offcutter, loses a lot of pace as it angles away from off stump and it's on its way down when Gayle flicks it through midwicket"
9.5,"Kulkarni to Gayle, 1 wide","slower ball, shortish, angling away into a sixth-stump line. Left alone, and the umpire signals wide - tight call, I thought"
9.4,"Kulkarni to Khan, 1 run","length ball on middle and off, clipped to deep midwicket"
9.3,"Kulkarni to Khan, no run","back of a length on off stump, blocked back again, waits for it and meets it right under his eye"
9.2,"Kulkarni to Khan, no run","back of a length again, and this time it straightens towards an off-stump line. Is opened up slightly while defending back to the bowler"
9.1,"Kulkarni to Khan, no run","back of a length on off stump, keeps a little low and Sarfaraz blocks it back to the bowler"
8.6,"Gowtham to Khan, 1 run","tossed up outside off, stretches out to drive to long-off"
8.5,"Gowtham to Agarwal, OUT","gone, one Karnataka player gets another. Length ball on off stump and Agarwal goes for the big loft down the ground. Gets a touch too much underneath the ball, I thought, so he gets slightly more elevation and slightly less distance than intended. Kulkarni takes a great catch at long-off, jumping backwards with his arms up over his head, and he cups it with both hands even as his back foot lands perilously close to the boundary cushions. Does really well not to step on or beyond them even with his weight going backwards"
8.4,"Gowtham to Gayle, 1 leg bye","another dart angling down leg. Gayle looks to sweep and gets a bit of thigh pad on it, rolls into the short fine leg region"
8.4,"Gowtham to Gayle, 1 wide","flat and quick again, fires it down the leg side once more in the effort to cramp Gayle for room"
8.3,"Gowtham to Gayle, 2 leg byes","back of a length, fired down the leg side, helped along to the right of long leg and he charges down the pitch and back for a second"
8.2,"Gowtham to Gayle, no run","flatter and quicker on off stump, quite full, and Gayle, moving deep in his crease premeditatedly, defends into the covers"
8.1,"Gowtham to Gayle, SIX runs","length ball on off stump, and Gayle has had enough of waiting and watching. Clears his front leg while simultaneously sinking onto his back knee, and he sends a mighty slog-sweep high over wide long-on"
7.6,"Unadkat to Agarwal, no run","length ball, angling into middle stump. Gets forward and pushes to short extra-cover"
7.5,"Unadkat to Agarwal, no run","back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and dabs to the left of backward point. Calls for a quick single but Gayle sends him back"
7.4,"Unadkat to Agarwal, SIX runs","length ball on off stump, and Agarwal, staying leg-side of the ball, lofts it high and clean over extra-cover"
7.3,"Unadkat to Gayle, 1 run","back of a length outside off, slower ball again, waits and chops it away through point"
7.2,"Unadkat to Gayle, 2 runs","lucky. Digs in a short offcutter and Gayle, who was stepping out premeditatedly, is surprised, ends up playing something between a pull and a flick, and sends a top edge looping over the keeper's head"
7.1,"Unadkat to Gayle, FOUR runs","back of a length outside off, and Gayle puts it away cleverly, waits on it and dabs it late and dabs it fine. Third man is back, but he's too square to be able to cut this off"
6.6,"Gowtham to Agarwal, no run","quickish length ball wide of off, gets down low for a front-foot cut to backward point"
6.5,"Gowtham to Gayle, 1 run","flat, fired in towards middle stump, just short of a good length. Worked away to long leg"
6.4,"Gowtham to Agarwal, 1 run","flat length ball just outside off, stretches out to sweep to deep square leg"
6.3,"Gowtham to Gayle, 1 run","back of a length once more, on off stump, punched to long-off"
6.2,"Gowtham to Gayle, 2 runs","shorter, slapped down to long-off, punched firmly to the left of extra-cover"
6.1,"Gowtham to Gayle, no run","flighted length ball outside off, driven to extra-cover"
5.6,"Archer to Agarwal, no run","back of a length, nipping in towards middle and off with steep bounce. Hops to ride the bounce and keep it down"
5.5,"Archer to Agarwal, no run","back of a length on off stump, defended back towards the bowler"
5.4,"Archer to Agarwal, no run","does Agarwal for pace. Was again looking to make room to play through the off side, and he bowls a 142kph back-of-a-length ball on fourth stump that zips past the outside edge of his attempted slap, extra bounce too"
5.3,"Archer to Gayle, 1 run","back of a length, fourth-stump line, flat-batted to the left of mid-off"
5.2,"Archer to Gayle, no run","full slower ball on off stump, drags a cross-batted drive to mid-on"
5.1,"Archer to Gayle, no run","fast, accurate yorker, angling in sharply towards leg stump, and Gayle hurriedly pulls his feet away from the line and clips to midwicket"
4.6,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 run","back of a length, angling into off stump. Looks to clear his front leg and swat this down the ground, but only manages a thick inside edge to short fine leg"
4.5,"Stokes to Gayle, no run","back of a length, angling away into a fifth-stump line. Stops on Gayle a little as he shapes to slap through the covers, and he ends up dragging it back to the bowler"
4.5,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 wide","looks for the wide yorker, I think, ends up sliding it a lot wider than intended, and Gayle leaves it alone"
4.4,"Stokes to Gayle, 2 runs","shortish on off stump, jumps back and across and punches crisply with a straight bat to the left of midwicket. Lovely timing"
4.3,"Stokes to Agarwal, 1 run","full slower one angling into leg stump. Stokes delivers from past the vertical and creates this sharp inward angle, and that, coupled with the lack of pace, makes Agarwal's lofted hit go weakly in the air, on the bounce, to the right of mid-on, off the inner half of the bat"
4.2,"Stokes to Agarwal, no run","shorter, closer to off stump, dabbed to backward point"
4.1,"Stokes to Agarwal, FOUR runs","he was denied width all through the previous over, and now Stokes gifts him acres of it. Fullish and wide, and he gratefully slaps it away to the right of backward point"
3.6,"Archer to Agarwal, 1 run",sees Agarwal backing away to make room and follows him with a slower short ball at his chest. Jabbed down the ground to mid-on
3.5,"Archer to Agarwal, no run","short now, gets up to chest height on off stump. Hops to ride the bounce and defends with soft hands"
3.4,"Archer to Agarwal, no run","back of a length, a bit of inward movement towards middle and leg to cramp Agarwal once again. Opens his bat face and squeezes it to backward point"
3.3,"Archer to Agarwal, no run","length ball on off stump, punched firmly to mid-off. He sets off looking for a single but Gayle, rightly, sends him back"
3.2,"Archer to Agarwal, no run","back of a length, 142kph, angling into middle stump and denying Agarwal room as he tries to create some. Dabbed gently to backward point"
3.1,"Archer to Agarwal, no run","fullish, angling into the pads, clipped to midwicket"
2.6,"Kulkarni to Agarwal, 1 run","short of length outside off, stays back and taps it towards the right of third man"
2.5,"Kulkarni to Gayle, 1 run","slower length ball around off, Gayle pushes it towards mid-off and sets off, a fumble there by Samson means he makes it easily, and that's 4000 IPL runs for Gayle - the fastest to reach there"
2.5,"Kulkarni to Gayle, 1 wide","a bouncer this time from Kulkarni, on middle and leg but it's too high and has been called a wide"
2.4,"Kulkarni to Gayle, FOUR runs","length outside off, a bit of width this time, Gayle pushes it in the gap between cover and point, not from the middle of the bat but it races away towards the boundary"
2.3,"Kulkarni to Gayle, no run","another slower one, length outside off, Gayle comes forward and pushes it towards cover-point"
2.2,"Kulkarni to Gayle, no run","slower one outside off, Gayle was beaten by the lack of pace, looks to open the face of the bat in the end and misses"
2.1,"Kulkarni to Gayle, no run","length ball on the pads, goes for the flick but misses, a mild enquiry for lbw but think it landed outside the leg stump"
1.6,"Gowtham to Agarwal, no run","short of length around off, a bit of turn as well, Agarwal comes forward and pushes it back"
1.5,"Gowtham to Gayle, 1 run","fuller, angled in to the batsman, pushed towards mid-on for one, off the mark"
1.4,"Gowtham to Gayle, no run","length around off, comes forward and guides it towards short third man"
1.3,"Gowtham to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball on the pads, tucked away towards midwicket for one"
1.2,"Gowtham to Agarwal, SIX runs","a touch fuller this time, outside off, Agarwal stays leg side of the ball and frees his arms to loft it over mid-off, and it sails all the way"

0.6,"Kulkarni to Gayle, no run","length on middle and leg, Gayle flicks it towards square leg"

0.5,"Kulkarni to Agarwal, 1 wide","length ball but down the leg side this time, goes for the flick but too far away"
0.4,"Kulkarni to Rahul, OUT","what a catch! Length outside off, once again a bit of movement away, it wasn't there for the drive but Rahul followed it with his hands, got an outside edge and Buttler dived low to his right, taking it one-handed"
0.3,"Kulkarni to Rahul, no run","length but way outside off this time, a hint of shape away as well, left alone"
0.2,"Kulkarni to Rahul, FOUR runs","length around off, comes forward and drives it on the up, through covers for four, a check drive"
0.1,"Kulkarni to Rahul, no run","length around off, Rahul looks to defend, skids on and hits the toe end and dribbles towards Smith at first slip"
19.2,"Tewatia to McClenaghan, OUT","whoops. A bit more flight outside off and McClenaghan swings too early, looking to slog with the turn. The ball slides past his bat and he drags his back foot out of the crease briefly, just long enough for Pant to knock off the bails"
19.1,"Tewatia to McClenaghan, no run",flat length ball outside off. Looks for the slog-sweep and only manages an inside-edge into his pad
18.6,"Rabada to McClenaghan, 1 run","shortish, close to off stump, pulled along the ground to deep square leg"
18.5,"Rabada to Rasikh Salam, 1 run","slower ball, full and angling into the batsman as he backs away, looking to make room. Lofted down to long-on, on the bounce"
18.4,"Rabada to Rasikh Salam, 2 runs","full on off stump and he makes room to drive this over extra-cover. Ingram jumps up, right arm outstretched, and gets a fingertip to the ball, so I guess that counts as a half-chance"
18.3,"Rabada to Rasikh Salam, no run","slower yorker, looks to make room and play through the covers but the angle cancels out that room. Blocked back to the bowler"
18.2,"Rabada to Rasikh Salam, 2 runs","back of a length close to off stump, punched to the right of deep point"
18.1,"Rabada to Yuvraj, OUT","that's that, I guess. Full on leg stump, Yuvraj flicks it, and picks out the man at deep midwicket. It's been a struggle for Yuvraj, punctuated by flashes of the old strokeplay, and he walks off with a fighting fifty to his name"
18.1,"Rabada to Yuvraj, 1 wide","another attempted yorker, looking to deny Yuvraj room, another wide down the leg side"
18.1,"Rabada to Yuvraj, 1 wide","looks for the yorker, ends up angling it down leg side. Yuvraj can't connect with the flick"
17.6,"Boult to McClenaghan, FOUR runs","full, lots of width, and McClenaghan carves it away in the air, out of reach of the leaping cover fielder"
17.5,"Boult to McClenaghan, no run","excellent yorker, aimed right at the feet of the batsman and he can't connect with his flick. Hit on the pads but it's angling down leg, so no appeal"
17.4,"Boult to Yuvraj, 1 run","shortish, close to off stump, clears his front leg and clubs this down to long-on. Takes the single this time"
17.3,"Boult to Yuvraj, FOUR runs","slog, edge, boundary, fifty. This is a strange, stop-start innings, lacking fluency for most part, but he's still there, and he slogs at this length ball outside off and gets a thick edge that races away to the right of short third man"
17.2,"Boult to Yuvraj, no run","back of a length, angling into off and middle, blocked back to the bowler"
17.1,"Boult to Yuvraj, no run","full, angling into off stump, whips it away to long leg and refuses the single. Why?!?!?! McClenaghan's just hit a cleverly executed boundary, and he must have faced Boult a far bit in the nets?"
16.6,"Rabada to McClenaghan, FOUR runs","shot. Premeditates, walks across his stumps, and gets a full-toss angling into him. Uses the angle to help it away to the left of short fine leg"
16.5,"Rabada to Yuvraj, 1 run","once again, he sends one ballooning into a vacant space. Rabada's bouncer gets up above his back shoulder. and he miscues the attempted pull high in the air, without any power, but midwicket is back on the boundary"
16.4,"Rabada to McClenaghan, 1 run","full-toss outside off, jabbed down the ground towards long-on, off the inside half of the bat"
16.3,"Rabada to McClenaghan, no run","awkward bounce from a good length, and McClenaghan, doubling up while looking to work it leg-side, is hit on the back thigh"
16.2,"Rabada to Cutting, OUT","serious pace again, and Rabada might just have sent back Mumbai's last recognised batsman. Fullish, but not on a driving length, in the corridor, and Cutting doesn't have any time to get a proper stride in to drive. Ends up playing away from his body, as a result, with an angled bat, and the ball zips past the edge or kisses it through to Pant. The umpire gives Cutting out, but he seems unsure whether he edged it or not. Consults with Yuvraj and reviews, but UltraEdge shows a little spike as the ball goes past his edge, and he'll have to walk back"
16.2,"Rabada to Yuvraj, 2 wide","that's seriously quick, a misdirected yorker angling down leg. Pant, moving to his right, fumbles after Yuvraj misses his flick, and they sneak a bye"
16.1,"Rabada to Cutting, 1 run","low full-toss wide of off, stabbed away to deep point"
15.6,"Axar Patel to Yuvraj, SIX runs","bam. Axar sends down a long-hop, and Yuvraj swivels and deposits it high over the square leg boundary"
15.5,"Axar Patel to Cutting, 1 run","shortish, angling into the stumps, pulled to deep midwicket"
15.4,"Axar Patel to Yuvraj, 1 run","what happened here. Stops on the pitch, maybe. Shortish, and he's too early into the pull. Skews it high but into no-man's land as long-on and deep midwicket try to sprint forward to reach it before it bounces"
15.3,"Axar Patel to Yuvraj, SIX runs","flat length ball speared across Yuvraj, wide of off stump. It allows Yuvraj  to free his arms, and he launches it high and straight, back over the bowler's head and off the middle of his bat"
15.2,"Axar Patel to Cutting, 1 run","back of a length, angling into leg stump, clipped away to wide long-on"
15.1,"Axar Patel to Yuvraj, 1 run","floated up across the left-hander, lands outside off. Swiped down to long-on"
14.6,"Boult to Krunal, OUT","got him, ends a threatening cameo with the slower ball. It's fairly full and angling into middle stump. Krunal has to make all the power himself, and he clears his front leg and slogs it away but can't clear the man at deep midwicket"
14.5,"Boult to Krunal, no run","good yorker on a fifth-stump line, sneaks it under Krunal's bat as he attempts to jab it through the off side"
14.4,"Boult to Krunal, FOUR runs","thigh-high full-toss on off stump, and Krunal clubs it back fiercely, leaving the bowler on his backside and the umpire ducking"
14.3,"Boult to Yuvraj, 1 run","yorker now, much closer to off stump. Jams his bat down on it and squeezes it a few yards away square on the off side"
14.3,"Boult to Yuvraj, 1 wide","goes for the wide yorker, and that's a borderline wide call, the ball hovering right over the tramline. Yuvraj leaves it alone"
14.2,"Boult to Krunal, 1 run","slower ball, full and wide of off, swiped along the ground to long-on"
14.1,"Boult to Krunal, FOUR runs","full-toss on the pads, and he whips it away gratefully to the backward square leg boundary"
13.6,"Sharma to Krunal, 1 run","short ball on off stump, pulled to the right of deep square leg"
13.5,"Sharma to Krunal, FOUR runs","another misdirected wide yorker, ends up as a low full-toss wide of off stump, and Krunal does really well to reach out and slash it away, deliberately slicing underneath the ball, to beat short third man diving to his left"
13.4,"Sharma to Krunal, FOUR runs","overpitched outside off, and Krunal just stands where he is and slap-drives it, leaving deep point rooted to the ball while the ball flashes to the boundary to his left"
13.3,"Sharma to Krunal, no run","slower ball, back of a length and angling away from off stump. Not too much room for the cut, and he slashes and misses"
13.2,"Sharma to Krunal, no run","responds with the wide yorker and Krunal fails to put bat on it, reaching out to try and slash it away"
13.1,"Sharma to Krunal, SIX runs","and that's an extraordinary shot. Short-of-good-length delivery, angling across him on this bouncy pitch, and he clears his front leg and shovels it - something between a drive and a pull - over mid-on and gets it to carry all the way"
12.6,"Paul to Krunal, 1 run","another slower short ball, and this time it's Krunal's turn to get through a pull too early. The ball hits him smack on the stomach"
12.6,"Paul to Krunal, 1 wide","slower short ball outside leg, Krunal misses the attempted hook"
12.5,"Paul to Krunal, FOUR runs","another slower ball, but he overpitches this time, on off stump, and Krunal holds his shape, keeps his front leg out of the way, and drives firmly between umpire and non-striker"
12.4,"Paul to Yuvraj, 1 run","back of a length on middle stump, tucked away to long leg"
12.3,"Paul to Yuvraj, no run","another slower bouncer, angled across and gets up to chest height on off stump. Swivels too early again, misses, and is dealt a painful blow to the chest"
12.2,"Paul to Yuvraj, no run","slower bouncer outside leg, swivels too early to hook and only gets glove on it. Bounces down gently towards the keeper"
12.1,"Paul to Yuvraj, no run","slower ball on off stump, stays back and defends it back to the bowler"
11.6,"Axar Patel to Krunal, 2 runs","down the track, doesn't quite reach the pitch of this off-stump ball, swipes across the line and drags it along the floor through midwicket"
11.5,"Axar Patel to Yuvraj, 1 run","length ball, fired across wide of off stump, slapped to deep cover"
11.4,"Axar Patel to Yuvraj, 2 runs","floated across towards off stump, looks for the slog-sweep but can only drag it along the floor through square leg"
11.3,"Axar Patel to Krunal, 1 run","a bit of flight, drops onto a nice length on off stump. Drives without really getting fully forward, the ball rolls away through midwicket off the inner half of the bat"
11.2,"Axar Patel to Pandya, OUT","another batsman falls to a ball that stops on him. Length ball, angling in towards off stump, holds on the pitch and bounces extra, and Pandya checks his drive and pops back the simplest of return catches, at waist height"
11.1,"Axar Patel to Pandya, no run","flat length ball on off stump, driven to mid-off"
10.6,"Paul to Yuvraj, no run","full on the pads, Yuvraj plays a little early, looking to flick, ends up playing it back to the bowler"
10.5,"Paul to Pollard, OUT","gone, excellent bit of deception. Fullish, angling in towards off stump, and Pollard doesn't pick the knuckle-ball. Drives at it, plays too early, checks his shot, and all he achieves is to balloon a simple catch to Tewatia at sweeper cover"
10.4,"Paul to Yuvraj, 1 run","back of a length outside off, opens his bat face and picks up a single to third man"
10.3,"Paul to Yuvraj, FOUR runs","fuller, a little closer to off stump, and that's a super shot, just a front-foot punch with aborted follow-through to clear the right hand of the leaping fielder at mid-off"
10.2,"Paul to Yuvraj, no run","fullish and wide outside off, it's there in the slot for Yuvraj's freed-arms drive through cover point, but he fails to make contact"
10.1,"Paul to Pollard, 1 run","back of a length, angling into middle stump, tucked away through square leg"
9.6,"Axar Patel to Yuvraj, FOUR runs","this is bad bowling, on the pads and Yuvraj sweeps it square. All he had to do was beat one fielder in the circle which he does"
9.5,"Axar Patel to Yuvraj, SIX runs","wham too short and too wide outside off, Yuvraj stands still and leathers it over point for a six"
9.4,"Axar Patel to Pollard, 1 run",pushes at this outside off and Axar gets it to turn enough to take the outside edge. Dhawan runs in pursuit and pulls it in for just a single
9.3,"Axar Patel to Pollard, FOUR runs","he's showing he can pull off the delicate shots too. strays on the pads and he picks it off with finesse, getting the timing right and sending it screaming to the fine leg fence"
9.2,"Axar Patel to Yuvraj, 1 run","more luck for Yuvraj, top-edges this intended swipe across the line but it loops past the bowler and lands safe"
9.1,"Axar Patel to Yuvraj, FOUR runs","through Shikhar Dhawan's hands at short fine leg bowled into the pads from around the wicket, and he swung it towards short fine. Dhawan was there but lets it through"
8.6,"Paul to Yuvraj, 1 run","cuts it powerfully again, but this time it's more square and deep point runs to his left to field"
8.5,"Paul to Yuvraj, FOUR runs","nicely timed. This time Yuvraj stays still, and cuts this past backward point to the boundary"
8.4,"Paul to Yuvraj, no run","backs away to give himself room but smart by Keemo, who pushes it wide of off stump. Yuvraj can't reach that, and it's another dot ball"
8.3,"Paul to Yuvraj, no run","beaten by the slower ball. Back of a length and he went for the pull, but too early on it and it goes through to the keeper outside off"
8.2,"Paul to Pollard, 1 run","clobbered, but there is a long-on who takes it on one-bounce. Too full and he brings out the powerful drive again"
8.1,"Paul to Yuvraj, 1 run","back of a length outside off, he mistimes his pull to wide long-on"
8.1,"Paul to Yuvraj, 1 wide","starts with a bouncer that Yuvraj ducks under, but it's too far above his head and will be a wide"
7.6,"Tewatia to Pollard, SIX runs","that one is travelling out of here takes a big stride and just smacks it straight and true. Pollard is able to clear the ropes with almost no follow through, this one was a full swing of the bat. And it's headed waaaay over the straight boundary, clears the sightscreen too"
7.5,"Tewatia to Yuvraj, 1 run","he stays back to this one, and pushes it uppishly to the bowler's left to take a single to long-on"
7.4,"Tewatia to Yuvraj, no run","inside edged onto pad. dips nicely on Yuvraj who was coming forward to defend, and takes the inside edge onto pad"
7.3,"Tewatia to Yuvraj, no run","angled into him, fullish, he comes on the front foot and defends"
7.2,"Tewatia to Pollard, 1 run",pushes at this length ball and it takes the inside edge to square leg
7.1,"Tewatia to Pollard, FOUR runs","unreal power by Pollard tossed up around off and he merely seemd to push it, but that rocketed away to the long-off fence"
6.6,"Rabada to Yuvraj, no run","bluffed him by bringing in slip, and he digs this in back of a length to tuck him up. Yuvraj rises up and defends it back slightly awkwardly"
6.5,"Rabada to Pollard, 1 run","back of a length, gets it to bounce from outside off to just below Pollard's chest, who dabs it down on the onside and they run a quick single. 145 kph"
6.4,"Rabada to Yuvraj, 1 run","just short of yorker length on the stumps, clipped to deep square leg off his toes"
6.3,"Rabada to Pollard, 1 run","almost yorker length but the slower ball at 123 kph and Pollard is early into his push, mis-times it to mid-off. No pace on the ball allows a quick single"
6.2,"Rabada to Pollard, no run","fullish at 147.5 kph, driven to mid-off"
6.1,"Rabada to Pollard, no run","146 kph yorker, Pollard does well to dig it out to mid-on"
5.6,"Sharma to Pollard, 1 run","shimmies forward to block this towards mid-on and they decide to take the risky single. No direct hit this time, and Pollard was quick in getting across too"
5.5,"Sharma to de Kock, OUT","he's holed out to fine leg Quinton was looking like he would 'Pant' his way through this innings, but he hoicks a back of length delivery on leg stump straight to Boult, who holds a smart catch over his head. Mumbai are crumbling"
5.4,"Sharma to de Kock, no run",backs away but Ishant keeps it yorker length just outside off and de Kock can't connect with the attempted square drive
5.3,"Sharma to de Kock, FOUR runs","in the slot and dismissed. Too full, he clears his front leg a bit and has a free swing of the arms to lift it over the in-field and into the midwicket boundary"
5.2,"Sharma to de Kock, FOUR runs","bouncer and de Kock is quickly inside the line to hook it from over his head. Gets it nicely and sends it fine, to the boundary"
5.1,"Sharma to Yadav, OUT","direct hit from Shreyas Iyer at mid-off and Suryakumar is comfortably short. Brilliant moment in the field from the DC captain, who has been very good patrolling mid-off through this innings. He pushed it hard and straight to Iyer, and set off, but Iyer was onto it and had enough time to line up the stumps and let fly"
4.6,"Rabada to de Kock, no run","slower ball at 127.8 kph (that's normal pace for many). De Kock pats it in front of him, and thinks about the quick single but there is none"
4.5,"Rabada to Yadav, 1 run","back of a length, coming in from outside off. That is 150.9 kph - incredible. Flicked to fine leg"
4.4,"Rabada to de Kock, 1 run",whoa that's a 150.6 kph yorker. Quinton does well to get the bat down and keep it out
4.3,"Rabada to Yadav, 1 run","good length on the stumps, pushed off the front foot to mid-off and they take a quick single. That was 148 kph"
4.2,"Rabada to de Kock, 1 leg bye","too quick for Quinton, at 146 kph. Length ball on middle and leg, he was looking to smash it over midwicket. It thuds into pad and rolls towards gully"
4.1,"Rabada to de Kock, no run","back of a length on off, tries to swat it with a horizontal bat but ends up under-edging back to the bowler's left"
3.6,"Sharma to Yadav, no run","full again and driven more fluently that time, but still doesn't get the placement and mid-off fields"
3.5,"Sharma to Yadav, no run","too full, driven but off the toe-end to mid-off"
3.4,"Sharma to Yadav, no run","back of a length outside off, he goes to slash it and doesn't connect"
3.3,"Sharma to Rohit Sharma, OUT","caught by Tewatia at deep square leg Sharma calling Sharma. Another slower ball, better radar then. On off and cutting in, Rohit went down to slog sweep but got a top edge. Tewatia was circling under it and mis-judged it almost, but in the end half-dived forward and held on. Big wicket."
3.2,"Sharma to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","didn't get the timing quite right but got the placement spot on slower ball but strays on the pads and Rohit thought he'll tickle it fine. But a bit early into the shot, so ends up hitting in the air, but enough on it to fall over short fine leg and run away to the boundary"
3.1,"Sharma to de Kock, 1 leg bye",walked across his stump and wanted to paddle-pull it over short fine leg but only gets a thigh pad to square leg
2.6,"Boult to de Kock, 1 run","fullish on the stumps, flicked to deep square leg to retain strike"
2.5,"Boult to de Kock, FOUR runs","and those two shots have forced the error from Boult - he bowls a full toss on the pads, and it's easy picking for de Kock, who effortlessly flicks it past short fine leg for a boundary"
2.4,"Boult to de Kock, SIX runs","walloped too short and he pulls off the front foot, smashing it several rows into the midwicket stands"
2.3,"Boult to de Kock, FOUR runs",gets the placement right this time another half-volley angled into his pads and he smacks it between midwicket and mid-on
2.2,"Boult to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",on the pads again and worked to deep square leg off the front foot
2.1,"Boult to de Kock, 1 run","strays on the pads and he picks it up nicely to flick it, but there is a man at deep square leg and he has hit it straight to him. That was there to be hit anywhere, but he'll get only a single and he knows it, and is disappointed at his placement"
1.6,"Sharma to Rohit Sharma, no run","back of a length outside off, and Rohit pushes it to backward point"
1.5,"Sharma to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","outside edge goes for four would you believe it, the ball after slip has gone, Rohit drives away from his body and gets a thick outside edge that goes for four"
1.4,"Sharma to Rohit Sharma, no run","length ball on the fifth stump line, Rohit went for the drive again, but didn't move his feet. Gets the under-edge back to the bowler"
1.3,"Sharma to de Kock, 1 run","good tumbling stop by Shreyas Iyer at midwicket. too full and clipped nicely by de Kock, but Iyer ensures it's only a single"
1.2,"Sharma to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","good length, but a bit too straight and Rohit works this in front of square"
1.1,"Sharma to Rohit Sharma, no run","length ball outside off, drives at it with feet static, gets a thickish inside edge that rolls towards forward short leg"
0.6,"Boult to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full outside off and Rohit drives fluently by opening the face of the bat, but tidy work from Axar at point, intercepting to his left"
0.5,"Boult to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs",too full and Rohit leans into his push to beat mid-off. Rabada there tumbled but couldn't stop it
0.4,"Boult to Rohit Sharma, no run","similar ball, angling across with the length pulled back a tad. Rohit lets it go through"
0.3,"Boult to Rohit Sharma, no run","ooh, play and a miss. Angling across him and going away, Rohit goes for the drive, but it rushes past his outside edge"
0.2,"Boult to de Kock, 1 run",strays on the pads and tickled to deep midwicket off an almost yorker length
0.1,"Boult to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","good length angling across gently, Rohit pushes forward to pat it towards mid-off and takes the quick single"
19.6,"Bumrah to Pant, 1 run","another well-executed yorker, on middle stump, and all Pant can do is stab it back to the bowler with a straight bat. Dives left in his follow-through to stop it, can't quite keep it within his reach, and they sneak a single, but the bigger issue is Bumrah, who looks to be in a bit of pain, clutching his left chest/shoulder area. I hope this isn't anything serious. He's back on his feet, and the physio has a hand on his back as he trudges off the field"
19.5,"Bumrah to Tewatia, 1 run","in the blockhole on off stump, jabbed down to long-on"
19.4,"Bumrah to Tewatia, SIX runs","what a shot, Rahul Tewatia! Why did Delhi pick him over Mishra and Lamichhane? Perhaps this is why. Back of a length outside off, and he takes a big step back and across - before the bowler has released - and gets down on one knee to slog-sweep over the midwicket boundary"
19.3,"Bumrah to Pant, 1 leg bye","wow. Slower ball, angling into leg stump. Pant looks for the reverse-swat, with both third man and backward point inside the circle, but he's undone by lack of pace, and only manages a leg bye into the point region"
19.2,"Bumrah to Pant, SIX runs","wham. He's already hit him for one flicked six, and this time he whips this back-of-a-length ball from around an off-stump line and sends it over his favourite backward square leg boundary"
19.1,"Bumrah to Tewatia, 1 run","and he does his job perfectly. Short, rising ball in the corridor, and he jumps to ride the bounce and carve it to third man for a single"
18.6,"Rasikh Salam to Pant, FOUR runs","shortish, fourth-stump line, opens up at the hips to make a bit more room and slap it to the cover point boundary. It feels like the fielders have disappeared altogether"
18.5,"Rasikh Salam to Pant, SIX runs","bottom hand comes off the handle, but one hand will do for Pant in this form. This is a back-of-the-hand slower one, short of a good length, outside off, and he frees his arms so much that only his top hand remains on the handle, and swings cleanly with that one fully outstretched arm to send this soaring waaaay over wide long-on"
18.5,"Rasikh Salam to Pant, 1 wide","looks to go back to that slower ball wide of off stump, full, but bowls it too wide"
18.4,"Rasikh Salam to Pant, SIX runs","short, gets up to chest height while angling in from round the wicket, and Pant picks the length so early and swivels to absolutely pulverise it over backward square leg"
18.3,"Rasikh Salam to Pant, 2 runs","another slower ball, extremely slow and short outside off. Waits, waits some more, and swats it down the ground to long-on. Takes its time reaching the fielder, and they can hurry through for a second"
18.2,"Rasikh Salam to Tewatia, 1 run","in the blockhole, angling into off stump, driven to long-off"
18.1,"Rasikh Salam to Pant, 1 run","full slower ball, wide of off stump. Reaches out for a flat-bat drive to long-off. Lack of pace meant he couldn't go through the covers or squarer, smart use of the slower one"
17.6,"Bumrah to Pant, 1 run","full on middle and leg, clipped towards deep midwicket and he retains the strike, though he thought of a second, turning momentarily at the non-striker's end"
17.5,"Bumrah to Pant, FOUR runs","back of a length, at the hip, and that's another stunning shot to bring up fifty. He doesn't have a lot of room to free his arms, so he manufactures a short-arm jab, with his hip tucked in at the moment of contact, and sends the ball flying to the backward square leg boundary"
17.4,"Bumrah to Pant, no run","fullish, angling away from off stump. Mid-off was up, and perhaps that was the direction he should have been aiming. Goes for the big slog over midwicket, though, and he loses his shape and doesn't connect"
17.3,"Bumrah to Pant, SIX runs","what. A. Shot. Fullish, on middle and leg, and Pant sits back in his crease, opens up his front hip, and just flicks this, effortlessly, over the backward square leg boundary"
17.2,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, OUT","gone, well bowled. Hammers the pitch with this bouncer, and despite the angle he usually creates, exaggeratedly away from the left-hander, he manages to cramp Axar. Leans back to try and ramp it but the lack of room to free his arms means not enough power, and he hits it straight to the fielder at third man"
17.1,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, FOUR runs","super shot. Back of a length, angling away from off stump, gives him just enough width to slash it away over backward point and easily beat third man to his left"
16.6,"McClenaghan to Pant, FOUR runs","bangs it in again, gets it up near the front shoulder at high pace, and Pant somehow swivels and gets enough bat on this hook to beat fine leg haring to his left. Not the most in-control shot, but hugely effective - kind of like this innings"
16.5,"McClenaghan to Paul, OUT","typical McClenaghan wicket. Bouncer, hits the pitch hard and gets the ball up above the right shoulder of the batsman. He's working against that height and the angle away from him, and all he manages is a top edge that balloons high before settling in Quinton de Kock's gloves"
16.4,"McClenaghan to Pant, 1 run","low full-toss on off stump, takes the bottom hand off the handle to whip this round to deep square leg"
16.3,"McClenaghan to Pant, FOUR runs","full-toss, around thigh-high, angling away from off stump, and Pant makes a bit of extra room to swat this away over wide mid-off"
16.2,"McClenaghan to Paul, 1 run","short, angling across into a fifth-stump line, pulled to wide long-on"
16.1,"McClenaghan to Paul, 2 runs","Shot. Short, on leg stump or thereabouts, and he makes room to slap it away to the right of sweper cover"
15.6,"Pandya to Pant, SIX runs","short again, but this time it's outside off, on around a fifth-stump line. This might be deliberate from Hardik, to try and get him to miscue the pull. Pant goes for it, uses his bottom hand to control it as much as possible while meeting it at shoulder height and dragging it from outside off stump. Still makes a good enough connection for it to carry all the way over the midwicket boundary"
15.5,"Pandya to Pant, FOUR runs","length ball now, on off stump, and Pant clears his front leg a little to flat-bat this over wide mid-off. Big backlift, big follow-through"
15.4,"Pandya to Pant, SIX runs","bang, another biggie over square leg. I don't know why they're trying to test him with the short ball. Angling in from round the wicket, gets up to around chest height, and he's on the front foot to hoick it around powerfully"
15.3,"Pandya to Paul, 1 leg bye","back of a length, angling into leg stump. Looks to flick and only manages a bit of thigh pad into the leg side. Too much bounce for a serious lbw appeal"
15.2,"Pandya to Paul, no run","shortish, extra bounce and the inward angle cramp him for room as he goes onto the back foot. Tries to hurriedly work it into the leg side but the ball climbs and hits him on the thigh pad"
15.2,"Pandya to Paul, 1 wide","greets him with a bouncer, but it slides a long way down the leg side, past the attempted pull"
15.1,"Pandya to S Dhawan, OUT","picks out deep midwicket went for the flat-batted pull, but there wasn't much pace on it, the off-cutter from Hardik and he doesn't get the distance on it. Straight to Suryakumar at deep midwicket. Dhawan knew he had to get on with it, hence the shot, but he's gone now."
14.6,"Cutting to Pant, SIX runs",smashed too short and he read the length quickly. This one didn't bounce as much and he could rock back to pull it over square leg
14.5,"Cutting to Pant, FOUR runs","bouncer, rose up sharply, and takes his glove to go over the keeper's head for four. He was trying to hook it, but it bounced surprisingly high"
14.4,"Cutting to S Dhawan, 1 run","stump to stump line on a good length, patted to the bowler's right but they can't take the quick single"
14.3,"Cutting to Pant, 1 run","reverse sweep to deep point. Length ball on leg stump, he might have been better off trying to go over the legside, but he had decided to reverse hit it"
14.2,"Cutting to Pant, FOUR runs","incredible shot walking across his stumps and he picks it up from his pads even as he's falling over, to flick it to fine leg. Lands about 5 cms away from the ropes, so it's only a four"

13.1,"Pandya to Pant, no run","ooh beaten outside off. on a length and it holds its line, he stayed inside the line and had a poke at it"
12.6,"Cutting to Ingram, OUT","picks out Hardik at deep midwicket picked it up from wide of off stump and wanted to send it several rows back, but there's no pace on the ball and he ends up getting height but not the distance. Hardik back-pedals and takes it, and is careful to not step over the boundary rope"
12.5,"Cutting to S Dhawan, 1 run","too short and he rocks back to pull, but there is a deep square leg"
12.4,"Cutting to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","beautiful angled across him, pitches on off and moving away, and he waits for it and glides it past backward point. Such great timing on that, no fielder had a chance of stopping it"
12.3,"Cutting to Ingram, 1 run","good length on the stumps, he goes deep in his crease and slaps it from in front of the stumps to deep extra cover"
12.2,"Cutting to Ingram, FOUR runs","what a shot moves across his stumps and knew that short fine leg was up, so he paddle-scooped it over the man and into the fence"
12.1,"Cutting to Ingram, no run","good length outside off at 120 kph, he waits for it to cut it fine, but it's too fine, and the keeper is able to stop it on the bounce"
11.6,"Bumrah to Ingram, 1 run","overthrow goes for the yorker, ends up as a low full toss, punched forcefully to extra cover. They are not seriously thinking of the single but the fielder has a shy at the stumps, and no one's backing up, so they get a run"
11.5,"Bumrah to Ingram, no run","that was a quick one, ends up as a full toss outside off but at 144 kph. Ingram beaten for pace, trying to force it through the offside"

9.3,"McClenaghan to Ingram, 1 run","brilliant stop by Pollard at long-on too short again outside off, he goes back and pulls it fiercely to long-on. Pollard runs to his right, dives and picks up the ball"
9.2,"McClenaghan to S Dhawan, 1 run","just short of Yuvraj at midwicket tailing into him, and he chips it in the air, but it's dipping on Yuvraj who can't reach it despite diving forward"
9.1,"McClenaghan to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","throws his bat this one, short and wide outside off and it takes the toe end of the bat to run down fine to third man for a boundary. Perhaps not in control of it exactly, but that was a poor ball"

6.6,"Rasikh Salam to S Dhawan, 2 runs","slower ball, dances down the track to meet it on the half-volley and drives fluently through extra cover for a couple. Long-off runs around to field it"
6.5,"Rasikh Salam to Ingram, 1 run","back of a length again, sticking to the channel outside off and not giving batsmen room. Ingram chops it into the offside for a quick single"
6.4,"Rasikh Salam to Ingram, no run","slightly fuller, but not full enough to drive comfortably. Ingram gets on the front foot to drive it, but can only get it off the toe-end, back to the bowler"

3.5,"McClenaghan to Ingram, no run","back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
3.4,"McClenaghan to Iyer, OUT","fullish on off stump, and Iyer's cameo ends courtesy an excellent catch from Kieron Pollard at extra-cover. Looks for another lofted drive, but doesn't get the elevation this time, and doesn't get it far enough wide of Pollard. He throws himself to his right, and grabs it one-handed at about shoulder height"
3.3,"McClenaghan to Iyer, SIX runs","full, lots of room outside off, and Iyer frees his arms to play another super shot, a lofted drive hit so crisply over mid-off that it carries all the way"
3.2,"McClenaghan to Iyer, no run","length ball, a bit of swing back in towards middle stump. Stays leg-side of the ball to dab towards point"
3.1,"McClenaghan to S Dhawan, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, opens his bat face for the dabbed single to backward point"
2.6,"Rasikh Salam to Iyer, FOUR runs","shot! Looks for the wide yorker, and he doesn't execute it too badly, but Iyer is leaning back, waiting for it, and he opens his bat face to steer it to the right of short third man. He's looking in great touch today"
2.6,"Rasikh Salam to S Dhawan, (no ball) 1 run","back of a length on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball to dab gently towards point"
2.5,"Rasikh Salam to S Dhawan, no run","length ball outside off, looks for the flat-bat cover drive but plays too early, hits it back towards the bowler instead"
2.4,"Rasikh Salam to Iyer, 1 run","a touch short outside off, a bit of inward movement to cramp Iyer on the cut. Chops it down into the ground behind him, and de Kock, diving right, gets a hand on it - glove off - but can't stop it completey"
2.3,"Rasikh Salam to Iyer, FOUR runs","fuller, too much width, and Iyer gets on the front foot to loft this over the covers"
2.2,"Rasikh Salam to Iyer, no run","lovely shot. Iyer really doesn't need too much room to cut, and it doesn't need to be too short either. Cuts off the front foot, and Hardik moves quickly to his right, anticipating well, to cut it off"

1.4,"McClenaghan to Iyer, no run","length ball on middle and leg, clipped to square leg"
1.3,"McClenaghan to Shaw, OUT","excellent response, the line goes a bit wider and the length fuller but well short of a driving length, especially on this bouncy surface. Shaw has been eager to drive on the up today, but he stays a little leg-side of the ball at all times, and early in his innings that can make him play inside the line, especially when the ball is angling away from him. He does so here, and gets a thin edge through to de Kock"
1.2,"McClenaghan to Shaw, FOUR runs","only a touch short now, on off stump or thereabouts, but it's short enough for Shaw, who picks the length early and plays the front-foot pull, wide of mid-on"

0.3,"Rasikh Salam to S Dhawan, no run","ooh, beauty. Swing from over the wicket, across the left-hander, and excellent carry. Hits a length that catches Dhawan half-forward in defence, and the ball zips past his outside edge"
0.2,"Rasikh Salam to Shaw, 1 run","shortish, a bit of late inswing to cramp Shaw and he pulls along the ground to deep square leg"
0.1,"Rasikh Salam to S Dhawan, 1 run","short on off stump, pulled high in the air, and down the throat of deep square leg, moving to his right. No wicket, of course"
0.1,"Rasikh Salam to Shaw, (no ball) 1 run","fullish, a bit of inswing towards a fourth-stump line, punched crisply into the covers"
19.4,"Shakib to Gill, SIX runs","Shubman wins it with a six What a remarkable chase by KKR. Incredible scenes at Eden. Down the track again, takes it on the full and send sit into the sightscreen. Eden goes ballistic"

19.2,"Shakib to Gill, SIX runs","Shubman's around too, he reminds us down the track, reaches the pitch of the ball and lofts it well over long-on. Beautiful use of the feet, beautiful, clean strike"
19.1,"Shakib to Russell, 1 run",almighty heave but only gets an under-edge to deep square leg
19.1,"Shakib to Russell, 1 wide",Russell stays put and Shakib second guesses him by firing it down leg. That will be a wide
18.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Russell, 1 run","powerfully struck again, but there is a sweeper cover so only a single. Again, it means Russell is on strike"
18.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Russell, SIX runs","oh my this should be illegal that's a mis-hit. A total mis-hit. And it's gone over the extra cover boundary. How does he do it? Bhuvi kept it wide outside off, and Russell moved slightly across, was almost falling over but clubbed it off the toe-end of the bat. And still sent it over the fence"
18.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Russell, no run","rare dot ball, goes wide outside off, and Russell was backing away again so doesn't connect with the swing"
18.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Russell, FOUR runs","incredible this was a yorker that was perhaps off by just millimetres, but Russell power-drives it by going deep in his crease from leg stump to long-off. Mid-off's despairing dive not enough"
18.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Russell, SIX runs",that's got some air miles on it! Russell is turning the heat on. clears his front leg and lifts this full delivery from leg stump so high over midwicket it might need a visa. Way into the crowd
18.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Russell, FOUR runs","Russell's power is something full ball on leg stump, and he gets his leg out of the way to power it through midwicket for a four"
17.6,"Kaul to Russell, 1 run","full toss outside off and Russell wanted to belt the cover off the ball, but he mistimes it, and sends it to Warner at long-off, who is quick to relay the ball back. But Russel's kept strike for the next over"

17.3,"Kaul to Russell, 1 run","that was hit incredibly hard but straight to the man at deep midwicket. Length ball outside off and he swiped it with power, but went flat and one bounce to the fielder"
17.2,"Kaul to Russell, SIX runs","take that He's coming to the party late, but how. Low full toss now and he muscles it over the bowler's head. Bottom of the bat, but such is his power that he sends it over the rope"
17.1,"Kaul to Russell, SIX runs","boom too full, half-volley on leg stump and Russell clears his leg and swings through the line to send it soaring over deep midwicket"
16.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Russell, 1 run","fantastic bowling yet another yorker, and all Russell can do is jab his bat down to dig it out. Jammed into the ground hard enough that it bounces over Bhuvneshwar and they get a single"
16.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, 1 run","another pinpoint yorker, and Gill clips it off his toes to short fine leg. Brilliant bowling"
16.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Russell, 1 run","smart bowling, keeps it very wide outside off and just inside the tramline, has Russell reaching for it and he can only chop it away into the offside for a single"
16.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, 1 run","length ball outside off, cut to deep point to get Russell back on strike"
16.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, 2 runs","lovely cover drive, leaned into it beautifully. Cover gets a hand to it, so it gives enough time for extra cover on the fence to run around and field"
16.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, no run","pinpoint yorker on off stump, and he can't do much except pat it back to the bowler"
15.6,"Rashid Khan to Russell, FOUR runs","one bounce into the extra cover fence! Russell sends Rashid's last ball to the boundary, clubbing it from outside off over the in-field. There's life in this game yet perhaps"

15.4,"Rashid Khan to Gill, no run","slider outside off, chopped tentatively into the offside"
15.3,"Rashid Khan to Rana, OUT","strikes first ball after the break lights out at Eden, now lights out for KKR? This was the leg-break, pitched on middle and spun in just enough to beat his attempted drive back with a straight bat, strikes him on the pad. Loud appeal and the finger goes up. Rana doesn't review, walks off"
15.2,"Rashid Khan to Rana, no run",went for the conventional sweep but misses and is struck on the pads. Outside off
15.1,"Rashid Khan to Rana, FOUR runs","pre-meditated reverse sweep for four to square third man. Unbelievable shot, and nailed it to perfection"
14.6,"Sandeep to Russell, no run",beautifully bowled. Pinpoint yorker that Russell can only jab down to keep it from going onto the stumps
14.5,"Sandeep to Rana, 1 run","another full toss, on middle stump this time and lower, he gives himself room and carves it away to deep point."
14.4,"Sandeep to Rana, SIX runs","clobbered this time Sandeep doesn't get away with a full toss, this was outside off and Rana had the room to free his arms and unleash a baseball swing, sending it high over long-off"
14.3,"Sandeep to Russell, 1 run","big swipe across the line but doesn't get the timing right, sends it to deep midwicket along the ground off the inside half of the bat"

14.1,"Sandeep to Rana, no run","loses control of the slower ball a bit, but ends up working to his advantage. Loopy fulltoss well wide of off, just inside the tram line. He stretches for it and sends it to mid-off"

13.2,"Rashid Khan to Rana, FOUR runs","shot given room outside off, this is flatter but on the sixth stump line and he transfers eight back and cuts it powerfully past point"
13.1,"Rashid Khan to Rana, no run","goes down for a slog sweep to one pitched on middle and spinning into him and misses. Rashid goes up for an appeal, but that is surely missing leg. He had given himself room and wanted to slog-sweep from leg stump. Oh wait, they have gone for a review. This is a bad move, I suspect. And it pitched outside leg too. KKR had a terrible review when they bowled, now SRH have returned the favour."
12.6,"Sandeep to Rana, 1 run",full outside off and driven fluently by opening the face of the bat to deep point. Sixth IPL fifty for Nitish Rana

12.4,"Sandeep to Karthik, OUT","chipped straight to cover slower ball and it seemed to hold up on the pitch a bit. Full outside off, Karthik was way too early into the drive and ends up chipping it straight in the air. Dolly  of a catch to Bhuvneshwar"
12.3,"Sandeep to Karthik, 2 runs","pulled in front of square, and Vijay Shankar runs around from deep square leg to deep midwicket to field the ball and fire in a throw, but they manage to take two"
12.2,"Sandeep to Rana, 1 run","goes over cover this time, inside out. Slower ball by Sandeep, and he doesn't pick it up perfectly, but gets a goodish chunk on it to go over the infield"
12.2,"Sandeep to Rana, 1 wide","and he goes around the wicket to angle it in, but goes too far down leg. Pressure telling on Sandeep"
12.1,"Sandeep to Rana, FOUR runs","nails the sweep beautifully saw it in the slot, went down on one knee and slog swept it to the square leg fence, flat and fast"
11.6,"Kaul to Karthik, no run","play and a miss great ball. Angled in and moving away a touch, Karthik wanted to drive it, ends up not connecting, and it just missed the outside edge"
11.5,"Kaul to Karthik, no run","full on the stumps, blocked back to the bowler"

9.5,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, no run",nearly chopped on! Didn't read the googly as he looked to dab past short third man. Bounced over the stumps

1.6,"Shakib to Lynn, OUT","looked to wallop across the line on the pull but this one skids through to keep low, lobs off the toe-end of Lynn's bat and the cover fielder takes an absolute dolly. Superb bowling, this was the arm-ball from Shakib at 95kph. Rashid can't ask for an easier catch"

19.1,"Ferguson to Pandey, 1 run","good length outside off, slower than normal pace, stroked through cover"
18.6,"Prasidh to Shankar, FOUR runs",cleverly placed fine leg was in the circle and this one was tailing in too. He manages to get enough on it to place it beyond the fielder in the circle and to the fine leg boundary.
18.5,"Prasidh to Shankar, no run","lbw appeal given and the batsman has reviewed it That tailed into the batsman late, he wanted to flick it away but the movement defeats his bat and hits the outside half of his front pad. Was that going down leg? That's the only question. Hit on the full, so that will be advantageous to the bowler. Even if it clips, he'll be out. No bat on it, but it's missing leg stump! So Vijay stays on. Good review"
18.4,"Prasidh to Shankar, no run","good comeback, wide yorker outside off at normal pace. He doesn't connect"
18.3,"Prasidh to Shankar, SIX runs","picked up the slower one he dismisses it, having read it perfectly. Cleared his leg, saw it was a slower one,  and heaved it over midwicket, putting a lot of body into the shot"

17.2,"Russell to Shankar, 1 run","back of a length, slowed it up a bit, Vijay clubs it off the back foot but straight to long-on. He's admonishing himself, wanted to place it better"

15.6,"Russell to Warner, OUT","brilliant catch by Uthappa at cover this was too full, and Warner drove it powerfully from his crease. That looked headed for the fence but Uthappa tumbled to his left to pluck the ball just inches from the ground. End of a fabulous innings, who would have ever thought he's been away?"
15.5,"Russell to Shankar, 1 run","yorker on the stumps, pushed to extra cover for a quick single"
15.4,"Russell to Warner, 1 run",driven to cover
15.3,"Russell to Warner, SIX runs","that is some power by Warner it was a slower ball, so he had to manufacture the pace himself. Backed away and just clubbed this back of length ball back over Russell's head and into the sightscreen. hit with a horizontal bat"

11.4,"Ferguson to Warner, 1 run","quick one back of a length down leg, so quick that Dinesh Karthik can't gather it cleanly. No signal from the umpire when they took a single, so maybe a bit of glove on that. Yes there was, so that is a drop by Karthik! Costly one"

7.2,"Ali to Raina, FOUR runs","down the track and into the straight boundary. Raina has had enough of jabbing and pushing, he dances down the track, gets to the pitch of the ball and hits it straight back over Moeen's head an dinto the boundary"

1.3,"Saini to Watson, no run","pings him on the helmet that's a snorter of a bouncer, rises up sharply and hits Watson on the front of the helmet, while he was trying ot pull. Too quickly onto him, on a pitch that's slow - that is impressive bowling"

7.6,"Harbhajan to Hetmyer, OUT","oh what have you done Shimron Hetmyer? This was given some more air, Hetmyer came on the front foot and pushed to Raina at cover. For some unfathomable reason, he thought there was a run there and was halfway down the pitch. Raina reached the ball by then and flicked it to Dhoni. Hetmyer gave up the ghost and just stood there, watching the bails get whipped off."
7.5,"Harbhajan to Hetmyer, no run","flatter, into leg stump, he moves back and slaps to mid-on"
7.4,"Harbhajan to Patel, 1 leg bye","strays on the pads and the ball rolls away very close towards backward square leg. RCB's thinking is so muddled they went for that run. Dhoni had run to field the ball and had he hit the stumps, Hetmyer would have been out. But he doesn't hit"
7.3,"Harbhajan to Patel, no run",backs away and drives this fuller length ball to cover
7.2,"Harbhajan to AB, OUT","you cannot deny Harbhajan today AB tries to sweep again, but doesn't get hold of it once again. The pitch is not one where you can rely on the ball coming on even a bit, and AB is too early, the top edge flies to midwicket this time. And Jadeja is the man there, he isn't going to drop any. even when he has to run in and dive forward. RCB in tatters"
7.1,"Harbhajan to AB, 2 runs","Tahir has dropped AB at deep square leg That would have been nail in coffin with Undertaker's music playing, but AB gets a life. Swept from leg-stump, gets a top edge, and Tahir makes a hash of it"
6.6,"Chahar to AB, 1 run","back of a length again outside off, but AB has watched and knows the ball holds up. Waits for it and slaps it down to third man gently. Superb from Chahar at the top, just 17 runs in four overs. And would have been 13, if not for a mis-fielded boundary in the first over"
6.5,"Chahar to AB, no run","down the track and gets to the pitch of the ball to drive powerfully, but straight to Bravo at mid-off, so no run for AB"
6.4,"Chahar to AB, no run",good length patted into the offside
6.3,"Chahar to AB, no run","through him length ball nipping back in off the seam, and through between AB's bat and body. He was trying to nudge it into the onside"
6.2,"Chahar to Patel, 1 run","ooh was that a potential catch for Tahir at deep square leg? drags it a bit short, Parthiv pulls but in the air. Tahir decides against running in to dive, and collects on the bounce"

5.6,"Harbhajan to Patel, no run","inside edge onto pad and rolls to slip. Harbhajan is up in appeal, but the edge saved him. Length ball on off, he wanted to cut it, but edged onto pad"

5.3,"Harbhajan to AB, 2 runs","length ball on the stumps spinning onto pad, flicked off the front foot"
5.2,"Harbhajan to Ali, OUT","popped back to the bowler tames of dismissals. This one was on the length from where the ball is holding up. It held up even more, pitched on off and spinning away, and Moeen was way too early into his shot, trying to drive. Ends up popping the ball in the air off the end of the bat, and Harbhajan has all the time in the world to pluck the catch over his head. What a start by Harbhajan and Chennai"
5.1,"Harbhajan to Ali, no run","good length, pitching on off, spinning away, defended into the offside"
4.6,"Chahar to Ali, 1 run","back of a length on the stumps, Moeen changes tack. He was trying to pull these earlier, but he's content to glide it to third man now. Gliding, nudging and pushing might be the way to go on this pitch, till you get set"
4.5,"Chahar to Patel, 1 run","upper cut surprises him wit hthe bouncer, but Parthiv adjusts well to upper cut it over Dhoni. Harbhajan is at third man and collects on the bounce"
4.4,"Chahar to Ali, 1 run","back of a length on off again, under-edges the pull to deep square leg"
4.3,"Chahar to Patel, 1 run","he's honed in on that back of length spot again, and the ball's holding up. Parthiv tries to flick it away but a bit early into the shot."
4.2,"Chahar to Ali, 1 run","dragged it down a little short, but Moeen doesn't try to pull very fiercely, almost guides it to the man on the square leg boundary, along the ground"
4.1,"Chahar to Patel, 1 run","back of a length on off stump, he mis-times the pull towards deep square leg"
3.6,"Harbhajan to Ali, SIX runs","boom takes an offspinner to read an offspinner! This was fuller, in the sweeping range and Moeen was quickly down on one knee and hit it out of the screws. Superb connection to send the ball into the midwicket stands. Much needed hit for RCB"
3.5,"Harbhajan to Ali, no run","fuller, driven towards point with an open bat face"
3.4,"Harbhajan to Ali, no run","beauty to start with. Moeen will appreciate that. On a length outside off, drawing him forward and spinning past"
3.3,"Harbhajan to Kohli, OUT","he's got him! Harbhajan hadn't got a wicket in the last three T20s he played in. What a time and what a wicket to break that duck. Dragged this a little shorter, but it was still spinning into Kohli, who transferred weight back and pulled fiercely. But the ball's not really coming on to the bat, so even though he connected well, he didn't get the distance, and Ravindra Jadeja at deep midwicket stayed still and caught the ball, calm as you please. Chepauk's gone ballistic"
3.2,"Harbhajan to Patel, 1 run","ooh the ball's already turning. pitches on a length outside off and holds up, Parthiv ends up getting it off the top half of the bat down to long of with a horizontal bat"
3.1,"Harbhajan to Patel, no run",good length on off and spinning away. Parthiv wanted to slash it away but under-edges it back to the bowler
2.6,"Chahar to Kohli, no run",brilliant bowling. yorker angling in from slightly wider of the crease to finish and all Kohli can do is dig it back out. Terrific from Chahar
2.6,"Chahar to Kohli, (no ball)","slower one goes wrong it's slipped out of his hands and gone over Kohli's head, so it's a no-ball. Free hit coming up."
2.5,"Chahar to Kohli, no run","back of a length outside off again, and Kohli is again not able to hit freely through the line or on the up. Driven to mid-off"
2.4,"Chahar to Kohli, no run","terrific bowling, he's found that spot from where the ball is holding up a bit, and Kohli is a mite early into his shot. ends up patting it back"
2.3,"Chahar to Kohli, no run","good ball, back of a length and on off stump, steered to point, but Jadeja's there and they aren't going to risk a quick single to him."
2.2,"Chahar to Kohli, no run","swing and a miss this pitch is not conducive to strokeplay perhaps. It held up a bit, length outside off. Kohli wanted to slap through cover, but couldn't connect"
2.1,"Chahar to Kohli, 2 runs","back of a length keeps it stump to stump, and the ball doesn't bounce above the knee roll, Kohli comes on the front foot and flicks to deep square leg. The man has to run to his left so they get a couple"
1.6,"Harbhajan to Kohli, 1 run","flatter on off and spinning in a bit, Kohli moves back and across and wrists it to midwicket"
1.5,"Harbhajan to Patel, 1 leg bye","tossed up but on the pads, rolls away to square leg"
1.4,"Harbhajan to Patel, 2 runs",too short and gets it to bounce so Parthiv can move on the backfoot and cut it fiercely. Too fierce for the man at point to dive and intercept cleanly
1.3,"Harbhajan to Kohli, 1 run","fullish on the stumps, Kohli drives gently to a widish long-on"

0.3,"Chahar to Patel, no run","good bowling, keeps it wide of off stump but within the tramlines, Parthiv lets it go, but that's not a wide"
0.2,"Chahar to Patel, no run","back of a length ball, given some width outside off. Parthiv slashes hard but can't get past point"

18.3,"Nortje to Pandya, OUT","taken at midwicket. Short ball, rolls the fingers on it outside off. At his throat, and he's taken his eyes off it as he looks for the hook. Slices gently for Rahane who takes a few steps to his right to hold on"

18.1,"Nortje to Pandya, 1 run","short of a length at middle stump, punched aerially off the back foot to long-on's left"

16.2,"Nortje to Rohit Sharma, OUT","oh a sensational catch in the outfield. Delhi's Lalit Yadav has plucked one at deep midwicket. It's a slower short ball outside off, he plays the pull to a ball that's continuously getting big on him. Drags it over midwicket. Lalit is at a straight deep square leg position and runs to his left as this is about to dip and plop into the floor. Puts in a full length dive low to his left, slides gracefully along his two elbows and holds on to that. A standing ovation for Mumbai's captain as he goes back into the dugout. He's put them on the brink"

14.4,"Stoinis to Ishan, SIX runs","pumps it over the long-off boundary! Wow. Incredible how sweetly he hits these despite what appears a short reach. This is lobbed up like an offbreak, wide outside off. He gets low on the front foot, reaches out and absolutely crunches this from that base"

14.2,"Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, no run","full slower ball, wide outside off. Mistimed drive to extra cover"

12.5,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","good length, a carrom ball at off stump. Waits on that and clips to deep midwicket's left"
12.4,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","oh too easy. Short and wide outside off, hangs back in the crease and cuts that to cover point's left. Boundaries from his last three deliveries"

10.5,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, OUT","Suryakumar has sacrificed his wicket. Length ball outside off, punched to extra cover's right off the back foot. Rohit's taken off for the run. SKY is ball-watching. Rohit's made it to the other end as the throw comes in on the bounce to the keeper. Suryakumar leaves the crease and Rohit is on his haunches and distraught. It was Rohit's call, SKY doesn't respond to it. But he's made the decision to let the better set batsman take Mumbai through"

10.3,"Ashwin to Yadav, 1 run","length at middle, punched to long-on off the back foot"

8.6,"Dubey to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short of a length at the stumps, onto the back foot to clip this to deep square"
8.5,"Dubey to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","sent over long-on with the angle. With the turn, in fact. He's picked the googly. It's full and turning into middle stump. Has the reach to get to that and then a satisfying swing to hit that high and far enough"
8.4,"Dubey to Rohit Sharma, no run",good length and sliding on at middle stump. Defended on the front foot
8.3,"Dubey to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs",pumped over long-off. Strays a little too full. Rohit gets the front leg out and down the pitch. Keeps some swinging room and drills it straight

6.1,"Dubey to Yadav, 1 run","full at off stump, looks to drive through cover. It slides along to long-on off the inside half"
5.6,"Axar Patel to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punched uppishly to long-off"
5.5,"Axar Patel to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short of a length at middle stump, nudged to midwicket's right off the back foot"

4.5,"Stoinis to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, punched to mid-off on the up"
4.4,"Stoinis to Yadav, no run","good length and just outside off, defended into the covers"
4.3,"Stoinis to Yadav, SIX runs",casually lofted over the fine leg boundary. Short and at middle stump. Shuffles a touch and gets inside the line. Waits on it and guides that with the pace. First tier too
4.2,"Stoinis to Yadav, FOUR runs","back to business for Mumbai. Short and wide outside off, weight quickly onto the front foot and slapped to cover's right"
4.1,"Stoinis to de Kock, OUT","taken behind! Stoinis, golden duck earlier today, gets a wicket off his first ball. Short of a length, cross seam, in the corridor. Wants to cut behind square and is cramped on it a touch. Gets a thick edge to Pant's left and it is held. Stoinis is punching just about anything he can find - the air, his own palm. Get out of the way. He is pumped"
3.6,"Nortje to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","the trademark pull. Top drawer and into the first tier. Similar sort of delivery that he had been defending earlier in the over. It's a matter of inches. This is a touch wider of the corridor and that's enough. Onto the front foot, a clean pick up with an angled bat coming from under it. Regal, regal stuff"
3.5,"Nortje to Rohit Sharma, no run","good length and just outside off, feet rooted as he looks to squeeze this through the infield on the off side. Comes off the inside part of the bat and ends up at mid-on"
3.4,"Nortje to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs",swiped with the pace and angle to long leg. They'll check if that's hit the padding on the full. This is short of a length and onto his thigh. Stands tall and rotates the upper body to help this along. Fine leg is inside. It's hit the padding on the bounce
3.3,"Nortje to Rohit Sharma, no run","short of a length and in at off stump, 149kph. Defended back to the bowler"
3.2,"Nortje to Rohit Sharma, no run",short of a length and into the corridor. Defended down the pitch

2.6,"Ashwin to de Kock, FOUR runs","pulled over midwicket. Short of a length and into middle stump, just enough room for him to go with the angle and lift this pull from deep in the crease"
2.5,"Ashwin to de Kock, no run",good length and sliding onto off stump. Chopped to first slip's left
2.4,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short of a length outside off, shuffles and flicks to deep midwicket"

2.1,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, gets deep in the crease and clips to deep square off the back foot"
1.6,"Rabada to de Kock, FOUR runs","slashed over point this time. Good length and wide outside off, reaches out at that and manages to get the low part of the bat on it. A lofted square drive that no one can cut off"
1.5,"Rabada to de Kock, SIX runs","connects on one at last! A lot of leg-side swinging later, QDK has nailed one over midwicket. It's picked up from outside off. A length ball and a sweet, sweet swing across the line"
1.4,"Rabada to de Kock, no run",good length and shaped into the pads. Looks for the slog and is struck on the thigh again
1.3,"Rabada to de Kock, 4 leg byes","floats past the keeper. Short of a length and into the pads. Beaten on the attempted swipe behind square, but that's off the thigh guard and between keeper and short fine"
1.2,"Rabada to de Kock, FOUR runs","short of a length and just outside off. Arches on that a touch after getting on the front foot, then slaps that over extra cover"
1.1,"Rabada to de Kock, no run","good length and just outside off. Looks for big slog, mistimed out to a wide mid-on"
0.6,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","short of a length and into leg stump, clipped to deep square off the back foot"
0.5,"Ashwin to de Kock, no run",good length and sliding onto middle stump. Defended down the pitch
0.4,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","good length on middle stump, flicked down to long-on with the turn"
0.3,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs",just clears long-on. Good length and dipping on him quickly outside off. Shuffles and not to the pitch of this. Ends up dragging it with the turn and long-on's dived backwards and to his left but that was beyond him
0.2,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, no run","tossed up outside off, leans in and clips to midwicket with the turn"
0.1,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, no run","good length outside off, blocked on the front foot"
19.6,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, 1 run, OUT",run out at the non-striker's end. Full and into off stump. Shuffles and looks for the flick .Leading edge trickles out to long-off's right and Rabada calls for the sacrifical second. Doesn't make it
19.5,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, SIX runs","gets this one away. Slower short ball outside off, waits on it deep in the crease this timeand slaps it on the rise, flat and to deep midwicket's left"
19.4,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, no run","slower short ball outside off, looks to power that off the back foot over deep midwicket but is beaten by the variation"
19.3,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, no run","yorker at off stump, clears the front leg and slices it straight to backward point"
19.2,"Coulter-Nile to Axar Patel, OUT",dragged straight to deep midwicket. Slower short ball outside off. Nothing on that for the pull. Axar invited to make all the power on his shot and he can only hit it to Anukul who is a few yards inside
19.1,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, 1 run",slower short ball outisde off. Shuffles and drags a laboured pull down to long-on
18.6,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, no run","another full toss at the stumps, backs away for the drive and can only get it as far as extra cover"
18.5,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, 2 runs","low full toss on middle stump, punched to long-on's left"
18.4,"Bumrah to Iyer, 1 leg bye",big appeal for lbw. Mumbai review it. He's looking to whip a length ball over square leg from outside off. It's a slower one and he's shuffles a long way for this. No bat on it. On-field umpire reckons that's hit him outside off and it stays umpire's call on that.
18.3,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, 1 run","low full toss at off stump, can only pat that down to long-on"
18.2,"Bumrah to Iyer, 1 run","yorekr at middle stump, shuffles and flicks out to deep square"
18.1,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, 1 run","low full toss on middle stump, driven to long-on's right"
17.6,"Boult to Axar Patel, 1 run","short of a length at middle stump, steps out and has no room for the pull. Drags it down to long-on"
17.5,"Boult to Axar Patel, no run",short of a length and cramped at the body. Hurriedly pushed down the pitch
17.4,"Boult to Axar Patel, FOUR runs",slashed wide of third man. Short and wide outside off. Stays tall on this and gives it a big whip. NCN is back at third man this time and his slide to the left isn't enough
17.3,"Boult to Axar Patel, no run","good length and in at off stump, defended down the pitch"
17.2,"Boult to Hetmyer, OUT",steered straight to short third. It was a slower short one outside off. He shapes to give that a spank. Is forced to rethink that and try to stab over short third man. There's just no pace on it for him to manage that. Simple catch for the fielder
17.1,"Boult to Iyer, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, pulled to deep midwicket on the bounce"
16.6,"Bumrah to Iyer, 1 run","low full toss on off stump, punched straight to mid-off"
16.5,"Bumrah to Iyer, FOUR runs","slashed over point. Slower ball, short of a length and rising in at the body. Shuffles into the leg side for the room and deliberately chops this over that fielder"
16.4,"Bumrah to Iyer, 2 runs","short of a length outside off, shuffles and jabs that to third man's right to bring up his fifty. Important knock from Delhi's captain. He's seen them through some turbulence and set them up for a big flourish"
16.3,"Bumrah to Iyer, no run","slower ball, short of a length and into off stump. Looks to slide that down to third man but gets it to the keeper"
16.2,"Bumrah to Iyer, no run","good length and into middle stump, clipped to midwicket's right"
16.1,"Bumrah to Iyer, FOUR runs",hurriedly slashed wide of mid-off. Short of a length outside off. Almost looked like he was shaping for the cut but had to adjust because it came on slowly. Slaps it to mid-off's left
15.6,"Yadav to Hetmyer, FOUR runs","oh sweet! Marginally full from Yadav, at off stump. Gets to the pitch of that and goes inside-out with the turn, a chip to long-off's right"
15.5,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run","full and just outside off, drilled firmly to long-off's left"
15.4,"Yadav to Hetmyer, 1 run","short of a length and into leg stump, nudged through midwicket off the back foot"
15.3,"Yadav to Hetmyer, no run",big turn and beaten again. Short of a length and gripping and turning and rising as Hetmyer goes on the back foot this time and swishes hurriedly
15.2,"Yadav to Hetmyer, no run","turns past the outside edge. Yadav around the wicket, lands it on a length outside off and turns it big as Hetmyer looks to defend"
15.1,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
14.6,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, OUT","guided straight to fine leg. The only explanation I can think of is that Pant has probably not seen the field change, but that sounds implausible for a batsman in the IPL. It's a slower short ball up at his ribs. He swivels and hooks uppishly, and deliberately. That's four if short fine is in. It's a simple catch when he's back. Mumbai have the breakthrough they desperately wanted"
14.5,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, no run","flat-batted straight to mid-off. Short of a length outside off, steps out and is cramped on the room by this short of a length delivery"
14.4,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, FOUR runs","top edge over the keeper. Goes regular pace for this one. Short and into Pant's left shoulder. He's woefully late on the attempted hook, but he has four"
14.3,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, FOUR runs","gets it over short fine this time and brings up fifty. His first of the season. Rishabh Pant bursts into life in the final. A slower length ball from NCN, around the wicket and slanted in at middle and leg. Waits on that, gets on his back knee and ramps it"
14.2,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, no run","looks to nudge that cheekily past short fine. But he finds the fielder. Length ball at middle stump, uses the angle of NCN from around the wicket and has a short-arm whip at this from middle stump"
14.2,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, 1 wide","short and down leg side, lets that one go"
14.1,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, 1 run",good length and into middle stump. Stays tall and punches to long-on
13.6,"Krunal to Pant, FOUR runs","shoveled past short fine! Incredible shot. It's a yorker at leg stump, and he's got some stunning bat speed on this to stay upright but still get this behind the wicket. He's got it right under his eyes, and it's pretty full. That takes some doing. Brilliant skill"
13.5,"Krunal to Iyer, 1 run","good length on leg stump, pushed to deep midwicket off the back foot"
13.4,"Krunal to Iyer, no run","short of a length and turning away outside off, through his cut too soon as this grips in the pitch"
13.3,"Krunal to Pant, 1 run","full and wide outside off, reaches out and drives along the floor to deep extra cover"
13.2,"Krunal to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length and sliding at the stumps, backs away and punches to sweeper cover"
13.1,"Krunal to Pant, 1 run","low full toss at off stump, punched down to long-on"
13.1,"Krunal to Pant, 1 wide","yorker is very wide outside off, left alone"
12.6,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, 1 run","short and into the body, mistimed pull to deep backward square's right"
12.5,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, no run","yorker length outside off, driven off the toe-end to mid-off"
12.4,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, 1 run","slower short ball, really sticks in the pitch and comes in at Iyer's body as he backs away. Only gets an under-edge on his pull, down to long-on"
12.3,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, 1 run",good length and sliding on to middle stump. Driven to long-on with the angle
12.2,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, 1 run","length and looks like a slower one again. Just outside off, punched to long-on"
12.1,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, 1 run","cutter at a length outside off, steps out and punches to sweeper cover"
11.6,"Pollard to Iyer, SIX runs","slogs it over wide long-on! Pollard seemed to be getting away with a quiet over. The extra ball costs him in the end. It's at a length, spun into Iyer. He lines it up and gives it a right whack"
11.5,"Pollard to Pant, 1 run","slower ball at a length on middle stump, leans in and flicks to deep midwicket's right"
11.4,"Pollard to Pant, no run","short and climbing outside off again, past his attempted cut"
11.3,"Pollard to Pant, no run",beaten. Short of a length and cutting away in the corridor. Looks to slash through cover but that climbs over the bat
11.2,"Pollard to Pant, FOUR runs","slashed past point. Short of a length cutter outside off. Gets on the front foot and gets this between point and short third man. Pollard is around the wicket, but there is a lot of room"
11.1,"Pollard to Iyer, 1 run",short of a length and just outside off. Punched to long-off on the back foot
11.1,"Pollard to Iyer, 1 wide",full and spinning down leg. Beaten on the flick
10.6,"Bumrah to Iyer, 1 run","short of fine third man. Short and angled into Iyer, who is arching into the leg side for the ramp. A third man is put in there exactly for that. But it doesn't get close"
10.5,"Bumrah to Iyer, 2 runs",short and into the stomach. Waits on it and swipes with the angle to deep square's right. He was waiting on the back foot for this
10.4,"Bumrah to Iyer, no run",short and into the corridor. Nicely on top of that to defend to point
10.3,"Bumrah to Pant, 1 run","low full toss at off stump, punched to long-on with the angle"
10.2,"Bumrah to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, whipped to deep square off the back foot"
10.1,"Bumrah to Pant, 1 run",short of a length into the pads. Nudges to fine leg with the angle
9.6,"Krunal to Pant, 1 run","quicker yorker at off stump. Closes the face to jab that into midwicket, gets a thick edge towards short third"
9.5,"Krunal to Pant, SIX runs",slogged wayyyy over deep midwicket. Another sweet sounding hit from Pant. This is tossed up at a length and outside off. He gets down for the sweep and it slides on nicely. Beautiful swing through that ball with one knee down
9.4,"Krunal to Iyer, 1 run","good length on off stump, whips to deep midwicket off the back foot"
9.3,"Krunal to Pant, 1 run","oh well bowled. Keeps it slow, dipping at a leg stump line this time. Steps out and is beaten in flight. Swipes it out to deep square"
9.2,"Krunal to Pant, SIX runs","steps out and crunches that into the sightscreen. Might be the last time we see Krunal toss it up tonight, because that has been given a serious beating. On an off stump line and Pant is quickly down to the pitch of it. Drills it flat and over the bowler's head"
9.1,"Krunal to Iyer, 1 run","full on leg stump, driven firmly to long-on"
8.6,"Yadav to Pant, 2 runs","good length and into leg stump, steps out and dabs it expertly to deep midwicket's right to return for the second"
8.5,"Yadav to Pant, 2 runs",good length and into leg stump. Steps out and whips to deep backward square's right
8.4,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run",good length and turning into off stump. Shuffles and clips to deep square
8.3,"Yadav to Pant, 1 run","short of a length outside off, steps out and chops to sweeper cover"
8.2,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run","good length outside off, driven on the up to long-off"
8.1,"Yadav to Pant, 1 run",good length and sliding in at middle. Steps out and looks to force it down to long-off. Off the inside half and trickles towards long-on
7.6,"Krunal to Pant, 1 run","good length on leg stump, swept to deep midwicket's left"
7.5,"Krunal to Iyer, 1 run","good length on off stump, driven with the turn to long-off"
7.4,"Krunal to Iyer, no run",good length and tight at middle stump. Defended back down the pitch
7.3,"Krunal to Iyer, 2 runs",good length and gripping to turn away outside off. Gets back and turns it through vacant square leg with a closed face
7.2,"Krunal to Iyer, no run","short of a length outside off, chopped on the up to backward point"
7.1,"Krunal to Pant, 1 run",good length and slow at leg stump. Gets forward and flicks to deep square
6.6,"Yadav to Iyer, no run","beaten on the improv ramp. Reverse ramp. He wanted to go fine leg, but this length ball slid on wide outside off and he had to go the other way"
6.5,"Yadav to Pant, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven to long-on"
6.4,"Yadav to Pant, no run","good length on off stump, defended to cover"
6.3,"Yadav to Pant, 2 runs","short of a length and into leg stump. Deep in the crease to glance that to long leg, where NCN misfields and allows a second"
6.2,"Yadav to Pant, 2 runs","full outside off, driven to extra cover's right with the turn. Long-off cleans up"
6.1,"Yadav to Pant, no run","good length and into off stump, can't get his watchful punch past extra cover for the single at long-off"
5.6,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, no run",length and into leg stump. Runs into the leg side to create some room but is forced to jab that into the covers as it cramps into him
5.5,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, FOUR runs",good length and into the thigh. Stands tall and tickles that fine
5.4,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, chopped to third man"
5.3,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, 1 run","nearly plucks a stunner at cover! Iyer is fighting fire with fire, and at the moment he's just about surviving. Ishan Kishan drops a difficult catch to his right. Short of a length and just outside off, backs into the leg side and gives that a might slap on the rise. It's flown to Kishan's right at cover. High to his right. He's done well to time that leap to his right and get two hands to it. Perhaps one he would have taken with his gloves on. Too difficult to hope to hold onto that this time"
5.2,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, no run","short of a length outside off, chopped straight to cover"
5.1,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, no run","short of a length and just outside off, punched to extra cover off the back foot"
4.6,"Boult to Iyer, 1 run","awkward fend and safe because square leg is back. Can't accuse Iyer of being in control so far, but he's still there. This short ball is up at his crest. He's caught on the front foot, which is eventually raised after his weight falls backwards and he hooks half-heartedly from under the ball"
4.5,"Boult to Iyer, FOUR runs",aerial again but dipping away from the diving extra cover. It's lovely timing on this. Short of a length and climbing in the corridor again. Gets on this toes and punches from under his eyes. It's quickly into the boundary
4.4,"Boult to Iyer, no run","short of a length at middle stump, rises on top of that and defends into the leg side"
4.3,"Boult to Iyer, no run","beaten. Shuffling, dancing, skipping, slashing. Short of a length ball outside off and Iyer has to play the cut backing away after all that. It's past him quickly"
4.2,"Boult to Iyer, FOUR runs",aerial but between extra and mid-off. Good length and climbing in the corridor. Drives on the up with a half-stride. Not fully in control of that either
4.1,"Boult to Pant, 1 run","good length and into off stump, front leg across and patted to mid-on"
3.6,"Yadav to Pant, 1 run","good length and into middle stump, leans in and jabs it to mid-on with the angle"
3.5,"Yadav to Pant, 2 runs",short of a length and into middle stump. Gets deep in the crease and whips this to deep square's right
3.4,"Yadav to Pant, no run","good length at off stump, defended down the pitch"
3.3,"Yadav to S Dhawan, OUT","knocks off stump! They brought him in for the left-handers, and three balls in, he's got their best one this season. It's at a good length, around a middle stump line. He's given it some air and got a bit of grip from the surface. Dhawan is down and playing the slog sweep pretty early. And he's through the shot before the ball arrives. Some turn away and tonks the stumps"
3.2,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run",good length and turning in from just outside off. Defended to cover off the front foot
3.1,"Yadav to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length at off stump, looks to drive. Big gap between bat and pad as he looks to drive through cover. Slides on and gets the inside half of the bat"
2.6,"Boult to Iyer, no run","leading edge short of the bowler. Bouncy, bouncy. Short of a length ball is up at Iyer's ribs. He's tried to get on top of that and close the face on it for the single to fine leg. He's done it too soon but he survives"
2.5,"Boult to Iyer, FOUR runs","edged over keeper and slip. Whew, adventurous shot to say the least. Not in control of that. It's a short ball angled wide outside off. Rises sharply and he chases that to try and steer it to third man. No chance he's getting on top of that with this bounce"
2.4,"Boult to Rahane, OUT","there's a sound and it's given! Rahane is caught down leg side. Good length, not a lot of movement on this. Some movement in Rahane's feet though, a little shuffle towards middle stump. He's tried to flick from there as the ball slides wide of him down leg side. It's thin edge, a faint sound, followed by thunderous roars from the fielders"
2.3,"Boult to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length and just outside off, dropped into the covers with soft hands"
2.2,"Boult to S Dhawan, no run",good length and into the pads. Hangs back for the glance but cops it on the pad. QDK saves to his right
2.1,"Boult to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",slashed over cover. Runs down at this length ball that's shaped away from him. Has judged it perfectly. Has enough room to swing from under that
1.6,"Bumrah to Rahane, no run",edge onto body and dead before the keeper. Length ball outside off and he had a stab at that on the front foot
1.5,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, 1 run","big inswinger that Dhawan has survived this time! Nailed him with a yorker last match. This one is marginally shorter, more driving length. Into leg stump and he's scrambing, both feet sliding around the crease as he flicks onto pad and Rahane steals a run from the keeper"
1.4,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length and across the corridor, past him quickly as he shapes to defend"
1.3,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",just clears QDK! Short of a length and getting steep in the corridor. Dhawan is looking to get on top of that and guide that towards third an with the bat face pointed down. It takes the high part of the outside edge and is past the keeper
1.2,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, no run",good length and into of stump. Deep in the crease to defend that into the covers
1.1,"Bumrah to Rahane, 1 run",short of a length and wide outside off. Watchfully steers that to third man's right
0.6,"Boult to S Dhawan, no run","good length and swung away just outside off. Checks himself after shaping for a drive, but he gets some sweet timing on this punch to mid-off"
0.5,"Boult to S Dhawan, no run",
0.4,"Boult to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","handsomely clipped through midwicket. Full and swung marginally towards slip, but it's started on a leg stump line. Gentle, float half-volley and he holds a lovely shape as he closes the face on it"
0.3,"Boult to S Dhawan, no run","good length and swing away outside off, left alone"
0.2,"Boult to Rahane, 1 run",full and swing into middle stump leans in and jabs that to midwicket
0.1,"Boult to Stoinis, OUT","got him first ball! Felled the Hulk first up! Short of a good length, rising in the corridor. Stoinis defends for the one coming in but has ended up playing inside the line and is all sorts of contorted. It takes the thick outside edge and floats gently to QDK's right. After a brief move from the patterns, Capitals are back to their recent problem of failed first-wicket stands"
19.6,"Nortje to Sandeep, no run","backs away, Nortje stays full and straight, and he slips trying to protect his wicket"
19.5,"Nortje to Sandeep, no run","follows him with a bouncer, and he ducks it"
19.4,"Nortje to Nadeem, 1 run","full and straight, driven to long-on for one"
19.3,"Nortje to Sandeep, 1 run","he backs away, and Nortje follows him with a low full toss. Just the single to midwicket"
19.2,"Nortje to Nadeem, 1 run","yorker, nails it, just the single"
19.1,"Nortje to Sandeep, 1 run","makes room, hits hard, but can't get under a full ball. Just the single"
18.6,"Rabada to Nadeem, no run",shuffles across to look to ramp but is beaten by a full ball
18.5,"Rabada to Goswami, OUT","and he has three wickets in three legal balls. Slower short ball again, Goswami looks to pull over midwicket but doesn't get any power into the shot. Caught at deep midwicket"
18.5,"Rabada to Goswami, 1 wide","slower short ball, too high, called a wide"
18.4,"Rabada to Rashid Khan, OUT","that oughta do it for DC. Rabada hasn;t quite nailed the yorker, but he is full enough to not let him get under it. Rashid tries, but goes only as far as long-on"
18.3,"Rabada to Abdul Samad, OUT","Keemo Paul takes the catch at long-off. After missing two yorkers, Rabada gets one nearly right. And because it is straight, it has given Samad no room to swing his arms. He toe-ends it to long-off, and Paul takes the catch to his left"
18.2,"Rabada to Abdul Samad, SIX runs",that is a high full toss. And just a nonchalant flick of the wrists sends this sailing over deep square leg for six. Still alive. Not called a no-ball
18.1,"Rabada to Rashid Khan, 1 run","quick thigh-high full toss, and he gets no power into this. Just the single to deep midwicket"
17.6,"Ashwin to Rashid Khan, 1 leg bye",and he protects the over by following him as he leaves the crease. Off the pad for a leg-bye
17.5,"Ashwin to Rashid Khan, no run",yorker this time. Ashwin gets it right. Dug out. No run
17.4,"Ashwin to Rashid Khan, FOUR runs","wide length ball, and he goes over extra cover this time. He has nailed it. SRH refusing to roll over and die"
17.3,"Ashwin to Rashid Khan, SIX runs","another slog sweep, and he has given this his all. Gets this off the toe end, but has got just enough behind it to clear long-on"
17.2,"Ashwin to Rashid Khan, no run","tries the big slog sweep, but is beaten by the carrom ball"
17.1,"Ashwin to Abdul Samad, 1 run","fires in a yorker, inside edge to short fine leg, and Rashid calls him through for one"
16.6,"Stoinis to Abdul Samad, 1 run","high full toss, but not high enough to be called a no-ball. Samad is a little surprised, and pushes this to wide long-on for one"
16.5,"Stoinis to Williamson, OUT","is this the game? Stoinis has produced another wicket. Williamson finally makes a mistake. He has not looked to hit this one into a gap. Stoinis has gone full and wide, and off-cutter. Williamson commits to hitting it in the air and over cover, which means he has to go all the way, but this is too far from him to get power behind the shot. Caught at deep cover"
16.4,"Stoinis to Williamson, FOUR runs","this is just lovely batting. He has picked his spot beautifully. Third man and point are up, but the cover is pretty straight. Stoinis goes short of a length, and he makes room to hit this square on the off side. Beats deep cover"
16.3,"Stoinis to Abdul Samad, 1 run","full, not exactly a yorker, drilled to long-off. Iyer has hurt his left shoulder while throwing this back"
16.2,"Stoinis to Abdul Samad, 2 runs","slower ball, short of a length, punched hard, forward of deep cover, Rabada puts in a dive, saves two runs. Are SRH thinking of their own fielding effort?"
16.1,"Stoinis to Williamson, 1 run","full, low, wide, hit to extra cover for one"
15.6,"Ashwin to Williamson, 1 run","mis-hit to a length ball, but it doesn't carry to long-on. Ten off the over. A difficult time to bowl for him, and he seems to have done okay"
15.5,"Ashwin to Abdul Samad, 1 run","wide legbreak, and Samad needn't have cut at it. Would have been called a wide. Cue-ends this for one"
15.4,"Ashwin to Williamson, 1 run","on a length, straight, holds its line, pushed to deep midwicket for one"
15.3,"Ashwin to Williamson, FOUR runs","short, wide, Williamson has to reach it, but he throws all his might at it. He has cut this in the air, but has managed to place it between point and cover-point"
15.2,"Ashwin to Abdul Samad, 1 run","short of a length, whipped to deep midwicket for one"
15.1,"Ashwin to Abdul Samad, 2 runs","and some more fortune. Carrom ball outside off, and Samad cue-ends it past short third man"
14.6,"Nortje to Williamson, no run","another pinpoint yorker. I said 20, they got 16"
14.5,"Nortje to Abdul Samad, 1 run","yorker, middle and leg, dug out for one"
14.4,"Nortje to Abdul Samad, FOUR runs","full and wide with third man up. Not the smartest ball. Samad throws his bat at it, gets a thick edge, which clears short third easily"
14.3,"Nortje to Abdul Samad, FOUR runs","wide length ball, he stays back, and cuts this over point. Some timing that. Suddenly there is an added dimension to this match"
14.2,"Nortje to Abdul Samad, SIX runs",have some of it. This is a hook out of the screws. Phew. Has he nailed this or what? Disdainful hook to a high bouncer. Off the middle of the bat with time to spare. Clears midwicket with ease
14.1,"Nortje to Williamson, 1 run","more luck for Williamson. Completely done in by a slower ball, and gets a thick inside edge on the slog. His body is in the way, though, and saves him from getting bowled"
13.6,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","smart bowling. Sees him come down, and slows it down and pulls the length ball. Pushed to extra cover for one"
13.5,"Axar Patel to Williamson, FOUR runs","this is perhaps the first time the luck has run SRH's way tonight. Looks to hit this length ball hard, and gets an edge thick enough to go past Pant"
13.4,"Axar Patel to Abdul Samad, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, pushed to deep midwicket for one"
13.3,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","on a length, dipping on him, pushed to deep extra cover for one. Another fifty for him. Job half done"
13.2,"Axar Patel to Abdul Samad, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, pushed to long-on for one"
13.1,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","Williamson is looking for the big shot, but Patel follows him, and he still hits it wide of long-on. Incredibly, Samad turns down the second"
12.6,"Stoinis to Williamson, 1 run","slower offcutter, just the single. Smart comeback from Stoinis after being hit for a six off the first ball"
12.5,"Stoinis to Williamson, no run","shuffles across for the ramp, Stoinis does him in twice. Not only does he go wide to make him look to go past short third, he has also bowled a slower ball, which means he gets an edge on this back to him"
12.4,"Stoinis to Williamson, no run","misses out. Stoinis has bowled a length ball sliding down leg, and he looks to get inside the line and go behind square in the leg side. Is beaten and hit on the pad"
12.3,"Stoinis to Abdul Samad, 1 run","short of a length, just outside off, pushed wide of cover for one"
12.2,"Stoinis to Williamson, 1 run","on a length, quick, soft hands, pushed towards long-on. Can't get back for the second"
12.1,"Stoinis to Williamson, SIX runs","filthy little full toss down the leg side, and would have been wide had Williamson not gone low and shovelled this over square leg for a six"
11.6,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","quicker, flatter, punched to that deep extra cover for one"
11.5,"Axar Patel to Williamson, FOUR runs","slow, wide, looking to draw a mis-hit, but Williamson waits for it, and then cuts it square of deep cover who is very straight to plug his extra cover hits"
11.4,"Axar Patel to Holder, OUT","smart bowling from Axar. The thing with Holder's charge as against Williamson's is, he comes down early, and Axar fires it in and follows him too. Takes his arms out of the shot. And is caught at deep midwicket"
11.3,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","flatter, quicker, punched to deep cover for one"
11.2,"Axar Patel to Williamson, no run","slows this down, gets it to dip, pushes to extra cover, and they don't get the single despite a Rahane fumble"
11.1,"Axar Patel to Williamson, SIX runs","lovely shot. Down the wicket, gives himself slight room, reaches the pitch of the ball but hits this back over his head"
10.6,"Rabada to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, runs this down to third man for one"
10.5,"Rabada to Williamson, SIX runs","Williamson slogs, and slogs this out of the screws. Gets close to a wide length ball, and goes over midwicket. Incredible shot but he needs to do this more often"
10.4,"Rabada to Williamson, no run","short of a length, holds its line, and Williamson draws out of a dab"
10.4,"Rabada to Williamson, 1 wide","bouncer, down the leg side, and Williamson looks to go over fine leg. Beaten. Wide"
10.3,"Rabada to Williamson, no run","on a length, outside off, and he dead-bats it. Three dots"
10.2,"Rabada to Williamson, no run",again done in by inswing. Rabada hits his thigh pad this time
10.1,"Rabada to Williamson, no run","swinging in, on a length, beats the inside edge, hits his pad, but again high"
9.6,"Dubey to Williamson, 1 run","down the wicket, too close to its pitch, drives this down to long-on for one"
9.5,"Dubey to Holder, 1 run","and that is why. Holder is hitting them straight, and the straight long-off doesn't have to move sideways at all"
9.4,"Dubey to Williamson, 1 run","full, on off, driven with an open face to deep cover for one"
9.3,"Dubey to Williamson, SIX runs","Williamson skips down too, and he is not close to the pitch of the ball so he has room to swing his arms through it and clears long-on with ease"
9.2,"Dubey to Holder, 1 run","down the wicket, almost gets too close to the pitch of the ball so he doesn't get the elevation. He has got a lot of power, though, and Nortje has to put in a dive at long-off to keep this in"
9.1,"Dubey to Williamson, 1 run","seems there has been a word in the timeout. Tries the slog first up, is yorked a little, and gets just the single"
8.6,"Axar Patel to Holder, 2 runs","slightly short of a length, and Holder is quick to pick the length and hit this wide of long-on. Dubey fields it one-handed and is very close to the boundary triangles but stays inside"
8.5,"Axar Patel to Holder, no run","Holder looking to lap him fine this time, but the ball sits in the surface and takes the front edge back to Axar"
8.4,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","on a length, quick, no room, so he can only punch this straight to deep cover"
8.3,"Axar Patel to Holder, 1 run","on a length, angling in, helped around the corner for one"
8.2,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","slows this down, Williamson is looking to go over extra but sees he is not to the pitch of this so he aborts and pushes this along the ground to deep cover"
8.1,"Axar Patel to Williamson, FOUR runs","finally intent from Williamson. He knows Axar bowls fast, and he gets inside the line to lap-sweep this fine of fine leg"
7.6,"Dubey to Williamson, 1 run","on a length, and Williamson goes back to punch this to deep cover"
7.5,"Dubey to Williamson, no run","down the wicket, beaten in the flight, another defensive push back to him"
7.4,"Dubey to Williamson, no run","slow legbreak, defended to cover"
7.3,"Dubey to Holder, 1 run","full and straight, can't get under it, driven to long-on for one"
7.2,"Dubey to Holder, no run","some dip and drift on this, but no turn. Hits Hiolder's pad"
7.1,"Dubey to Williamson, 1 run","full, straight, pushed straight of the diving short straight midwicket for one"
6.6,"Axar Patel to Holder, no run","quick again, slightly fuller, but also straighter. Holder can't do much with this. Another good start from Axar"
6.5,"Axar Patel to Holder, no run","quicker, on a length, arm ball, beats Holder who is looking for the turn"
6.4,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","stays low, on a length, angling in, punched down to long-on for one"
6.3,"Axar Patel to Williamson, no run","fuller, slower, just outside off, pushed to cover"
6.2,"Axar Patel to Holder, 1 run","short of a length, slow, pushed wide of midwicket for one"
6.1,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","quick length ball, turn for him, punched to deep cover for one"
5.6,"Nortje to Holder, no run","only slightly short of a length, and he is looking to pull this. Lucky to get an inside edge onto the pad"
5.5,"Nortje to Holder, FOUR runs",Holder has been looking to go past point for the last two balls but gets it right this time. Punches this away frmm the body but gets the timing and placement this time
5.4,"Nortje to Holder, no run","slightly wider, Holder stays back to look to punch it, but is beaten"
5.3,"Nortje to Holder, no run","on a length, not too wide, pushed to point with an open face"
5.2,"Nortje to Williamson, 1 run","on a length, straight, pushed wide of mid-on for one"
5.1,"Nortje to Williamson, no run","short of a length, outside off, doesn't quite come on, ends up punching this in front of square"
4.6,"Stoinis to Pandey, OUT","oh golden arm if ever there was one. Huge wicket of Pandey with the extra ball because of the wide. This is in the slot to swing hard at, but he has bowled a little offcutter to take the inside half of his bat. Caught at mid-on"
4.5,"Stoinis to Williamson, 1 run","wide length ball, dabbed to third man for one"
4.4,"Stoinis to Garg, OUT","he has missed a full straight half-volley. Garg will be bitterly disappointed he has got out bowled to a nothing ball. Half-volley, just outside off, and he has pushed outside the line of this. There is a bit of movement but he is playing down the wrong line all the way. this ball should not be getting you a wicket in a knockout match of the best T20 league"
4.3,"Stoinis to Pandey, 1 run","on a length, extra bounce on this slower ball, punched down to mid-on for one"
4.3,"Stoinis to Pandey, 1 wide","slower ball, wide down the leg side"
4.2,"Stoinis to Pandey, FOUR runs","short, hip-high, and while he has a deep square leg in place, Pandey is smart enough to go inside the line and go behind square with his short-arm pull"
4.1,"Stoinis to Garg, 1 run","down the wicket right away. Stoinis pulls the length back, pulled to deep square leg for one"
3.6,"Rabada to Garg, 1 run","quick length ball, into the pads, goes off the front edge for a single to mid-on"
3.5,"Rabada to Pandey, 1 run","on a length, angling in, pushed to mid-on for one"
3.4,"Rabada to Pandey, 2 runs","full, just outside off, and Pandey gets a thick outside edge over point. Ashwin just jogs across to the ball"
3.3,"Rabada to Garg, 1 run","on a length, hits him high on the bat, goes for a single to square leg. The bat comes out of his hand on impact"
3.2,"Rabada to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, runs this one straight to third man for one"
3.1,"Rabada to Pandey, 2 runs","short of a length, outside off, runs this down fine of square third man, and they also take on Ashwin to make the second comfortably"
2.6,"Nortje to Garg, no run",an iffy little push to a wide length ball with no foot movement. Beaten on the outside edge
2.5,"Nortje to Garg, SIX runs","the bouncer gets big on him, but Garg has hooked this a long way. Uses his pace to go behind square. Clears long leg with ease"
2.4,"Nortje to Garg, no run","big lbw shout but the height has saved him. This swings back in from a length, and Garg swings without his feet moving. Hit in front but high on the pad"
2.3,"Nortje to Garg, no run","short of a length, hits him high on the bat. Defended"
2.2,"Nortje to Pandey, 1 run","that is better from Nortje. On a length, into the 140s, swinging it in, inside edge onto the pad for one"
2.1,"Nortje to Pandey, FOUR runs","lovely shot from Pandey. A gentle loosener, mid-130s, right in the slot, and he stays leg-side of it, and lofts him back over his head"
1.6,"Rabada to Pandey, 1 run","on a length, angling in, pushed uppishly and wide of mid-on for one"
1.5,"Rabada to Pandey, no run","short of a length, leaving him, left alone again"
1.4,"Rabada to Pandey, no run","short of a length, extra bounce, and leaves him too. He doesn't follow it"
1.3,"Rabada to Pandey, FOUR runs","lovely off drive. The mid-off is wide, and he plays the push-drive to the full ball, and beats him to his right"
1.2,"Rabada to Pandey, no run","lovely outswinger, left alone outside off"
1.1,"Rabada to Warner, OUT","bowled him. Lovely ball but Warner also sightly unlucky to get out to this. Full inswinger, going well down leg, Warner looks to get out of the way and work this to leg, but the swing beats him and hits his pad and it deflects back a long way to hit the wicket"
0.6,"Ashwin to Garg, no run","big offbreak, starts from well outside off and ends up cramping him up. Draws a dot"
0.5,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","on a length, quick, angling in, pushed to leg for one"
0.5,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 wide",wide down the leg side again as Ashwin looks to tuck Warner up
0.4,"Ashwin to Garg, 1 run","wide on the crease, offbreak, pushed wide of mid-on for one"
0.4,"Ashwin to Garg, 1 wide","wrong'un. Shows him the wristspin, and bowls the googly, but ends up sliding this wide down the leg side"
0.3,"Ashwin to Garg, SIX runs","and Garg attacks Ashwin early. They needed this right-left split to unsettle Ashwin, and Garg is showing the right intent. Down on a knee, and slog-sweeps this length ball over deep midwicket"
0.2,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run","quick, drifting in, pushed to mid-on, who is hanging back at the edge of the circle"
0.1,"Ashwin to Garg, 1 run","nearly a wicket first ball. Plays for the turn, closes the face, gets a leading edge, but it doesn't carry to point. And Hetmyer goes for the catch, which allows a single as the ball skids past his dive"
19.6,"Natarajan to Hetmyer, 1 bye","excellent yorker, this one reverses in a lttile to beat him altogether. Pant does the smart thing to sneak in a bye"
19.5,"Natarajan to Hetmyer, 2 runs","another yorker, but Hetmyer goes deep into the crease and opens the face to get a couple square of deep cover"
19.4,"Natarajan to Pant, 1 run","yet another wide yorker, Pant looks to go down the ground but only cues it back down the wicket for a single"
19.3,"Natarajan to Hetmyer, 1 run","another attempt at the ramp, and Natarajan nails the wide yorker again, and it goes off the toe end towards straight midwicket for one"
19.2,"Natarajan to Pant, 1 leg bye",looks to go across and tries the ramp but Natarajan nails the wide yorker to concede just the leg-bye
19.1,"Natarajan to Hetmyer, 1 run","Hetmyer down the wicket to convert this yorker into a low full toss, but gets no power into the shot. Just the single to long-on"

18.3,"Sandeep to S Dhawan, OUT","Dhawan looks for the revere sweep, but Sandeep beats him with a quick full toss and he has been given out lbw. It seems he has been hit outside the line but he doesn't bother reviewing. Hit well outside the line but Dhawan doesn't even look at his non-striker to check if he should review"
18.2,"Sandeep to Hetmyer, 1 run","goes wide yorker, Hetmyer stays deep in the crease to drive this to deep cover"
18.1,"Sandeep to S Dhawan, 1 run","oh Rashid has dropped a sitter at deep midwicket. Absolute shocker of a night for SRH. Knuckle ball from Sandeep, right in the slot, but Dhawan doesn't get all on this slog. Rashid, though, lets it slip through"
17.6,"Holder to Hetmyer, FOUR runs","bouncer from Holder, Hetmyer is not in control of the pull, but he has sent this straight enough of the deep midwicket fielder. Yorks the boundary triangle"

17.4,"Holder to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","Dhawan has been trying this since the start of the last over but gets it right this time. Shuffles across to go to the leg side, Holder serves up a straight full toss, and he flicks this to the vacant square leg fence, Six hundred runs for Dhawan this IPL"
17.3,"Holder to Hetmyer, 1 run","goes for the wide yorker, ends up bowling a low full toss, and Hetmyer gets an inside edge for one"
17.2,"Holder to Hetmyer, FOUR runs","Nadeem's nightmare continues. Holder bowls wide and length, draws a slice from Hetmyer, Nadeem gets under it at third man, but as he goes down he loses the ball and doesn't even get a touch on it. And as he tumbles extravagantly, the ball rolls away for a four"
17.1,"Holder to Hetmyer, FOUR runs","slot ball, outside off, and Hetmyer stays deep in the crease to stay under it and smacks this straight of long-off for four"
16.6,"Natarajan to S Dhawan, no run","well bowled. Dhawan shuffles across early to try to go over short fine, but Natarajan bowls a wide yorker, really wide, and beats him. Good comeback after that early six off him"

16.2,"Natarajan to Hetmyer, SIX runs","oh the Hetmyer power. And timing. Natarajan bowls short of a length, just outside off, and he plays the inside0out drive to it, and clears the man at deep cover. Incredible hitting"
16.1,"Natarajan to S Dhawan, 1 run","fine leg is up so Dhawan shuffles across, but Natarajan stays wide with this short-of-a-lenght ball. Just the single to deep square leg"

14.6,"Nadeem to Hetmyer, (no ball) 2 runs","another yorker, soft hands, bunted to midwicket, only to the 30-yard circle with no one inside the circle. They sneak in a second. And what's more? This is a no-ball"
14.5,"Nadeem to Hetmyer, no run","quick yorker this time, dug out back to him"
14.4,"Nadeem to Hetmyer, FOUR runs","immediate impact. Nadeem slows it down, but gets no action it. Ends up bowling a plum half-volley, and he chips it over extra cover for four"

14.2,"Nadeem to S Dhawan, 2 runs","Nadeem is hoping this hits the wicket at the non-striker's end as Dhawan has drilled this hard and straight. It misses the wicket, and they get two"
14.1,"Nadeem to S Dhawan, 2 runs","down the wicket, driven to wide long-on where Garg has twisted his ankle trying to slide and pick up"
13.6,"Holder to Iyer, OUT","finally one goes to hand. Iyer backs away again, Holder digs it in, doesn't give him room, and Iyer goes ahead with an aggressive shot. Ends up flat-batting this straight to mid-off"
13.5,"Holder to Iyer, 2 runs","another catch dropped. Anorher half chance. Iyer backs away early, goes deep in the crease, turns this into a driveable length but doesn't get all of it. Williamson runs to his right from extra cover and then leaps in the air, but only gets finger tips to it"
13.4,"Holder to Iyer, 2 runs","slower ball, big slog, off the inside half of the bat for two wide of long-on"
13.3,"Holder to Iyer, no run",extra bounce. That will interest the DC quicks. Iyer is surprised by this tennis-ball bounce outside off. Beaten when looking to turn this to leg

12.1,"Nadeem to S Dhawan, no run",finally he doesn't start an over with a six first-ball to Dhawan. Bowls a yorker as Dhawan backs away. Right at the cue of the bat

11.4,"Natarajan to Iyer, 1 run","Iyer shuffles across early and then backs away, which he often does. Natarajan stays short with no room. Cut to deep cover for one"

9.4,"Nadeem to S Dhawan, 2 runs",another full toss. Nadeem is having a shicker. Dhawan has flicked this between deep midwicket and deep square. Samad dives to save the boundary but Holder is close to him and his spike lands on Samad's hand
9.3,"Nadeem to S Dhawan, 2 runs","low full toss, worked behind square for two"
9.2,"Nadeem to S Dhawan, SIX runs",Dhawan brings up a fifty off just 26 balls with another slog-sweep. Clears deep midwicket with ease. The dugout on its feet

8.6,"Rashid Khan to S Dhawan, no run","beaten on the legbreak. Plays the angle, looking to drive this length ball into the covers. Beaten on the inside edge"
8.5,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, 1 run","another wrong'un, goes back now to push him down the ground for one"
8.4,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, no run","doesn't pick the wrong'un. Looks to cut, but is beaten on the inside edge"
8.3,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, 2 runs","oh that is a rare loose ball. A full toss, on off, and driven past extra cover two"
8.2,"Rashid Khan to Stoinis, OUT","that is a ripper. Rashid gives SRH the relief they need. Full quick legbreak, pitches on off, Stoinis plays for the angle, and the ball turns just enough past the bat toknock back the off stump"

6.4,"Rashid Khan to S Dhawan, 6 runs","short this time, Dhawan goes back to pull this wide of long-on. Rashid has now conceded four overthrows. Clearly shows his frustration.

6.2,"Rashid Khan to S Dhawan, 1 run","legbreak, middle and leg, worked leg"

5.1,"Nadeem to S Dhawan, SIX runs","and Dhawan loves left-arm spin. Slog-sweeps the first ball, and goes well over deep midwicket for a six"
4.6,"Sandeep to Stoinis, no run",yorker to end the over. Draws a dot
4.5,"Sandeep to S Dhawan, 1 run","on a length, on off, pushed wide of cover for one"
4.4,"Sandeep to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","wheels are coming off for SRH. Natarajan lets it slip through his legs at short fine leg. Sandeep swings it in, Dhawan glances it to short fine, but Natarajan gives away four runs"
4.3,"Sandeep to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","and now Dhawan joins the party. Shows him the shuffle across and then backs away to cash in on the room available. Cuts him in the air, but to the left of point"
4.2,"Sandeep to Stoinis, 1 run","waits for this to swing, delays his swing, pushes it wide of midwicket for one"
4.1,"Sandeep to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, straight, punched to deep forward square leg. Gets the single. Over to Stoinis"
3.6,"Holder to Stoinis, FOUR runs","Holder looking clueless right now. Bowls short of a length but gives him the required width. Stoinis late-cuts this, between point and short third man, even though it is aerial for a while"
3.5,"Holder to Stoinis, SIX runs","slower ball it seems like, 114ks, and it is right in his slot. He delays his swing and slogs this over wide long-on for a six. Clear plan, clear execution"
3.4,"Holder to Stoinis, no run","full and straight, clipped to midwicket"
3.3,"Holder to Stoinis, FOUR runs","no half measures from Stoinis. Doing the job he is asked to do. Skipped down the track, Holder shortens the length, and then he slaps this down the wicket, straight of mid-on. Gets timing and power in it"
3.2,"Holder to Stoinis, no run","lovely outswinger. Wide on the crease, on a length, makes him play the angle, and then leaves him. Too good to take the edge"
3.1,"Holder to Stoinis, FOUR runs",catching height but this is a blistering pull and wide of the diving midwicket. This is a powerful pull from well outside off as Holder pitches short
2.6,"Sandeep to Stoinis, 1 run","slower ball to end the over, bunted to square leg for one"
2.5,"Sandeep to Stoinis, FOUR runs","walks at him, gets inside the line and flicks this to the right of deep forward square leg. This is along the ground"
2.4,"Sandeep to Stoinis, FOUR runs","gets a little too full and a little too straight with this inswinger, and Stoinis whips this to leg despite the presence of a deep forward square leg. Beats him to his left"
2.3,"Sandeep to Stoinis, no run","dropped. The plan nearly works. Stoinis punches this inswinger in the air, to the right of silly mid-on. It is the tall Holder, who dives to his right, gets a hand to it, but can't hold on. Tough chance but a chance nonetheless"
2.2,"Sandeep to Stoinis, no run","big inswinger, but it ends up on off and middle as always. Stoinis can't do much with it"
2.1,"Sandeep to S Dhawan, 1 run","on a length, swinging away, uses soft hands to get a single to point"
1.6,"Holder to S Dhawan, 1 run",again he denies him any room and Dhawan tucks this off the hip for a single square of short fine leg

1.4,"Holder to S Dhawan, no run","tighter line, and this swings back in too, tucking him up. Dot"

1.2,"Holder to S Dhawan, 2 runs","nice little late-cut to one pitched just short of a length, but their third man is square because they know of Dhawan's strengths"

0.6,"Sandeep to Stoinis, 1 run","big inswinger, Stoinis does well to play this late, pushes this straight of that silly mid-on. Gets a single to long-on"

0.1,"Sandeep to Stoinis, no run","inswinger, on a length, shaping in towards off, punched to mid-off"
19.4,"Saini to Holder, FOUR runs","that's past point for the win! Oh that is questionably tactics, honestly. Yorkers outside off with third man and point inside. Holder shuffles again, waits on the yorker length delivery. It's a low full toss and he gets it to point's right"
19.3,"Saini to Holder, FOUR runs",drilled to long-off's left! This is driving length outside off. Holder has taken a big step into the off side for the full ball that he expects there. Gets a little more than he expects  - a pretty friendly driving ball. Gets the front leg out of the way and opens the face to beat that fielder
19.2,"Saini to Holder, no run",beaten outside off. Yorker outside off at 144.6kph. Holder is a little late on the swish as it marginally tails inwards
19.1,"Saini to Williamson, 1 run","overpitched outside off, driven along the ground to sweeper cover to bring up his fifty. He needed to bring it this deep after his start, and he has done exactly that"
18.6,"Siraj to Williamson, 1 run","ramped wide of short fine and then he slips at the other end. Full ball outside off, gets low and gets a bit too much bat on this. It floats harmlessly and lands to Saini's left"
18.5,"Siraj to Williamson, no run","full slower ball, a dipping full toss on off stump. KW making room by getting into the leg side but is deceived by the pace. It bounce back to the bowler"
18.4,"Siraj to Williamson, 2 runs",steps across and ramps over short fine. Another overpitched ball outside off. Gets the front leg into the off side and gets a bit too much elevation on that for it to run away. Plops into the turf and short fine runs back and drags it in
18.3,"Siraj to Holder, 1 run","yorker length at middle stump, jammed down to long-on where Kohli does superbly with a one-handed pick up to keep them to one"
18.2,"Siraj to Holder, FOUR runs","outside half and it's past short third. That's a length ball, outside off. Holder gets the front leg away and looks to blaze that through the off side. The bat face is open and it slides off it. Point was back, third man was in"
18.1,"Siraj to Williamson, 1 run",inside edge to short fine as he looks to latch onto a full ball outside off
17.6,"Saini to Williamson, 1 run","low full toss at off stump, shuffles and flicks to deep midwicket"
17.5,"Saini to Williamson, 2 runs","full and just outside off, chopped to sweeper's left and an early call for the second"
17.4,"Saini to Williamson, FOUR runs","steered between keeper and short third. Good length and angled into the corridor. Waits on it, stays sufficiently inside the line and opens the face to dab that fine of the fielder"
17.3,"Saini to Holder, 1 run","good length and just outside off, slapped firmly on the rise and bursts through Chahal's grasp at extra cover. But he recovers and keeps it to one"
17.2,"Saini to Williamson, 1 run","dropped at deep square. Saves five runs though. Williamson has chipped a thigh-high full toss to Padikkal, who might have just stretched upwards too early for this catch. Can't keep his balance as he lands on his back foot and loses footing. Lobs it back in but too far away to return to take it"
17.1,"Saini to Holder, 1 run","full outside off, driven long the ground to sweeper"
16.6,"Dubey to Williamson, no run","short of a length and just outside off, opens the face and runs it straight to short third"
16.5,"Dubey to Williamson, FOUR runs","crunched to sweeper's right. The intention is clear now from Dube - he'll bowl full and at the stumps. KW is backing just about a foot into the leg side to account for that. For his smarts, he's rewarded with an overpitched ball just outside off and he leans into that drive"
16.4,"Dubey to Holder, 1 run","yorker floated up at off stump, squeezed down to long-on off the toe-end"
16.3,"Dubey to Holder, no run","beaten on the slog as Dube slows it down. Good length, offcutter, following him down leg side. It's past his inside edge"
16.2,"Dubey to Williamson, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven along the ground to long-off"
16.1,"Dubey to Holder, 1 run","yorker length at middle stump, jammed down to long-on"
15.6,"Chahal to Williamson, SIX runs","slog sweep to see Chahal off! Once again, Williamson has picked his release shot with perfect judgement. This is tossed up full and at middle stump. He's quickly on his knee, front leg out in the leg side, and sends that over deep midwicket"
15.5,"Chahal to Holder, 1 run","full on off stump, driven to long-off with the turn"
15.4,"Chahal to Holder, no run","beaten. Cannot resist, but possibly misses out on a wide here because of how big his reach appears. This is tossed right up, wide outside off, spins past his attempted drill over extra cover"
15.3,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run","full on middle stump, jammed down to long-on"
15.2,"Chahal to Holder, 1 run","a fumble at point from Sundar as he loses his footing. Good length outside off, pushed with soft hands and he gets a hand reaching backward as he slips"
15.1,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run",good length and sliding onto middle. Punched to long-on off the back foot
14.6,"Zampa to Williamson, 1 run",full and just outside off. Leans in and pushes into the vacant leg side again
14.5,"Zampa to Holder, 1 run","good length and sliding on at middle stump, deep in the crease and pushed into vacant midwicket"
14.4,"Zampa to Williamson, 1 run",tossed up full outside off. Reaches out and sweeps to long-on's right. Quick work from the man there to keep it to a single
14.3,"Zampa to Holder, 1 run",good length and a quicker one it appears. Gets forward and pats aerially down to long-off
14.2,"Zampa to Williamson, 1 run",full and at the stumps. Stretches out at that and clips to long-on
14.1,"Zampa to Holder, 1 run",googly at a length outside off. Looks like Holder's picked that. Well forward as he flicks to deep midwicket's right
13.6,"Sundar to Williamson, 2 runs",short of a length and flat outside off. Waits leg side of that as it slides straight on and dabs it to short third man's right
13.5,"Sundar to Williamson, SIX runs","slogs it cleanly over deep midwicket! Full from Sundar, and faster. He clears the front leg and goes with the turn. Wonderful sound off the bat"
13.4,"Sundar to Williamson, no run",short of a length and turning into middle stump. Backs away and gets the punch only as far as extra cover
13.3,"Sundar to Holder, 1 run","falls short of  deep midwicket. Short of a length at middle stump, aerial pull comes off the toe-end"
13.2,"Sundar to Holder, no run","short of a length and just outside off, punched to extra cover's right"
13.1,"Sundar to Holder, no run",short of a length and holding in the surface. Check-pushes to midwicket off the back foot

12.4,"Ali to Williamson, no run","full at off stump, gets forward and pats it back to the bowler"
12.3,"Ali to Williamson, no run",beaten on the cut. Short of a length and sliding through rapidly as KW jumps into he leg side to make room for the cut
12.2,"Ali to Williamson, no run",good length and turning in at off stump. Gets forward and defends
12.1,"Ali to Williamson, 2 runs",short and turning into leg stump. Pulled along the ground to deep midwicket's right
11.6,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven to long-off with the turn"
11.5,"Chahal to Garg, OUT","chipped straight to sweeper cover! Implosion. Looked like he was prepared to play out this period, but Garg has looked to launch Chahal over extra cover off the front foot.That is one of the most difficult shots to attempt against Chahal, who has mastered the dipping legbreak outside off in limited-overs cricket. Garg is nowhere near the pitch of it and the other leggie completes the job after running to his right"
11.4,"Chahal to Garg, no run",short of a length and sliding on in the corridor. Whipped to short midwicket off the back foot
11.3,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run",full and slow at middle stump. Leans in and drives with the turn to long-off

10.3,"Zampa to Williamson, 1 run","full and into leg stump, gets to the pitch and drives to long-on"
10.3,"Zampa to Williamson, 1 wide","slider at a length, down leg side and past the attempted glance"
10.2,"Zampa to Williamson, no run","full and into leg stump, flicked to midwicket"
10.1,"Zampa to Williamson, no run",past the outside edge. Woof. Zampa has landed them perfectly tonight. Dipping at a good length and turning past the forward block outside off
9.6,"Chahal to Garg, 2 runs","short and just outside off, cut to point's right and a fumble there"
9.5,"Chahal to Garg, no run",good length and back to the dipping ball outside off. Driven back at the bowler
9.4,"Chahal to Garg, 2 runs",full and pushed through quicker this time. And he's nicely to the pitch of this as he drives to sweeper's right
9.3,"Chahal to Garg, no run","googly at a length outside off, blocked on the front foot"
9.2,"Chahal to Garg, no run",good length and drawing him forward with some lovely loop at off stump. He's not to the pitch as he looks to drive and it's off the thick outside edge to extra cover
9.1,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to sweeper's right off the back foot"
8.6,"Zampa to Garg, no run","good length and turning away from off stump, defended off the back foot to extra cover"
8.5,"Zampa to Garg, no run",inside edge onto pad as he looks to force this through cover off the front foot. It spun back in from a length outside off stump
8.4,"Zampa to Garg, no run","full and just outside off, driven back to the bowler"
8.3,"Zampa to Pandey, OUT","no doubt about this one! Short of a length and sliding on outside off. Pandey is still moving into the leg side as he reaches out to stab for a single through cover. That's a clear edge, and catch number three for AB de Villiers"
8.2,"Zampa to Pandey, no run","full at off stump, looks to drive through cover, gets it to midwicket off the inside half"
8.1,"Zampa to Williamson, 1 run","full and dipping at leg stump, leans in and drives off the toe-end to long-on"
7.6,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run",good length and sliding on outside off. Punched to point's right off the back foot

6.1,"Zampa to Williamson, no run","good length and just outside off, defended on the front foot"
5.6,"Siraj to Williamson, 1 leg bye","good length and into the pads, uses the angle and nudges that towards fine leg"
5.5,"Siraj to Williamson, 4 leg byes",short of a length and rising up at the hip. Pulls out late from his attempted glance and that's pinged fine off the thigh guard
5.4,"Siraj to Warner, OUT","appeal for catch behind as Warner is cramped. Kohli reviews. Short of a length and into his body as he's skipping down leg side again. There is a sound as it goes through. AB lunges low to his right to cover the angle of Siraj being around the wicket. He didn't seem convinced. It's definitely got a part of Warner's body. But did it hit glove before that? Early pictures on Ultra Edge suggest that it might have. Disturbance as the ball goes past his glove. challenge for the umpire is to determine whether that's trouser or glove and he'll have to check purely on visuals for that. For gaps and light. The ball is right in between the glove's edge and where the abdomen guard would be. ""I can see the ball is touching the gloves here,"" he says. So that will be out. The debate will be - if it took that long, was there enough conclusive evidence to overturn it? He sounded confident by the end of it. It seemed based purely on the spikes on Ultra Edge."
5.3,"Siraj to Warner, no run",short of a length and just outside off. Under-edge on the attempted cut
5.2,"Siraj to Warner, FOUR runs","short and pushed across the corridor, waits on it and cuts late to beat sweeper to his right"
5.1,"Siraj to Warner, FOUR runs",slashed over the covers. That's taken some contortion. Short ball with not a lot of room outside off. He skips into the leg side and is briefly aerial as he also arches back to make room for a cut. Then he slashes from under it
4.6,"Sundar to Warner, 1 run","short of a length and into leg stump, nudged to deep square off the back foot"
4.5,"Sundar to Warner, no run","short of a length at off stump, backs away and punches to extra cover"
4.4,"Sundar to Pandey, 1 run","good length outside off, leans in and pushes to mid-off"
4.3,"Sundar to Pandey, FOUR runs","punched past mid-off again. Short of a length outside off, gets deep in the crease and times the punch to perfection, no fuss"
4.2,"Sundar to Warner, 1 run",good length outside off. Drags that from well outside off. Thick inside edge to midwicket's left. Midwicket slips and does well to stop the ball as it threatens to trickle past him. Wonder if that is the dew
4.2,"Sundar to Warner, (no ball)","short and just outside off, cut to cover off the back foot. As he makes connection, the stumps are broken. It's just AB's gloves. Which could mean a no-ball. They're sending it up. Yes, it is a no-ball. Stumps broken before shot offered."
4.1,"Sundar to Warner, FOUR runs",short of a length and sliding into the corridor. Gets the front leg into the leg side and chops this between cover and extra
3.6,"Saini to Pandey, FOUR runs","sweet timing on the drive. Full ball just outside off, keeps the stride away, stays leg side and this is all hands - full face of the bat comes down before a slight opening as he's about to make connection. Gets it to mid-off's left"
3.5,"Saini to Pandey, no run","short of a length in the corridor, defended to point off the back foot"
3.4,"Saini to Warner, 1 run",short of a length just outside off. Short-arm pull as that hurries onto the corridor. Midwicket parries it to his right after a dive
3.3,"Saini to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length at leg stump, swiped to fine leg off the thick inside edge"
3.2,"Saini to Pandey, no run","good length on off stump, patted back towards the bowler"
3.1,"Saini to Pandey, FOUR runs","through from under Dube. Length ball outside off, half a stride out and a swing across the line. Floats towards Dube, landing in front of him and then nutmegging him as he goes down inelegantly"
2.6,"Siraj to Warner, no run",short of a length and at off stump. Backs away and chops to point
2.5,"Siraj to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length outside off, backs away and chops to third man"
2.4,"Siraj to Pandey, SIX runs","pulled neatly over midwicket. One of his favourites. Short ball outside off, stays tall and swishes through the line for a sweet connection. On the front foot for it"
2.3,"Siraj to Pandey, no run",inside edge onto pad. Length ball jags in as he gets on the back foot and looks to turn that into midwicket
2.2,"Siraj to Pandey, no run","good length and just outside off, defended to point off the back foot"
2.1,"Siraj to Pandey, no run",good length and wobbling in the corridor. Pandey unsure about that as he stays leg side and jabs into the off side
2.1,"Siraj to Pandey, 1 wide","short of a length and down leg side, past the attempted glance"
2.1,"Siraj to Pandey, 1 wide","good length and down leg side, left alone"
1.6,"Saini to Warner, no run","good length at off stump, defended down the pitch"
1.5,"Saini to Warner, no run","good length and tight at middle stump, defended off the back foot"
1.4,"Saini to Warner, no run","good length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
1.3,"Saini to Pandey, 1 run",just short of third man. Short and in the corridor. Stays leg side of it and looks to steer that past slip. Nearly lifts that to the fielder
1.2,"Saini to Warner, 1 run",good length and in the corridor. Waits on that and jabs to third man's left
1.1,"Saini to Warner, no run","good length at off stump, defended into the off side off the back foot"
0.6,"Siraj to Pandey, no run","short of a length in the corridor, gets on top of that and tucks it into midwicket off the back foot"
0.5,"Siraj to Pandey, no run","length and curving away in the corridor, defended with a closed face"
0.4,"Siraj to Goswami, OUT",a wobble but AB takes that. Good length and pushed across the corridor. Clears the front leg and has a slash at it. Thin edge that dips on AB like a football struck from distance. Keeps his eyes on it and hangs on. Siraj lets out a screech that echoes in the ground
0.3,"Siraj to Goswami, no run","short of a length just outside off, punched into the covers off the back foot"
0.2,"Siraj to Goswami, no run",short of a length and coming in at the corridor. Watchfully left alone
0.1,"Siraj to Warner, 1 run",short of a length and into off stump. Dropped to cover's right off the back foot with soft hands
0.1,"Siraj to Warner, 1 wide",good length and wide outside off. Searching for some swing. This goes straight on and is left alone
19.6,"Natarajan to Siraj, 2 runs","yorker at middle stump, jammed along the floor to deep midwicket"
19.5,"Natarajan to Siraj, FOUR runs","gets it away this time! Full and just outside off, drops the right shoulder and gets into the off side and then jabs at it to get it to the keeper's left"
19.4,"Natarajan to Siraj, 2 runs",just over short third. Slower ball at a length following him as he walks into the off side. He was looking to ramp that towards fine leg
19.3,"Natarajan to Saini, 1 run","low full toss outside off, driven to extra cover off the toe-end"
19.2,"Natarajan to Saini, FOUR runs",slashed over point. Length and across him again. Manages to get bat on it this time after throwing his hands at it
19.1,"Natarajan to Saini, no run","cutter at a good length, away from the corridor, and beaten on the swish"
18.6,"Holder to Saini, 1 run","full at middle stump, clears the front foot and gets the slog along the ground to long-on"
18.5,"Holder to Siraj, 1 run","yorker at middle stump, squeezed into midwicket off the thick inside edge"
18.4,"Holder to Siraj, no run","bouncer at a leg stump line, backs into the leg side and swipes, well beaten"
18.3,"Holder to Saini, 1 run","full and in at middle stump. Swings for midwicket, gets an inside edge to fine leg"
18.2,"Holder to Siraj, 1 run","short and in at off stump, opens the face and runs it to third man"
18.1,"Holder to Saini, 1 run",slower short one at leg stump. Half-ducks and then fends this towards short fine
17.6,"Natarajan to Siraj, no run","full and outside off, swings into the leg side, beaten on the outside edge"
17.5,"Natarajan to AB, OUT","knocks out his middle stump! Oh boy, talk about a memorable ball. What a story, this man. Uncomplicated as ever, full and at the stumps. AB has the front leg out of the way trying to drill that through midwicket. It's snuck under him and sent the stumps rolling. It's cross-seam, it's angled across from an initial leg-stump line. And it's done one of the best"
17.4,"Natarajan to Saini, 1 run","short at off stump, arches into the leg side and chops to third man's right"
17.3,"Natarajan to Saini, no run","yorker at middle stump, squeezed straight out to midwicket"
17.2,"Natarajan to AB, 1 run","just short of long-on as Warner charges in to make sure there's no chance of a second. Slower ball, it appears. At a length at middle stump and getting big on his attempted slog"
17.1,"Natarajan to Sundar, OUT","steered straight to sweeper cover. Decent connection on that, to be fair. But the placement not quite there. It's a full ball outside off, he hangs leg side of that and opens the face late to try and get that over point possibly. Samad runs in and takes this as it dips into his mid-riff"
16.6,"Sandeep to AB, 2 runs","yorker at middle stump, clears the front leg and jams it to long-on's right"
16.5,"Sandeep to Sundar, 1 run","full and just outside off, clears the front leg and gets a good hit at this cover drive. Can only find sweeper cover"
16.4,"Sandeep to AB, 1 run",good length and sliding on at middle stump. Punched down to long-on
16.3,"Sandeep to Sundar, 1 run",good length and at middle stump. Punched back to the bowler whose momentum in the follow through means his fumble ends up at long-off
16.2,"Sandeep to Sundar, no run","good length and just outside off, punched on the up to extra cover"
16.1,"Sandeep to Sundar, 2 runs","good length on leg stump, whipped to deep midwicket's left off the back foot"
15.6,"Holder to AB, FOUR runs",brings up fifty with a calm whip to long-on's right. It's a low full toss on leg stump and he leans in and makes full use of that. No chance for the fielder
15.5,"Holder to Sundar, 1 run","short of a length outside off, stays leg side of that and steers to third man"
15.4,"Holder to Dubey, OUT",leading edge is taken by mid-off. It's wicket number three for Holder. Full and at leg stump. Looks like a slight roll of the fingers from Holder too. Dube looking to stab that through midwicket and closes the face too early. Warner runs in and holds that
15.4,"Holder to Dubey, 1 wide","full and wide outside off, left alone"
15.3,"Holder to Dubey, 2 runs",short and up at chest height on a middle stump line. Pulls this to long-on's left and Garg is quick to get across and put in a slide
15.2,"Holder to AB, 1 run","yorker at middle stump, looks to whip into the leg side and gets it onto his boot"
15.1,"Holder to AB, 2 runs","yorker outside off, shuffles and chops to third deep backward point"
14.6,"Rashid Khan to Dubey, no run","googly at a length on leg stump, turning away and headed towards off. He follows with his hands and pokes it into the covers"
14.5,"Rashid Khan to AB, 1 run","googly, short of a length and into off stump. Inside edge through midwicket as he looks for the cut"
14.4,"Rashid Khan to AB, FOUR runs","oh lovely.  Googly outside off, and he's quickly down for the sweep once again. Watches it closely, gets inside the line and uses his wrists to shovel this to the vacant long leg boundary"
14.3,"Rashid Khan to AB, 2 runs","short of a length and just outside off, backs away and cuts to sweeper's left"
14.2,"Rashid Khan to AB, no run","beaten on the sweep. Full legbreak outside off, gets down on a knee to whip that through square"
14.1,"Rashid Khan to Dubey, 1 run","good length and sliding on outside off. Looks for the slog sweep, thick inside edge to short fine"
13.6,"Natarajan to Dubey, 1 run","yorker at middle stump, squeezed into midwicket"
13.5,"Natarajan to Dubey, no run","bouncer down at a leg stump line, sways out of the way to let that go"
13.4,"Natarajan to AB, 1 run","good length at middle stump, nudge to long-on"
13.3,"Natarajan to AB, 2 runs","length and just outside off, mistimed pt down to long-off"
13.2,"Natarajan to AB, FOUR runs","creamed to sweeper's right. Full and floaty, wide outside off. Gets the front leg into the leg side to open up some swinging room and then drives handsomely"

12.6,"Nadeem to AB, no run","short of a length on off stump, punched to extra cover off the back foot"

12.2,"Nadeem to AB, 1 run","length and at the stumps, punched to long-on"
12.1,"Nadeem to AB, FOUR runs","misfield at long-on. Short of a length and sliding into him. Short-arm pull to long-on's right. Holder has completely mistimed his effort to the right. Gets his feet in a tangle, manages only to get his right hand out at it and tumbles over"
11.6,"Rashid Khan to Dubey, no run","short of a length and turning into leg stump, whipped to midwicket off the back foot"
11.5,"Rashid Khan to Dubey, no run",nearly chops on again. Short of a length and coming back into him. An angled bat and past off stump again. Once again Rashid asks about the lbw and is turned down. Replays suggest that was pad first
11.4,"Rashid Khan to Dubey, no run","chopped into the pitch. Playing for the googly as he's rooted on the back foot, but this spins back in and he nearly chops it on. Rashid with the lbw appeal, bat was close to pad"
11.3,"Rashid Khan to AB, 1 run","length at off stump, leans in and clips through vacant midwicket"
11.2,"Rashid Khan to Dubey, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven into the covers with the turn on that googly"

10.5,"Nadeem to AB, 2 runs","short of a length outside off, chopped to sweeper's left"
10.4,"Nadeem to Ali, OUT","no Rashid, it's a free hit for Moeen, not you! A smooth pick up and throw from his left at extra cover to knock out the stumps at the non-striker's end. Moeen is at three yards out, not even in close enough to attempt a dive or a slide of the bat. It was a full ball fired outside off, cleared the front leg, hit it straight to extra and took off. It was hit too well to pinch a run. A golden duck off a free hit ball, write that one down, all you quizmasters"
10.4,"Nadeem to AB, (no ball) 1 run","into the stumps and whipped out to deep midwicket. The siren goes off, he's overstepped."
10.3,"Nadeem to AB, FOUR runs",outside edge sprints past short third. Short of a length and sliding on in the corridor. Backed away and chucked his hands at that with the punch. Caught inside the line a little and that's his first boundary. Also RCB's first non-Finch boundary of the night
10.2,"Nadeem to Finch, OUT","taken at sweeper cover. Full outside off. Having followed him down leg side all this while, he hangs this one up full and away from Finch. He reaches out and looks to clear extra. But he's arching back and really swishing hard to try and make connection. Off the low part and floats out for Samad, who runs and takes it about halfway in"
10.1,"Nadeem to AB, 1 run","tossed up at middle stump, backs into the leg side and drives to long-off"
10.1,"Nadeem to AB, 1 wide","good length and wide outside off, left alone"

9.3,"Rashid Khan to Finch, no run","full outside off, driven to extra cover"
9.2,"Rashid Khan to Finch, SIX runs","nails the slog sweep. First boundary stroke since the powerplay.  It's a quicker one outside off, sliding into him, and he gets down early and uses the angle to his advantage with a clean swing"
9.1,"Rashid Khan to AB, 1 run","good length outside off, lashed off the front foot to sweeper cover"
8.6,"Nadeem to AB, 1 run","short of a length and sliding in, low, at the stumps. Hurriedly chopped to point's right off the back foot"

8.1,"Nadeem to Finch, 1 run","slow and short of a length, into leg stump. Punched to long-on off the back foot"
7.6,"Rashid Khan to Finch, 1 run",oh close. Short of a length googly headed menacingly for off stump as Finch takes a walk down leg side. Just manages to get the under-edge on the cut
7.5,"Rashid Khan to Finch, no run","short and just outside off, cut straight to short third man"
7.4,"Rashid Khan to Finch, no run","slider, quick and short of a length and down leg side. He was shaping for the pull and copped that on the front pad. Outside leg stump. Lbw appeal turned down by umpire and then Warner"
7.3,"Rashid Khan to Finch, no run","short of a length outside off, gets low for the ramp and it's off the pad to midwicket after an inside edge"
7.2,"Rashid Khan to AB, 1 run","full outside off, reaches out and drills it along the ground to sweeper"
7.1,"Rashid Khan to AB, no run","googly, short of a length and cramping him at leg stump. Pushed back down the pitch"

5.6,"Natarajan to Finch, FOUR runs","squeezed past backward point. Length and just outside off. Hangs deep in the crease and opens the face late as he sets up for a back foot punch. Opens it enough to get four, as third man is in the circle"
5.5,"Natarajan to AB, 1 run",good length and tight at middle stump. Full face offered as he punches this to mid-off's right
5.4,"Natarajan to Finch, 1 run","good length on middle stump, flicked to deep square"

5.1,"Natarajan to AB, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, onto the back foot to punch to sweeper cover"
4.6,"Sandeep to Finch, FOUR runs","short of a length and just outside off. Waits on that deep in the crease and punches it well in front of square, to extra cover's left"

3.4,"Holder to AB, no run","good length and swung away wide outside off, left alone"
3.3,"Holder to Padikkal, OUT","hauled to midwicket. No signs so far that the ball is coming onto the bat smoothly. Holder gets another one to climb, this one is just short of a length. And it's at Padikkal's stomach. He's backed into the leg side and tried to pull that, but it's off the high part of that bat and floating above Garg. It's not come at pace and these can get tricky if you don't time the jump right. Garg does it perfectly and lands with some grace"
3.2,"Holder to Finch, 1 run",short of a length and rising in the corridor. Gets on top of the bounce and dabs it to point's right
3.1,"Holder to Finch, FOUR runs",short of a length and climbing into the hips. Stays deep in the crease and uses the angle to swipe that to deep square's right with his front leg raised

1.4,"Holder to Finch, no run",good length and in at middle stump. Defended uppishly into the covers with hard hands and static feet
1.4,"Holder to Finch, 1 wide",pushed down leg side
1.3,"Holder to Finch, no run","short of a length outside off, tapped into the covers"
1.2,"Holder to Kohli, OUT","appeal for catch behind and it's given! Kohli is taken down leg side by Goswami. Good length ball rises inwards as Kohli walks down at it outside off. he likes doing that to open up the leg side, but this gets big on him. It gets his glove, his thigh, and then Goswami lunges to take that to his left. Kohli was walking"
1.1,"Holder to Kohli, 2 runs","good length and some shape away outside off, jumps into the line of that and clips it to mid-on's right"
0.6,"Sandeep to Kohli, 1 run",short of a length and curved into the corridor. Stays inside the line and opens the face to steer that to third man

19.6,"Pollard to Rabada, 1 wide",wide outside leg this time
19.6,"Pollard to Rabada, 1 wide","slower ball, wide outside off"
19.5,"Pollard to Axar Patel, OUT","Chahar takes it on the fourth take. Big laugh on Rohit's face. Slower ball, Patel toe-ends a skier, and Chahar nearly drops this running to his right from deep midwicket. Massive juggling act but he finishes a catch that should cheer him up a little"
19.4,"Pollard to Rabada, 1 run","massive slower ball, and he toe-ends it to long-off for one"
19.3,"Pollard to Rabada, FOUR runs","Rabada having some fun here, driving this length ball back over his head for four"
19.2,"Pollard to Rabada, FOUR runs","quick bouncer, he gets inside the line and pulls this to the left of deep square for four"
19.2,"Pollard to Rabada, 1 wide","bouncer, outside leg, called a wide"
19.1,"Pollard to Rabada, 2 runs","slower short ball, and the big fast bowler Coulter-Nile dives full length at short fine leg to try to catch this. I wouldn't be doing this if I was the big fast bowler and risking an injury"
18.6,"Coulter-Nile to Rabada, 1 run","full toss, on the higher side, driven to long-on for one. Just under the waist, the umpires rule"
18.5,"Coulter-Nile to Axar Patel, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to long-off for one"

18.3,"Coulter-Nile to Axar Patel, 1 wide","goes full and wide, bowls too wide"
18.2,"Coulter-Nile to Axar Patel, SIX runs","Axar keeps showing his batting wares. Coulter-Nile digs this in, and gets it high too, but Patel has pulled this way above forward square leg"

17.6,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, nudged for one into the leg side"
17.5,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, no run","short of a length, outside off, seams away a long way. Beaten"
17.4,"Bumrah to Rabada, 1 run","and he has let Rabada off. The bouncer gets big on him, the top edge falls short of point, and the fielder allows him to get off with an overthrow"
17.3,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, 1 run","short of a length, tucked away off the hip for one"
17.2,"Bumrah to Axar Patel, no run","defended to short straight midwicket. Bumrah wants a wicket or, failing that, a single  so he can go after Rabada"

16.4,"Coulter-Nile to Axar Patel, 1 run","that falls bang in the middle and short third man and cover running towards it. This short ball gets a bit big, and he escapes"

16.1,"Coulter-Nile to Axar Patel, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, pulled to deep midwicket"
15.6,"Bumrah to Rabada, no run","two double-wicket maidens in the same T20 innings. This is just too good. Rabada not good enough to edge it. Short of a length, leaving him against the angle, and just misses the edge"

15.4,"Bumrah to Rabada, no run","bouncer again, and he ducks it"
15.3,"Bumrah to Sams, OUT","and Bumrah has another. Another bouncer. This one is sharoer and at Sams. He tries to get inside the line and help it along, but all he manages is a glove through to de Kock"
15.2,"Bumrah to Sams, no run","bouncer, outside off, and he doesn't get close to its line and sways away"
15.1,"Bumrah to Stoinis, OUT","and Bumrah has killed this game too soon. Oh what a killjoy. But also what joy to watch him bowl. Quick length ball, nips back off the seam, but he has also done Stoinis for the pace. Middle stump gone for a walk. This is just too good"
14.6,"Pollard to Stoinis, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, short-arm pull. Just the single to deep square"
14.5,"Pollard to Axar Patel, 1 run","slower ball, just short of that slot, punched to deep cover for one"
14.4,"Pollard to Axar Patel, SIX runs","lovely clean strike. Capitals realise there is no Boult, and they are going after Pollard. This is on-pace and in the slot, and he shuffles across to get close to it and lofts him back over his had"
14.3,"Pollard to Axar Patel, no run","Pollard goes even slower but shorter, and beats him on the pull"
14.2,"Pollard to Axar Patel, SIX runs","he has picked the bones out of a Pollard slower ball. He is sitting back and waiting for it, and slogs this length ball over midwicket. Half the target achieved"

13.1,"Coulter-Nile to Axar Patel, FOUR runs","wide length ball, Axar stands tall and drives this on the up, between mid-off and extra cover. Along the ground"
12.6,"Chahar to Stoinis, no run","shapes up for the big hit again, but Chahar gets his length right on the fast legbreak. He has to defend this to cover"
12.5,"Chahar to Axar Patel, 1 run","short of a length, tucked away off the hip for one"
12.4,"Chahar to Axar Patel, FOUR runs","full, on the toes, clipped between long-on and deep midwicket, and Pollard misfields there. Is this the dew at work? Has he failed to guague the speed of the ball"
12.3,"Chahar to Stoinis, 1 run","quick lerbreak, on a length, well outside leg, then turning towards the wicket. Pushed towards deep midwicket for one"
12.2,"Chahar to Stoinis, FOUR runs","legbreak, short of a length, Stoinis lets this turn and cuts this between point and cover-point for four more"
12.1,"Chahar to Stoinis, SIX runs","Chahar bowls short of a length, and flat, and Stoinis rocks back to pull this over wide long-on"
11.6,"Krunal to Stoinis, 1 run","bouncer, and de Kock is expecting it. This is the second such Krunal has bowled in the last two matches. Anyway, Stoinis pulls this down for a single"
11.5,"Krunal to Axar Patel, 1 run","really slow, angling across him, punched to deep cover for one"
11.4,"Krunal to Stoinis, 1 run",gets to his fifty with a quick single as he hasn't bunted this too far off Pandya. He misses with the direct hit
11.3,"Krunal to Stoinis, FOUR runs","another yorker, but this time Stoinis cues it fine of third man for four. Can't have been intended. Not entirely"
11.2,"Krunal to Stoinis, no run",and now he bowls a 110ks yorker outside off. de Kock does well to stop this
11.1,"Krunal to Stoinis, no run","on a length, no room, punched to cover"
10.6,"Pollard to Axar Patel, no run","wide length ball, but just inside that wide line. Axar leaves it alone thinking this will be called but Pollard is pinpoint with his accuracy"
10.5,"Pollard to Axar Patel, no run","short of a length, on-pace, punched to extra cover"
10.4,"Pollard to Axar Patel, no run","wide on the crease, down the leg side, and it is slow so the edge doesn't carry to the keeper. de Kock immediately says it hasn't carried even as Pollard is excited about it"

9.3,"Krunal to Stoinis, 1 run","slow through the air, on a length, middle and leg, punched down to long-on for one"
9.2,"Krunal to Axar Patel, 1 run",driven to long-on this time for one
9.1,"Krunal to Axar Patel, no run","quick, straight, on a length, pushed back to him"
8.6,"Chahar to Stoinis, SIX runs","lovely shot. This has been the trick of Chahar and Chahal. When under the pump, they bowl loopy slow wide legbreaks, and batsmen fall for it. Stoinis, though, much like Surya did to Chahal the other day, goes over extra cover instead of down the ground, and gets six for it"
8.5,"Chahar to Axar Patel, 1 run","quick and full, worked into the leg side for one"
8.4,"Chahar to Stoinis, 1 run","short of a length, turning away, punched to deep cover for one"
8.3,"Chahar to Stoinis, SIX runs","that is Samson-like. Chahar overpitches outside off, and he just extends his arms through it to loft him over long-off for a huge six"
8.2,"Chahar to Stoinis, FOUR runs","short, quick, hurried into the pull, but there is no deep midwicket in place"
8.1,"Chahar to Axar Patel, 1 run","legbreak, Axar goes back to work this behind square on the leg side for one"
7.6,"Krunal to Axar Patel, 1 run","straight length ball, worked to leg for one"
7.5,"Krunal to Pant, OUT","and Bumrah won't be required to get Pant out today. Krunal angles this wide, Pant sets himself up for the slog sweep, but instead of turning in, this actually angles furhter away, and all he manages is a toe-end to long-on"
7.4,"Krunal to Stoinis, 1 run","full, just outside leg, inside-edged to deep midwicket for one"
7.3,"Krunal to Stoinis, no run","slower in the air, straight, on a length, defended back to him"

5.5,"Coulter-Nile to Stoinis, 2 runs","short of a length, into the body, short-arm pull forward of deep square, and Anukul Roy - how does he spend so much time on the field? - makes a diving save"

5.3,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, no run","on a length, on off, defended to cover"

5.1,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, no run","a wide length ball, he toe-ends the drive"
4.6,"Krunal to Stoinis, no run","another quick length ball, punched to cover-point"
4.5,"Krunal to Stoinis, no run","quick, on a length, punched to cover"
4.4,"Krunal to Stoinis, FOUR runs","dropped by brother Hardik. Krunal had earned this wicket with his tight bowling and then the length ball to cramp Stoinis up. He hits this just over mid-on, Hardik has to time his jump, but he fails to do that. It slips through for four"
4.4,"Krunal to Stoinis, 1 wide","looks for the wide yorker, goes too wide"
4.3,"Krunal to Stoinis, no run","full and quick, Stoinis backs away to punch this, but can't beat cover"

4.1,"Krunal to Stoinis, no run","flat length ball, punched to cover"
3.6,"Bumrah to Pant, no run",oh nearly a repeat of the last dismissal with this angling in from round the wicket and hitting his pad. Except this time it is going down
3.5,"Bumrah to Iyer, OUT","and they have got what they wanted. That extra wicket. Hit straight to cover. You could call this unfortunate and all but Iyer has played away from the body and neither not looked to keep this down nor tries to clear the infielder. Just throws his hands at a wide length ball, and Rohit takes the catch at short cover"
3.4,"Bumrah to Iyer, FOUR runs",lovely shot. Driven on the up as Bumrah bowls this length ball wide. Crashes this past extra cover for four
3.3,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run","on a length, angling in, worked to square leg for one"
3.2,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run","slightly short of a length, straight at him, pushed to mid-on"
3.1,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run","quick length ball, defended off the back foot"
2.6,"Boult to Iyer, no run","on a length, angling across, driven to cover"
2.5,"Boult to Iyer, FOUR runs","shuffles across, then backs away, as he usually does, and cuts Boult's attempted bouncer over cover-point"
2.4,"Boult to Iyer, FOUR runs","Iyer has to keep going. Boult goes a touch too full looking for swing, and he lofts him over mid-on for four"
2.3,"Boult to Iyer, no run","short of a length, just outside off, pushed to point"
2.2,"Boult to Iyer, no run","on a length, slight seam/cut away from leg stump. Squares him up a little. Pushes this back to him"
2.1,"Boult to Stoinis, 1 run","uppish as he pushes at this length ball, and it goes wide of point for one"
1.6,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, worked to leg for one"
1.5,"Bumrah to Stoinis, FOUR runs","looks for the yoekr, misses his mark, and Stoinis flicks this half-volley off this toes for a four to square leg"

1.4,"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 wide","bouncer, and they get off the mark with a wide"
1.3,"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run","short of a length, punched sweetly, but straight to cover"
1.2,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, OUT","ladies and gentleman. If you ever want to see domination, this is what it looks like. Lose the toss, ask to bat, score 200, and reduce the opposition to nought for three. Swinging quick yorker. Searing and moving. Traps him lbw first on the toe, and then breaks his off stump. Bowled takes precedence here"
1.1,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length, no room, punched to cover"
0.6,"Boult to Iyer, no run","double-wicket maiden to start off with when defending 200. Hardly gets better. Short of a length, pushed to pint, and Kishan has hurt himself trying to deny them the single they are not even serious about"
0.5,"Boult to Rahane, OUT","bashes the front pad this time. When they were looking for swing, he bowled across them. Now he has drawn Rahane across twice, and has bowled the late inswinger to trap him in front. In an otherwise powerful attack, when you can't afford to see Boult off, this guy is a menace. And he is shrewd to go with his skills"
0.4,"Boult to Rahane, no run","on a length, around off, pushed to cover"
0.3,"Boult to Rahane, no run","on a length, slight swing, defended solidly off the front foot"
0.2,"Boult to Shaw, OUT","this is such clever bowling. Shaw is looking for that inswinger, his feet are not going across, and Boult has not given him the inswinger. He has bowled on an angle. And with feet unsure, his hands push at it, and it takes the edge. What's more? It is a cutter, meant to go across. Clever clever bowling"
0.1,"Boult to Shaw, no run","no swing. Short of a length, just outside off, defended"
19.6,"Nortje to Ishan, SIX runs","and 200 it will be. Nortje bowls a wide full toss, he goes deep in the crease, his front leg is in the air in an effort to generate power, and he clears extra cover. The six race between Kishan and Pandya is well and truly hot and on"
19.5,"Nortje to Pandya, 1 bye","slower ball, hard length, beats his pull, and they take the bye as Pant fumbles. No ego from Pandya sending Kishan back"
19.4,"Nortje to Pandya, SIX runs","goes wide yorker again, bowls a full toss, and Pandya goes across to loft him over long-off for another six. This is such efficient risk-free six-hitting. He is playing within himself, guys"
19.3,"Nortje to Pandya, SIX runs","that is a nothing ball. Slower ball, in the slot, and you are not beating this power hitter with such full slower ones. He drills this over long-on for six"
19.2,"Nortje to Pandya, no run","goes wide yorker, bowls a low wide full toss, but Pandya gets only the toe end"
19.1,"Nortje to Ishan, 1 run","Nortje bowls the slower yorker wide outside off, and he gets just the single to deep midwicket"
18.6,"Rabada to Ishan, 1 run","Rabada follows him again, and this time he helicopters this low full toss flat to deep midwicket for one"
18.5,"Rabada to Ishan, FOUR runs","oh he has picked his spot perfectly here. He knows mid-off is up so he is making room early and wants only enough power to clear mid-off. Rabada follows him, cramps him up, and he doesn't clear mid-off, but has put this wide of the man"
18.4,"Rabada to Pandya, 1 run","the yorker nailed again, and he can only dig it out for a single to long-off"
18.3,"Rabada to Pandya, no run","gets the yorker right, and he digs it out back to Rabada"
18.2,"Rabada to Pandya, SIX runs","slower ball, short of a length, but Pandya generates great power on the slog and goes flat over midwicket. Scary batting"
18.1,"Rabada to Pandya, SIX runs","misses the yorrker by a foot, and Pandya flicks this from the slot. Not a massive follow-through, but big muscle and timing. Clears long-on"
17.6,"Sams to Ishan, SIX runs",slower balls worked for him so far but Sams doesn't want to be too predictable and bowls one-pace. Except that he gets the length wrong and bowls in the slot. Kishan slogs this over wide long-on for a flat low six
17.5,"Sams to Pandya, 1 run","full and wide, and would have been called had Pandya not reached out and toe-ended it to long-off for one"
17.4,"Sams to Ishan, 1 run","slower length ball, he picks it late, and gets just the single to long-on"
17.3,"Sams to Pandya, 1 run","yorker, down the leg side, pushed to deep midwicket for one"
17.2,"Sams to Pandya, 2 runs","sees him walk down, bowls the slower one, and it runs off the inside edge for a couple to long leg"
17.1,"Sams to Pandya, SIX runs","yorker gone wrong. Full toss into the pads, flicked away nonchalantly over square leg"
16.6,"Stoinis to Ishan, no run","full and wide, squeezes it under his bat. What an over. Forced to bowl the 17th because the match-up is not ideal for the specialist spinner, and he takes a wicket and concedes no boundary"
16.5,"Stoinis to Ishan, 2 runs","short, not too wide, cut in the air and in front of square. Gets a two. Pandya not at his sprightliest when running"
16.4,"Stoinis to Pandya, 1 run","full toss down the leg side, but Pandya just pushes this to deep square for one"
16.3,"Stoinis to Ishan, 1 run","short and not too wide, gets big on Kishan, and he mis-hits it over mid-off for one"
16.2,"Stoinis to Pandya, 1 run","wide length ball, he shuffles across to push this straight of extra cover and wide of mid-off for one"
16.1,"Stoinis to Krunal, OUT","wide length ball, and he does well to drag this out of his reach. Pandya looks to drive it over extra cover, but this goes off the toe end as he has a long way to reach. Caught at deep point. Golden arm eh"
15.6,"Nortje to Ishan, FOUR runs","short of a length, angling in, he plays this late and absolutely deliberately, placing this fine of third man"
15.5,"Nortje to Krunal, 1 run","on a length, looks to slog, gets an inside edge and they steal a single to midwicket"
15.4,"Nortje to Krunal, SIX runs","into the second tier again. Krunal Pandya into the act now. Bouncer from Nortje, Pandya doesn't hold back even though this is too high to control. It sails over long leg"
15.3,"Nortje to Ishan, 1 run","on a length, no room, slogged to deep midwicket for one"
15.2,"Nortje to Ishan, FOUR runs","low full toss, 148ks, on the toes, and not only does he get his toes out of the way, he jabs at it and scoops it straight of deep square leg for four"
15.1,"Nortje to Ishan, 2 runs","short of a length, tucked off the hip, fine of fine leg for a couple"
14.6,"Rabada to Ishan, 1 run",another big pull but doesn't get all of it. Will take the single
14.5,"Rabada to Ishan, SIX runs","it doesn't matter where the fielder is this time. Rabada bowls short, Not even chest-high, and he has pulled this into the second tier behind square leg"
14.4,"Rabada to Ishan, FOUR runs","again the short ball gets big on him, but the mis-hit carries past midwicket in the circle. And the boundary rider is square for Kishan. So this rolls into the fence. Ends a drought for Mumbai"
14.3,"Rabada to Krunal, 1 run",mis-hits this as he goes across to try to hit over midwicket. He has mis-hit it enough for it not to carry to the boundary rider
14.2,"Rabada to Ishan, 1 run","looks to play the pick-up pull, mis-hits this short-of-a-length ball for a single to deep square leg"
14.1,"Rabada to Krunal, 1 run","on a length, angling in, runs off the inside half of the bat for one"
13.6,"Sams to Krunal, 1 run","slower offcutter, he looks to run this down, but is cramped up and hit on the glove. They get a single, though"
13.5,"Sams to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched down to long-on for one"
13.4,"Sams to Ishan, no run","slower ball, cuts back in, cramps him up, hit back to Sams"
13.3,"Sams to Krunal, 1 run","short, pulled down, gets a single to deep square leg"
13.2,"Sams to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length, on-pace, punched down to long-on for one"
13.1,"Sams to Krunal, 1 run","on a length, outside off, pushed with an open face. A fumble at point gives them a single"
12.6,"Ashwin to Krunal, 1 run","really slow in the air, middle and leg, driven with soft hands down to long-on for one"
12.5,"Ashwin to Krunal, no run","flat length ball, no room, defended with an open face"
12.4,"Ashwin to Ishan, 1 run","full, middle and leg, driven to long-on"
12.3,"Ashwin to Ishan, no run","on a length, dipping, on off, defended with an open face"
12.2,"Ashwin to Pollard, OUT","a loud shout of come on from Ashwin as he has Pollard caught at long-on. This is a carrom ball, but he has overpitched it. No turn on it, but Pollard's bottom hand comes off the bat as he looks to go over long-on. Rabada dives to his right at long-on to catch this"
12.1,"Ashwin to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, pulled to long-on for one"
11.6,"Nortje to Pollard, no run","big yorker first up but Pollard's stride seems to have got him outside the line. At any rate, they don't have a review left. And replays show that Pollard has got his foot outside the line as he is hit on the toe. Fast yorker first up. Not a bad shout from the bowler"
11.5,"Nortje to Yadav, OUT","this lull in the last three overs has brought about the wicket. Good bowling too. Short bowling like they mean it. This one cramps him up, and also gets big on him, and all Surya manages is a top edge to long leg"
11.4,"Nortje to Yadav, no run","short ball, no room, and he is beaten on the ramp again. Twice in two overs now"
11.3,"Nortje to Yadav, FOUR runs","disdainfully ends the boundary drought, and brings up his fifty. Dominant except the last two overs. Takes this length ball from outside off, plays with a straight back and then flicks it at the last moment to beat midwicket"
11.2,"Nortje to Yadav, no run","slower ball, on off, pushed to cover: 15 balls without a boundary now"
11.1,"Nortje to Yadav, no run","short of a length, wide, punched nicely but straight to point"
10.6,"Rabada to Yadav, 1 run",looks to attack him but Rabada gets this bouncer high enough to not let him pull to midwicket. Surya ends up mis-hitting this to long-on for one
10.5,"Rabada to Yadav, no run",looks for the ramp to this short ball but is beaten by the loopy bounce. Twelve balls without a boundary
10.4,"Rabada to Ishan, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, down leg. clipped for one to square leg"
10.3,"Rabada to Ishan, no run","short of a length, no room, opens the face, can't beat point"
10.2,"Rabada to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length, quick, on top of off, steered down to third man for one"
10.1,"Rabada to Yadav, no run",misses out on a leg-stump half-volley. Ends up hitting this straight to midwicket in the circle

9.5,"Axar Patel to Ishan, no run","on a length, can't drive this, can't pull this. Pushes it back to Axar"
9.4,"Axar Patel to Ishan, 2 runs","short ball, stays low, but Kishan still pulls this straight enough of deep midwicket to be able to come back for two"

8.5,"Sams to Yadav, FOUR runs","slower short ball, and Surya has dragged this from wide outside off and rolls his wrists on the pull to clear square leg. What awareness of the field. Has picked his spot spotlessly"
8.4,"Sams to Yadav, no run","slower ball, on a length, pushed to cover. Plays in front of the body so he doesn't try an attacking shot"

7.5,"Ashwin to Yadav, 1 run","full, middle and off, driven to long-on for one"
7.4,"Ashwin to de Kock, OUT","Ashwin has another Mumbai wicket. He is single-handedly keeping them in the contest. de Kock looks to keep attacking to look to deny DC their plan for bowling high pace in the back 10. He charges out, Ashwin slows it down, he looks to go inside-out, but all he gets is a toe-end. Caught at long-off"
7.3,"Ashwin to Yadav, 1 run","quick length ball, driven down to long-on for one"
7.2,"Ashwin to Yadav, SIX runs","slog sweep, the big slog sweep. Uses his height to reach it even though the ball is not full enough. Keeps his head down, and lofts this over midwicket"

6.6,"Axar Patel to Yadav, 1 run","driven uppishly, straight of short cover, gets a single to long-off"
6.5,"Axar Patel to Yadav, FOUR runs","incredible shot. This is disrespectful batting. Axar Patel has bowled a decent length ball outside off, but he has gone back, bent his back leg, created his length and late-cut this for four"
6.4,"Axar Patel to de Kock, 1 run","goes wide on the crease bowls wide, de Kock catches up with it, cuts this to deep cover"

6.1,"Axar Patel to de Kock, no run","repeated appeals from Pant for catch at the wicket. Not given. DC review it. de Kock looks to reverse-sweep this, the ball doesn't turn as much as expected, and it goes close to the glove and settles in Pant's gloves. Flat line on Ultra Edge, though. DC have lost the review"
5.6,"Ashwin to Yadav, FOUR runs","what a sign-off to the field restrictions. This is some shot. Glory days of West Indies batsmen like. He has gone to a length-ball offbreak, leant back further, raises his front leg and managed to send this punch scurrying between cover and cover-point"
5.5,"Ashwin to Yadav, no run","flatter, short of that driving length. Defended back to him"
5.4,"Ashwin to Yadav, SIX runs","another pause in the stride, and it doesn't matter if he has bowled an offbreak or carrom ball because he has pitched too close to Surya, who has lofted him over mid-off casually for a six"

4.6,"Nortje to Yadav, no run","wide length ball, pushed to cover"
4.5,"Nortje to Yadav, no run","big appeal for the catch at the wicket as Surya is beaten on the pull. There is a noise for sure as it passes the bat, but the umpire doesn't give it. And they don't review it either. Replays show why. Not even close to the bat or the glove"
4.4,"Nortje to Yadav, FOUR runs","this time with a vertical bat. Quick length ball, good bounce, but Surya flicks this in the air and over midwicket. There is a man at deep square so he has to make sure he doesn't drag this too far. And he manages that"
4.3,"Nortje to Yadav, FOUR runs","phew  that is disrespectful. Short of a length, quick, but Surya just walks across and short-arm pulls this through midwicket. This is high-quality execution"
4.2,"Nortje to de Kock, 1 run","doesn't carry to third man. de Kock swings across the line of a quick ball just short of a length, and the edge nearly carries all the way but falls well short"

3.3,"Axar Patel to de Kock, SIX runs","long-on and midwicket back, but de Kock takes them both on. He is not going to let the left-arm spinner settle. Drives this on the up without reaching its pitch, and goes over wide long-on for a six"

2.6,"Rabada to de Kock, 2 leg byes","signs of dew as Nortje slips when fielding this at third man? de Kock looks for the big pull over midwicket this time, gets an inside edge onto the pad, and the deflection goes fine of third man.

2.5,"Rabada to de Kock, FOUR runs","slower short ball, 121ks, de Kock does well to delay his pull shot, rolls his wrists on it, and also ends up dragging this to the left of deep square leg"

1.3,"Ashwin to Rohit Sharma, OUT","big offbreak first ball, and he has been given. Think he needn't review if he hasn't hit this. Big offbreak not for the big sideways movement, but how much this has done in the air. Drifting and dipping, making him play down the wrong line, and then turning it in to hit him bang in front. No hesitation in raising the finger"
1.2,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","quicker length ball, bottom edge onto the toe. They steal a single"
1.1,"Ashwin to de Kock, no run","half-volley on the toes, clipped to midwicket. Crisp shot, with the deep man square. Six feet either side, and this was runs"

0.5,"Sams to de Kock, FOUR runs","looking for swing, he bowls yet another half-volley. He is looking to attack, and his mid-on is wide. So al de Kock needs to punish this error in length is to push-drive this fairly straight and the mid-on is beaten again"
0.4,"Sams to de Kock, FOUR runs","loses his line again. de Kock is loving these gifts. The length is fine, but he angles it down leg, and de Kock places it well forward of deep square leg"

11.1,"Chahar to Warner, SIX runs",goes to his fifty with a superb slog-sweep. Skimmer. Flat six. Wide long-on. Hits the triangles on the full. Taken off a length from outside off
10.6,"Krunal to Saha, FOUR runs","high full toss, and I think Chahar might have done them a favour by dropping this at deep square leg.

1.4,"Coulter-Nile to Saha, FOUR runs","another chip shot, and it is nearly a six over mid-on. Just a check-drive to a length ball. No follow-through in that drive. Just the bat speed and the timing"
1.3,"Coulter-Nile to Saha, SIX runs","lovely check-drive for a six. This is short of a length, wide, and he just nonchalantly chips this over mid-off. Just the bat speed and the timing carry it all the way for a six"

19.6,"Holder to Kulkarni, 2 runs",oh good to see. Sight for sore eyes. Batsmen not worrying about their not-outs and running the extra run off the last ball. And it doesn't matter than Warner's throw from long-on has hit Kularni in the helmet as he looks to complete the second. He hasn't changed direction so there is no appeal for obstruction

19.3,"Holder to Pollard, OUT","Holder with the three-fingered salute again. He has Pollard. This wicket is worth 10-15 runs. And he seems to have got really lucky. This is a plum full toss, and not even a slower one. Pollard is early into the shot, looks to drag this to leg, and is still early into it. Bowled"
19.2,"Holder to Pollard, SIX runs","yorker gone horribly wrong. Straight full toss, and Pollard flicks it over square leg for six. This is nonchalant six hitting"
19.1,"Holder to Pollard, no run","wide on the crease, low full toss, Pollard gets only the cue of the stick. Refuses the single"

18.5,"Natarajan to Pollard, SIX runs","thrice as nice. Blows to give KKR some oxygen. Wide low full toss, and this time Pollard goes straight down the ground and clears both the long-offs with ease. Breaks his bat in the process"
18.4,"Natarajan to Pollard, SIX runs","oh Pollard. That is why he is among the greatest T20 players ever. He has put the fear in the bowler's mind. Gets a low full toss this time, and gets inside the line to loft him over deep midwicket"
18.3,"Natarajan to Pollard, SIX runs","there are two long-offs in place and Pollard has hit this to the wider of the long-offs. Pandey gets under it, and Warner is next to him for the rebound. Pandey has to leap and take this overhead, but it slips through. Just a touch too high perhaps"
18.2,"Natarajan to Pollard, no run","Pollard walks practically halfway down the pitch, is hit in front of the wicket, but these are so hard to give. They review.

16.5,"Sandeep to Pollard, no run","Pollard walks practically halfway down the pitch, is hit in front of the wicket, but these are so hard to give. They review. I am sure the 3m thing will come into play here. And the Ultra-Edge shows a scratch anyway as the ball passes the bat. So the review is lost"
16.4,"Sandeep to Coulter-Nile, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, worked to leg for one"
16.3,"Sandeep to Ishan, OUT","a second played-on for Sandep. Slightly round-arm, own pace, wide full ball. Kishan reaches it, looks to go to cover, but gets a toe end onto the wicket"
16.2,"Sandeep to Ishan, SIX runs","shuffles wide on the crease, and unlike Pollard meeting yorkers early, he stays back in the crease to create a half-volley out of a full ball. And he has lofted him back over his head"
16.1,"Sandeep to Ishan, no run","slower ball wide yorker, Kishan early into it, and gets the toe-end"
15.6,"Natarajan to Pollard, FOUR runs","the Pollard power. A lot of batsmen struggle to get power into low full tosses. And I am not convinced this is a low full toss either. He has reached out in front of his body to convert a yorker into one. And the long-on and long-off are pretty straight, but he has still beaten them. The gold standard of death-overs batting"
15.5,"Natarajan to Pollard, FOUR runs","that is how difficult it is to bowl to Pollard. Misses the yorker by a little. Bowls a low full toss, or perhaps it is the Pollard reach that converts this into a low full toss. And he drives this hard and straight of long-off for four"
15.4,"Natarajan to Ishan, 1 run","full and wide, driven down to long-off for one"
15.3,"Natarajan to Ishan, no run",change-up ball. Goes from bowling the straight yorkers as he has been doing to Kishan to the wide length ball. Draws a dot as Kishan is already making room
15.2,"Natarajan to Pollard, 1 run","low full toss outside off, driven down to long-off for one"
15.1,"Natarajan to Ishan, 1 run","full and straight, whipped into the leg side for one"
14.6,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, no run","huge appeal for lbw, not given, and they have reviewed immediately. What good captaincy and bowling here. They have brought up the fielder to block that push, and they have successfully drawn a block from Pollard. And he has not picked the wrong'un, and this ball is hitting middle and leg. The umpire feels he has got outside the line with his height and big stride. The replay returns an umpire's call on that point of impact. He has survived by a bare margin. How crucial will it be in the coming five overs"
14.5,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 1 run","wrong'un, on the pads, worked to leg for one"
14.4,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, FOUR runs","another wrong'un, but bowls this too full, and he is not worried about playing the big shot again. Not the cleanest connection, but he has gone straight down the ground and beats long-on to his right"
14.3,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, 1 run",driven down the ground for one
14.2,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 1 run","Rashid has dropped a skier off his own bowling. He is filthy with himself. Kishan is winding up for the sweep, he bowls the wrong'un, does him in completely, draws the top edge, and Rashid runs towards midwicket to get under it. It slips out"
14.1,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, 1 run","on a length, middle and off, punched down to long-on for one"
13.6,"Nadeem to Pollard, 1 run","full, middle and leg, nudged into the leg side for one"
13.5,"Nadeem to Ishan, 1 run","looks like the wrist-spun delivery, but it is a full toss and has been driven to deep midwicket for one"
13.4,"Nadeem to Pollard, 1 run","Pollard with the big wind-up, Nadeem goes round-arm, and slows it down. He has to abort the shot, and settles for the single to cover-point"
13.3,"Nadeem to Pollard, no run","on a length, middle and leg, pushed to short midwicket"
13.2,"Nadeem to Pollard, no run","flighted outside off, pushed to extra cover"
13.1,"Nadeem to Pollard, no run","on a length, pushed back at him, and he has Kishan in his way as he dives to his right, but he does enough to deflect it to midwicket"
12.6,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, 1 run","wrong'un, back of a length, punched down to long-on for one"
12.5,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, no run","legbreak, just short of a length, middle and leg. Defended back"
12.4,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 1 run","legbreak, takes the thick inside edge for a single to leg"
12.3,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 2 runs","wrong'un, too short, pulled between the two deep fielders on the leg side"
12.2,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, 1 run","full, just outside off, driven hard to long-on for one"
12.1,"Rashid Khan to Tiwary, OUT","and Rashid Khan is right back into it. Wrong'un to take the edge, and for Saha to take it clean. It is an excellent catch because it has stayed low too. And Saha stays low for long enough. And Tiwary is defending for a legbreak here, and then when he sees it turn the other way, he sort of follows it with his hands"
11.6,"Nadeem to Tiwary, 1 run","has he bowled a legbreak here? This is loopy, slow, and turns the other way. Tiwary has enough time to adjust, and takes a single to cover"
11.5,"Nadeem to Tiwary, no run","turn from him, off a length, outside off. Defended to cover"
11.4,"Nadeem to Krunal, OUT","one more for Nadeem. This pitch is extremely slow. A length ball, Pandya looking to work it to leg, but the ball stops on him and takes the leading edge for a lob to settle with Williamson at short midwicket"
11.3,"Nadeem to Krunal, no run","fired in, on a length, into the pads, worked to midwicket"
11.2,"Nadeem to Krunal, no run","slow through the air, really full, driven straight to mid-off"
11.1,"Nadeem to Yadav, OUT","short of a length, wide, stays low, Surya punches, is beaten, and Saha breaks the wicket. Oh this ball is so slow that Surya has dragged his back foot trying to reach it. He has slipped out of the crease and hasn't gone back in by the time Saha stumps him"
10.6,"Natarajan to Ishan, no run","yorker, dug out into his own toe and then back to Natarajan"
10.5,"Natarajan to Yadav, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, punched down to long-on for one"
10.4,"Natarajan to Ishan, 1 run","full and straight, Kishan can't get under it, drives it along the ground to long-on for one"
10.3,"Natarajan to Yadav, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, he delays the shot and flicks it to deep square leg for one"
10.2,"Natarajan to Yadav, no run","on-pace, fuller, nearly a yorker, and slightly down leg. Surya early into the flick. Beaten and hit on the toe"
10.1,"Natarajan to Yadav, no run","slower ball, on a length, cutting away from around leg, pushed to cover"
9.6,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length, wrong'un, slow turn. He has time to adjust and punch this into the leg side"
9.5,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, no run","wrong'un, on a length, outside off, and he defends this back to Rashid"
9.4,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 1 leg bye","dug in short, and Kishan is early into the pull because it sits in the surface"
9.3,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, SIX runs","these Mumbai Indians youngsters have no respect for the legends of the game. A flighted wrong'un, and he clears the front leg to loft him right back over his head"
9.2,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, 1 run","full, on the pads, he looks to flick, but gets a leading edge towards point"
9.1,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, FOUR runs","Surya keeps sweeping Rashid. Takes this off a length, from outside off, and this time he beats deep square leg to his left"
8.6,"Nadeem to Yadav, 1 run","slightly round-arm with this ball, full, just outside off, driven down to long-off for one"
8.5,"Nadeem to Ishan, 1 run","drilled hard at him, Nadeem gets a hand at it, and I, for one, won't call it a drop but three runs saved. The ricochet nearly hits the wicket at the non-striker's end, and would have caught Surya short if it had"
8.4,"Nadeem to Yadav, 1 run","delays the delivery with a pause in his run-up. Not that that is the reason, but for a change the Surya inside-out chip goes to long-off instead of extra cover"
8.3,"Nadeem to Ishan, 1 run","full and straight, dug out to long-on for one"
8.2,"Nadeem to Yadav, 1 run","on a length, on off, punched down to long-off for one"
8.1,"Nadeem to Ishan, 1 run","shaping up for the big sweep, but Nadeem keeps the length away from him. He adjusts to drive it to long-off"
7.6,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 1 run","slower in the air, overpitched, driven down to long-on for one"
7.5,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, 1 run","another sweep from outside off, just the single, but he is not letting Rashid bowl the way he wants to"
7.4,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 1 run","wrong'un, pulled in the air, but the midwicket is back, so they get a single"
7.3,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, 1 run",sweep now. Gets a single to long leg
7.2,"Rashid Khan to Yadav, 2 runs","lovely shot. Inside-out chip to a Rashid Khan legbreak, well over extra cover. Gets a couple"
7.1,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, pulled down to long-on for one"
6.6,"Natarajan to Ishan, 1 run",worked to leg for a single
6.5,"Natarajan to Yadav, 1 run","dropped. Think he took one return catch last match. Sundar, I think. But here he has dropped one. Surya toe-ends this back at him, not too hard, but his hands don't go at same trajectory as the ball. Doesn't even get a touch on it"
6.4,"Natarajan to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length, straight, pulled to wide long-on for one"
6.3,"Natarajan to Ishan, no run","short of a length, quick, no room, punched with an open face to point"
6.2,"Natarajan to Ishan, no run","on a length, wicket to wicket, Kishan looks to work with the angle, but gets a soft leading edge back to the bowler"

5.3,"Nadeem to Yadav, no run","angling in, on a length, defended to leg"
5.2,"Nadeem to Yadav, FOUR runs","nobody can stop this one. Short of a length, straight, quick, and he makes room to punch this between cover-point and extra cover"
5.1,"Nadeem to Yadav, FOUR runs","through the leg of cover-point. Samad is the fielder. Actually not through the legs, but to his left. Surya has punched this square, and Samad has not made allowance for the spin away to his left"
4.6,"Sandeep to Ishan, no run","full, outside off, punched square on the off side, but straight to the fielder at point"
4.5,"Sandeep to Ishan, no run","on a length, angling in, defended back to him"
4.4,"Sandeep to de Kock, OUT","one shot too many, and Sandeep has nine Powerplay wickets now. Of all the balls he has chosen a wide full toss to get out to. To Sandeep's credit, this is a slower ball, which means de Kock is early into his drive, and he gets the inside edge onto the wicket"
4.3,"Sandeep to de Kock, SIX runs","de Kock toying around with Sandeep now. Now he walks down at a slower ball, delays his swing a touch and lofts him over wide long-on"
4.2,"Sandeep to de Kock, SIX runs","that is a de Kock special. Oh how quickly he picks the length. This is just a length ball. Maybe inches short of good length, but de Kocks picks it so early, goes back, and pulls it into the road"
4.1,"Sandeep to de Kock, FOUR runs","lovely shot. He leaves the crease, Sandeep bowls the slower ball, but he delays the shot to reach it on the half-volley and place the drive wide of mid-off for four"
3.6,"Holder to Yadav, no run","full and straight, driven hard, straight of mid-off, but Warner is quick and onto it in a flash"
3.5,"Holder to Yadav, 2 runs","slower offcutter, on a length, Yadav picks it halfway trhough his drive but goes ahead with the shot and chips it over extra cover"
3.4,"Holder to Yadav, no run","short, wide, and the lack of pace off the wicket means he is beaten on the cut"
3.3,"Holder to Yadav, no run","that fielder at deep square leg went more towards midwicket after the last shot, and this time he wants to go to the right of that man by shuffling across and playing a bit of a ramp. Beaten outside off and hit on the pad"
3.2,"Holder to Yadav, FOUR runs","on a length, straight, and Yadav gets inside the line and plays the pick-up over midwicket. Just the flick of the wrists"
3.1,"Holder to de Kock, 1 run","short, hip high, but he has a deep square leg in place to keep this pull down to just one run"
2.6,"Sandeep to Yadav, no run","short of a length, outside off, punched to mid-off"
2.5,"Sandeep to Yadav, no run","plays with softer hands this time, and keeps this down and to mid-off"
2.4,"Sandeep to Yadav, FOUR runs","risky shot. The slowness of the pitch. Surya just pushes at a wide length ball, and the ball stops on him, and he ends up hitting this in the air. Lucky that it has gone wide of short cover"
2.3,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, OUT","the slow pitch does its job, and I also think he has bowled the knuckle ball here. Rohit gives him the charge, Sandeep slows it down, and he ends up chipping it to mid-off. Just doesn't get enough timing to clear that man"
2.2,"Sandeep to de Kock, 1 run","slightly short of a length, punched to deep square leg for one"
2.1,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","on a length, wicket to wicket, driven down to long-on for one"
1.6,"Holder to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","the slow pitch is showing its wares. Rohit looks to drive him over extra cover, but he ends up lofting this towards Samad at deep cover. It falls just short. Holder feels he could have gone for the catch"
1.5,"Holder to de Kock, 1 run","short of a length, wide, cut away to deep point for one"
1.4,"Holder to de Kock, 2 runs","full, swinging in, clipped off the toes, forward of deep square leg. Samad runs to his right and puts in a dive to save two runs"
1.3,"Holder to de Kock, no run","looks to shuffle across and flick him behind square on the leg side, and he edges a length ball into his pad"
1.2,"Holder to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","wide on the crease, angling in, tucked away off the hip"
1.1,"Holder to Rohit Sharma, no run","on a length, outside off, punched to extra cover"
0.6,"Sandeep to de Kock, no run","length ball, stops on him, driven uppishly to mid-off"

0.4,"Sandeep to de Kock, no run","full, swinging away, pushed to cover"
0.3,"Sandeep to de Kock, no run","swinging away from de Kock, ending up on top of off. He gets a bottom edge that bounces over the wicket"
0.2,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","driven back on the up, Sandeep gets a hand to it, and Rohit takes a quick single. A quick single. An early test of his hamstring"
0.1,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","starts with an inswinger, Sharma has to reach out to push at it. Hits the inside half of the bat and goes to mid-on"
18.6,"Siraj to Pant, FOUR runs","top edge clears the keeper and Delhi Capitals will get two shots at the final. Short ball across the corridor, looks for the pull again but that is too high for him"
18.5,"Siraj to Pant, no run",short and across the corridor. Inside edge onto his body saves him from being bowled. Trickles out to the keeper
18.4,"Siraj to Stoinis, 1 run","full and just outside off, mistimed slog down to long-on along the floor"
18.3,"Siraj to Stoinis, 2 runs",short of a length and wide outside off. Hammered on the up to sweeper's right
18.3,"Siraj to Stoinis, 1 wide","short and down leg side, beaten on the whip"
18.2,"Siraj to Stoinis, SIX runs",just over Chahal at deep square! Kohli brings out the teapot. He reckons that should have been taken. Short and up at the chest. Top edge on the pull and it hangs despairingly in the air as Chahal takes a few steps back. Flicks his index finger and is over the line
18.1,"Siraj to Pant, 1 run","short and at leg stump, has a massive heave and miscues the pull to deep backward square"
18.1,"Siraj to Pant, 1 wide","good length and wide outside off, left alone"
17.6,"Sundar to Stoinis, no run","good length and just outside off, punched to extra cover off the back foot"
17.5,"Sundar to Pant, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to long-off"
17.4,"Sundar to Pant, no run",short of a length and gets stuck between Pant's legs as he misses on the pull. LBW appeal is turned down. He's around the wicket and that's probably going down
17.3,"Sundar to Stoinis, 1 run","good length on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
17.2,"Sundar to Rahane, OUT","steered straight to short third. Short of a length and across middle stump. Tries to use the angle to play the reverse lap. It comes off the top edge and is an easy take. Rahane's put them on the brink, can't take them over"
17.1,"Sundar to Rahane, 2 runs","good length on leg stump, steps out and drags that to deep midwicket's left"
16.6,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Rahane, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven down to long-on with the angle"
16.5,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Pant, 1 run",good length and pushed across off stump. Steps out and slices to sweeper

16.3,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Pant, 1 run","full and into leg stump, jabbed to midwicket's left"
16.2,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Iyer, OUT",drags it straight to long-on. Good length and holding in the pitch outside off. Reaches out and looks to clear the straight boundary. It comes off the inside half
16.2,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Iyer, 1 wide","good length and pushed wide outside off, left alone"
16.1,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Rahane, 1 run","good length and wide outside off, under-edge on the drive to extra cover's left"
15.6,"Chahal to Rahane, 1 run","googly, full and at off stump. Leans in and drives to deep extra cover"

15.1,"Chahal to Rahane, 1 run","good length on off stump, reverse sweep straight to backward point"
14.6,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Rahane, 1 run","good length on leg stump, clipped towards long-on and that is fifty for Rahane. A welcome one for him in what has been a wretched season so far. But this is the kind of chase Rahane is made for, and he's done the job so far"
14.5,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Rahane, 2 runs","full on leg stump, flicked through vacant square leg"
14.4,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Rahane, no run",good length and slowed down outside off. Under-edge on the attempted drive

13.4,"Chahal to Iyer, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven to long-on"
13.3,"Chahal to Iyer, no run",full and making him reach out for the cover drive. On the bounce to a leaping Kohli's right at extra cover
13.2,"Chahal to Rahane, 1 run",good length and sliding on at leg stump. Nudged to short fine off the inside edge
13.1,"Chahal to Rahane, 2 runs",short of a length and turning away outside off. Gets deep in the crease and whips to long-on's right
12.6,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Rahane, 1 leg bye",good length and sliding into the pads as he looks to flick. Single stolen from short fine
12.5,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Iyer, 1 run",short of a length and into leg stump. Back foot punch comes off the thick inside edge to deep square's right
12.4,"Shahbaz Ahmed to S Dhawan, OUT",lapped straight to short fine! Dhawan knows what he wants to do but he's down for it too early. Shahbaz slows it down. A full one on leg stump. He lifts it straight to the fielder. Standing ovation from the dugout as he goes out
12.3,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Rahane, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
12.2,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Rahane, SIX runs","lofts it over long-off! Short of a length outside off. Steps out and isn't anywhere near the pitch of this. But he goes all in, extends the arms, lifts his back leg as he does it, and lobs it gently over the fielder"
12.1,"Shahbaz Ahmed to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length on middle stump, swept to deep square's right"
11.6,"Udana to Rahane, FOUR runs","slapped over extra cover. Slower ball, short and wide outside off. Waits on it as he presses onto the front foot and times sweetly to clear the fielder. One bounce, close the boundary, and over"

11.4,"Udana to S Dhawan, 2 runs",short and outside off. Waits on it and cuts to point's right. Point reaches out and gets a right hand on it

7.2,"Sundar to S Dhawan, no run","lbw appeal turned down. Sundar shakes his head as they discuss the review. Going down, perhaps. Short of a length and skidding onto his back leg as he looks for the whip through the leg side. Sundar is around the wicket, remember"

4.6,"Sundar to S Dhawan, 1 run","big lbw appeal as he's beaten on the inside edge. They don't review it. Ah, in fact there is an inside edge on this. Length ball sliding in from outside off, was playing for the one that straightens, bat in front of off stump"
4.5,"Sundar to Rahane, 1 run","good length at middle stump, punched to mid-on off the front foot"
4.4,"Sundar to S Dhawan, 1 run","good length and into middle stump, punched to midwicket's left off the back foot"
4.3,"Sundar to Rahane, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to extra cover's left off the front foot"
4.2,"Sundar to Rahane, FOUR runs","good length at middle stump, gets the front foot out and across and sweeps with the turn. To square leg's right"
4.1,"Sundar to Rahane, no run","good length and into middle stump, clipped to midwicket off the back foot"
3.6,"Siraj to Rahane, 1 leg bye",short of a length and thuds into the thigh guard as he gets deep for the leg glance
3.5,"Siraj to Rahane, no run",good length and into off stump. Defended to point off the front foot
3.4,"Siraj to Rahane, no run","good length and at off stump, defended into the covers off the back foot"
3.3,"Siraj to S Dhawan, 1 run",good length and across middle stump. Dropped into the covers with soft hands
3.2,"Siraj to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length on off stump, whipped to midwicket"
3.1,"Siraj to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","drilled past mid-off. Overpitched and just outside off. Slides nicely onto the bat as Dhawan drives from an upright position, full face offered. Slightly aerial to his partner's right but very safe"
2.6,"Morris to Rahane, 2 runs",good length and into leg stump. Leans in and swishes at that. Pings off the inside half to midwicket's right
2.5,"Morris to S Dhawan, 1 run",short and into off stump from around the wicket. Chopped down to deep backward square
2.4,"Morris to Rahane, 1 leg bye",good length and into leg stump. Deflected to fine leg's right as he looks to flick
2.3,"Morris to S Dhawan, 1 run","short and wide outside off, a controlled cut out to deep backward point"
2.2,"Morris to S Dhawan, no run","full slower ball just outside off, eyes light up for the big drive, but it's off the toe-end and into the covers"
2.1,"Morris to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",short and across off stump. He gets the back leg into the off side and gets the cut off the thick outside edge and fine of short third man
1.6,"Siraj to Rahane, no run","good length and wide outside off, left alone"
1.5,"Siraj to Shaw, OUT","oh that is a stunner from Siraj! Unplayable. Simply stunning. He said pre-match about how he's been chewing Dale Steyn's ear off in training. Well this is one way to pay tribute to Steyn. It's a very similar initial line - at middle stump - as the last few balls. But the seam is upright and this shapes towards off stump, very late in it's path. Lands on the seam and keeps going away and climbs past Shaw's angled bat to hit the top of off. Actually scratch that, the bat is straight enough, he was looking to defend it. Dream delivery"
1.4,"Siraj to Shaw, no run",short of a length and into middle and leg. Pushed to midwicket's left off the back foot
1.3,"Siraj to Shaw, FOUR runs",oh easy. Full and into the pads. Gets forward and leans into that to whip this wide of mid-on
1.2,"Siraj to Shaw, no run","short and wide outside off, chopped to cover point"
1.1,"Siraj to Shaw, FOUR runs",good length and onto the hips. Stays tall and allows this on before whipping it to the square leg boundary
0.6,"Morris to S Dhawan, no run",short and up at the left shoulder. Looks for the hook but is through it early and cops that on the left forearm. It lands pitch side
0.5,"Morris to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length outside off, left alone"
0.4,"Morris to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",oh handsome. This is overpitched outside off and he leans into the drive after a half stride out. Holds the shape as he gets it to mid-off's right
0.3,"Morris to S Dhawan, 2 runs",full and wide outside off. Reaches out to try and drill that through the covers. Thick inside edge past the keeper and slip gives chase
0.2,"Morris to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",low full toss swung into the corridor outside off. Half a stride out and punched firmly to deep point's left
0.1,"Morris to Shaw, 1 run",good length and shaped away outside off. Hangs inside the line of that and steers to third man
19.6,"Nortje to Shahbaz Ahmed, 1 run","short and wide outside off. Backs deep into the crease for the upper cut, but that comes off the toe-end and ends up at extra cover"
19.5,"Nortje to Sundar, 1 bye",short and rising quickly in the corridor outside off. He's well beaten on the cut but they sneak a bye
19.4,"Nortje to Udana, OUT","taken at long-off. 150.4kph. Short and rising outside off. Backs into the leg side and looks for the horizontal bat shot. Slices it up for Iyer, who had gone back after the last ball. Runs in and takes it easily"
19.3,"Nortje to Udana, FOUR runs",just clears mid-off with a miscued swipe. Short of a length and just outisde off. Slices from under that. Looks like ball hitting bat rather than the other way round. But it's looped over Iyer and run into the boundary
19.2,"Nortje to AB, 1 run, OUT","full toss at middle stump, goes too hard at the slog and miscues it. Ends up at long-on where Rahane has done brilliantly. Not the fielding itself, because it was straight at him. But the presence of mind to throw to the end AB is running at - the striker's end to keep strike. Took his time, lobbed it in really. Pant grabs it on the half-volley and catches AB well short. That is potentially a few runs saved for DC"
19.1,"Nortje to AB, no run","beats him with a slower ball. A full toss outside off, but dipping rapidly as AB looks for the slog"
18.6,"Rabada to Dubey, OUT","finds deep midwicket. Short and just outside off. There in his pulling arc, but he's got no elevation on it.Dips into Rahane's lap"
18.5,"Rabada to Dubey, no run",short of a length and into the body. Pings off the thigh guard and to the keeper
18.4,"Rabada to Dubey, FOUR runs",lifted over extra cover. Short of a length and across him. Stays leg side of that and gets his hands through that with an angled bat
18.3,"Rabada to Dubey, no run","beaten on the pull. Short of a length and across the corridor, it's past his inside edge"
18.2,"Rabada to AB, 1 run","short and just outside off, dragged to deep midwicket with a toe-ended pull"
18.1,"Rabada to AB, SIX runs",sent a million miles over the leg side! Whew. A knee high full toss on leg stump. Need one say more when AB is the batsman? Firm in his half-crouch and sends it over square leg
17.6,"Sams to Dubey, FOUR runs",swiped to deep midwicket's left. Sams finishes poorly. A slower short ball spinning into Dube at hip height. Another easy swing across the line for him
17.5,"Sams to Dubey, 2 runs",full and slow outside off. Backs away and drills to long-off's right
17.4,"Sams to Dubey, SIX runs",slogged to deep midwicket's left. Sams misses on the yorker. It's a friendly full toss at middle stump and it feeds Dube's swing across the line
17.3,"Sams to Dubey, no run","slower ball, short of a length and at 108kph. Turning into the corridor and past the inside edge as Dube looks to slog this"
17.2,"Sams to AB, 1 run","low yorker outside off, big heave ends up at deep midwicket off the thick inside edge"
17.1,"Sams to AB, FOUR runs",crunched to long-off's left. Full slower ball outside off. Half a stride out and then he leans back to drive aerially and open up the region for him. Over the line on the bounce
16.6,"Rabada to AB, 1 run","yorker at middle stump, 143.6kph. Driven off the toe-end to midwicket's left"
16.5,"Rabada to AB, 2 runs","short of a length at off stump, turned to deep square's right off the back foot"
16.4,"Rabada to Dubey, 1 run","slower short ball at off stump, waits on that and jabs it to point's right"
16.3,"Rabada to Dubey, no run","low full toss on leg stump, dragged into the leg side off the toe-end"
16.2,"Rabada to Dubey, no run","good length and pushed across off stump, looks to push through the covers with minimal feet. That's flown past him. 136kph"
16.1,"Rabada to AB, 1 run",good length and into leg stump. Pushed aerially towards long-on
15.6,"Nortje to Morris, OUT",outside edge is taken and the Morris gamble doesn't pay off. It looks like a cutter from Nortje on first viewing. On slow-mo that doesn't seem to be the case though. But that short ball has really gripped and lifted slowly off the surface as Morris runs down at it. Gets bigger and bigger on him and it's a thick edge that Pant takes above his head
15.5,"Nortje to Morris, no run","good length at middle stump, driven on the rise to extra cover"
15.4,"Nortje to Padikkal, OUT","knocks middle stump with a 152kph length ball. It's scrambled seam, it's angled across from an initial leg-stump line. Padikkal backs into the leg side to try and lift him over the covers like he had in the powerplay. It's rapidly past him to hit the top of the stumps"
15.3,"Nortje to AB, 1 run",length and outside off. Miscued slog ends up at long-on
15.2,"Nortje to AB, SIX runs",into the boundary padding at long-off. they're checking it it's on the pull. Short of a length ball outside off. Sliced over mid-off again and it's deemed to have hit the padding on the full
15.1,"Nortje to AB, 2 runs","just evades Iyer running back from mid-off. Good length and just outside off, looks to loft it over him. He can't get a hand on it after running back, looking over his shoulder. It bounces into his body as he tumbles"
14.6,"Sams to Padikkal, 2 runs",safely clears point. Full and wide outside off. Throws his hands at that and it comes off the cue-end. Sweeper cleans up to the right as Padikkal brings up his fifth fifty of the season and his third on this ground
14.5,"Sams to Padikkal, FOUR runs","swatted to the backward square boundary. Fine leg and square leg were in the circle, and this short cutter turns nicely into middle and leg. Padikkal reaches out and puts that away"
14.5,"Sams to Padikkal, 1 wide",beaten on the wide yorker outside off. just past the tramline again
14.5,"Sams to Padikkal, 1 wide","yorker just past the tramline outside off, left alone"
14.4,"Sams to AB, 1 run",short of a length and into middle stump. Steps out and is cramped on the cut. Chopped to extra cover's left
14.3,"Sams to AB, 2 runs","cutter slides on, short of a good length and into off stump. Miscued pull to deep square's right"
14.2,"Sams to Padikkal, 1 run",106kph. Cutter at a length outside off. It's like Axar's back. Padikkal into that early and awkwardly jabs that through square leg
14.1,"Sams to AB, 1 run","good length and into middle stump. Looks to force through the off side, thick inside edge into the leg side"
13.6,"Axar Patel to AB, 1 run","good length and wide outside off, reaches out and laces that along the ground to sweeper"
13.5,"Axar Patel to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length outside off, laboured cut to short third man's left"
13.4,"Axar Patel to Padikkal, 2 runs",full and pushed through at a middle stump line. Looks for the slog and gets an inside edge into vacant square leg. Short fine is slow in getting across to that and Axar has given him an earful
13.3,"Axar Patel to AB, 1 run","good length at off stump, gets low and sweeps to deep square"
13.2,"Axar Patel to AB, 2 runs","good length and just outside off, tapped off the front foot to sweeper's left"
13.1,"Axar Patel to AB, no run",appeal for lbw is turned down. Was looking for the sweep and this length ball hit him well outside off
12.6,"Ashwin to Padikkal, no run",grip and turn. Lobbed up at 78.3kph on a middle stump line. Leans in and pushes with hard hands to extra cover
12.5,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run",good length and turning into off stump. Waits and waits before patting that down to long-on
12.4,"Ashwin to AB, no run","tossed up at off stump, driven back to the bowler"
12.3,"Ashwin to Kohli, OUT","taken at deep midwicket! Nice and slow again from Ashwin, 77kph. Up at length on middle stump. Kohli steps out to make the pitch of that but there's just no pace on this. Slugs it into the long boundary. Stoinis is in from the line, but he hangs on above his head and then does well to balance himself on the steps back"
12.2,"Ashwin to Padikkal, 1 run","round-arm again, good length and angled into off stump. Driven to long-off. He really slowed that down"
12.1,"Ashwin to Padikkal, no run","short of a length and sliding into the corridor. Under-edge on the cut, into his leg"
11.6,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 2 runs","good length at leg stump, flicked to deep square's right with the angle"
11.5,"Axar Patel to Kohli, SIX runs",lifted over long-on! This is what he was looking to do on that dropped catch delivery - use Axar's angle against him. It's good length and it's in at middle stump. This time he's created swinging room after stepping out and lofted it from under
11.4,"Axar Patel to Padikkal, 1 run","good length and wide outside off, drags it with a sweep in the non-striker's direction. Axar stretches and gets a hand to it"
11.3,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","good length at off stump, punched to long-off on the back foot"
11.2,"Axar Patel to Padikkal, 3 runs",leading edge as he looks for the ramp. Length ball at leg and it ends up fine of short third man. A very tentative chase from Ashwin that the bowler isn't too thrilled about. Kohli is back for the third
11.1,"Axar Patel to Padikkal, no run","short of a length in the corridor, chopped to short third man"
10.6,"Rabada to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length at leg stump, front leg off the ground as he whips this on the bounce to deep square"
10.5,"Rabada to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, whipped to deep square's left"
10.4,"Rabada to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length outside off, pulled on the bounce to deep square"
10.3,"Rabada to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, steered to third man off the back foot"
10.2,"Rabada to Kohli, FOUR runs","crunched over extra cover. A full slower ball outside off, waits on that and gets a stride out before lifting this over the fielder"
10.1,"Rabada to Kohli, no run",beaten. Short of a length and climbing in the corridor. Steps out and looks to slash through cover. It climbs past the bat
9.6,"Axar Patel to Padikkal, no run",length and tossed up slow outside off. Steps out and is forced to check himself and push this to extra cover
9.5,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","dropped at long-on! Nortje loses his footing, his shape, and then the ball. Kohli steps out for the release shot. It's a length ball at leg stump. No room for the loft and it comes off the inside half. Dips as Nortje runs in. He's taken the catch but slips and ends up on his back. The ball pops out as that happens"
9.4,"Axar Patel to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length at off stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
9.3,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","good length outside off, driven to long-off"
9.2,"Axar Patel to Kohli, no run",full outside off. Steps out and is beaten in flight. Looks to whip through the line and gets an inside edge to midwicket
9.1,"Axar Patel to Padikkal, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
8.6,"Ashwin to Padikkal, 1 run","round-arm length ball, in at middle stump. Punched to long-on's right off the back foot"
8.5,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length and into leg stump, clipped to deep backward square's right"
8.4,"Ashwin to Kohli, no run","short of a length at leg stump, flicked straight to midwicket"
8.3,"Ashwin to Padikkal, 1 run",good length and slow at middle stump. Gets deep in the crease and clips off the back foot to deep square's right
8.2,"Ashwin to Padikkal, no run",short of a length and sliding in at off stump. Chopped hurriedly to short third man
8.1,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run","good length at middle stump, gets a big stride out and flicks to deep square"
7.6,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, punched to long-on off the back foot"
7.5,"Axar Patel to Padikkal, 1 run",short of a length and sliding on in the corridor. Punched to long-on off the back foot
7.4,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
7.3,"Axar Patel to Padikkal, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
7.2,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","length and into the stumps, steps out and punches to long-off"
7.1,"Axar Patel to Padikkal, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, whipped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
6.6,"Ashwin to Kohli, no run","good length outside off, looks to drive through the off side but that's gripped and come off the inside edge. To midwicket's right"
6.5,"Ashwin to Padikkal, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, flicked to deep square's right"
6.4,"Ashwin to Padikkal, no run",short of Ashwin. Length ball drifts in at a middle stump. Drives with hard hands and it comes off the inside half and lands in front of the bowler
6.3,"Ashwin to Padikkal, no run",short of a length and delivered with a lower arm. Slides into off stump and he punches to extra cover
6.2,"Ashwin to Padikkal, FOUR runs","short and just outside off, gets deep in the crease and chops it between backward point and short third"
6.1,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run","good length and just outside off, driven along the ground to long-off"
5.6,"Nortje to Padikkal, no run",a 144kph bouncer follows. At his head. Padikkal stands tall and sways his head away at the last moment
5.5,"Nortje to Padikkal, FOUR runs","short of a length across him, waits on that and opens the face late to steer this to short third man's left. The shortest part of the ground tonight and sweeper point has no chance"
5.4,"Nortje to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length outside off, allows that on and runs it to third man"
5.3,"Nortje to Kohli, FOUR runs",punched past extra cover off the back foot. Short of a length and just outside off. Stands tall and threads the gap in the infield
5.2,"Nortje to Kohli, no run","good length and just outside off, punched on the up to extra cover"
5.1,"Nortje to Kohli, no run",good length and just outside off at 143kph. Punched on the up to mid-off
4.6,"Rabada to Kohli, 1 run",full and at the stumps at 144.5kph. Flicked off the thick inside edge through square leg
4.5,"Rabada to Padikkal, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length at leg stump. Whipped on the bounce to deep square"
4.4,"Rabada to Padikkal, no run","beaten. Short of a good length and slanted across the corridor, fends inside the line of that"
4.3,"Rabada to Padikkal, FOUR runs","chipped over point. This is reminiscent of Mayank Agarwal yesterday, who gauged early that hitting boundaries along the ground was difficult on a slow surface. Padikkal with no intent to keep this drive down against a length ball across him"
4.2,"Rabada to Padikkal, no run","good length at off stump, defended down the pitch. Was early into it and took his bottom hand off as he did that"
4.1,"Rabada to Philippe, OUT",Shaw tracks back at cover and takes a simple catch. Philippe's driven and pulled without finding his timing tonight. This time he looks to go inside-out and chip over the off side. It's a length ball angled in at middle stump and he backs away before opening the face. Done it too early and it comes off the toe-end and is a friendly skier
3.6,"Nortje to Philippe, 1 run","short of a length outside off, miscued punch to extra cover's left as he clears his leg to make room. Padikkal sneaks in at the other end as Stoinis' throw misses"
3.5,"Nortje to Philippe, no run",short of a length and angled into the corridor. Looks for the pull but that ends up feebly to mid-on's left
3.4,"Nortje to Padikkal, 3 runs","lofted over mid-off but not quite with the same timing this time. More signs that it's sticky. Good length outside off, this time it comes off the high-ish part of the bat as he gets on the front foot and lofts deliberately. Rabada gives chase and swins towards the boundary to pull this back in. they're checking if his right elbow has made contact with the padding before the ball's out of his palm. It's very close, a matter of frames. It goes in Rabada's favour"
3.3,"Nortje to Padikkal, no run",beats the outside edge. Short of a length and jagged across the corridor as he's pinned on the back foot
3.2,"Nortje to Padikkal, FOUR runs","lovely lofted drive over cover. Nortje's extra pace is nice for this drive through the line from Padikkal that was Kohli mouthing ""wow"" and standing up in the dugout. It's a length ball pushed across him and he gets half a stride out and keeps his head very still to maintain balance under this. Nice wrists at the end help him get that over. Languid and elegant"
3.1,"Nortje to Philippe, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, looks to loft that over midwicket. Can only get it as far as mid-on"
2.6,"Sams to Padikkal, no run","good length and just outside off, defended to short third man"
2.5,"Sams to Philippe, 1 run",full and at off stump. Clears the front leg for the drive. Gets it off the inside edge to mid-on's left
2.4,"Sams to Philippe, no run","good length and just outside off, goes hard on the drive on the up, can't beat cover"
2.3,"Sams to Philippe, no run","slower ball, short of a length and just outside off. Punched to mid-off"
2.2,"Sams to Philippe, FOUR runs",slapped wide of mid-on. Short and sitting up nicely outside off. Looks like it stuck in the pitch. Philippe with a lovely swing on the front-foot pull
2.1,"Sams to Philippe, no run","good length and just outside off, stays leg side of that and pokes to extra cover"
2.1,"Sams to Philippe, 1 wide",full and wide outside off. Beaten on the drive
1.6,"Ashwin to Padikkal, 2 runs","good length and into leg stump, punched to deep midwicket's right off the back foot"
1.5,"Ashwin to Philippe, 1 run","good length and sliding on outside off, backs away and punches firmly at extra cover who misfields"
1.4,"Ashwin to Padikkal, 1 run",good length and lobbed outside off. Dropped into the covers with soft hands
1.3,"Ashwin to Philippe, 1 run",short of a length and just outside off. Punched to cover's left off the back foot and a lunging stop from Iyer
1.2,"Ashwin to Philippe, no run","full and just outside off, looks like a carrom ball too. Driven off the toe-end to extra cover"
1.1,"Ashwin to Padikkal, 1 run",short of a length and sliding into the hips. Glanced to short fine's right
0.6,"Sams to Philippe, no run","good length and just outside off, pushed into the off side"
0.5,"Sams to Philippe, no run",pull ends up hitting the stumps at the other end. Short of a length ball across him. He wants to pull but can't close the face on that as it goes away
0.4,"Sams to Philippe, 2 runs",sliding stop to the right from Nortje at long leg. Short ball was hooked firmly into the turf
0.3,"Sams to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length on middle stump, clipped to deep square off the back foot"
0.2,"Sams to Philippe, 1 run",good length and shaped into the corridor again. Punched to mid-off's right off the inside part of the bat
0.1,"Sams to Philippe, no run",short of a length and swung into the corridor. Shuffles and pushes this into the covers
19.6,"Nagarkoti, to Aaron, no run",eight-ball zero not out for Aaron as Nagarkoti bowls the short ball at him again and beats him
19.5,"Nagarkoti, to Aaron, no run","bouncer, accurate, and it beats Aaron's attempt to pull"
19.4,"Nagarkoti, to Aaron, no run",makes room to punch this on the up but can't beat short cover
19.3,"Nagarkoti, to Aaron, no run","quick short ball, at his helmet, Aaron has to throw his bat up in self defence. Another dot"
19.2,"Nagarkoti, to Aaron, no run","follows him with a length ball, gives him no room. Another dot for Aaron"
19.1,"Nagarkoti, to Gopal, 1 run","short of a length, no room, punched to deep point for one"
19.1,"Nagarkoti, to Gopal, 1 wide",wide down the leg side as he slips it down with the yorker
18.6,"Shivam Mavi to Aaron, no run","yorker, dug out to end the over"
18.5,"Shivam Mavi to Aaron, no run","short of a length, no room, pushed to point. Another dot"
18.4,"Shivam Mavi to Aaron, no run","hits the pad with a quick length ball, but it is a tough too high"
18.3,"Shivam Mavi to Kartik Tyagi, OUT","takes this on the rebound. This is a big wicket for KKR's overall chances. Tyagi has chipped a full ball back at him, he sticks out his right hand, onto the shoulder, and then into the chest and then his hands"
18.2,"Shivam Mavi to Gopal, 1 run","yorker, dug out to long-on for another single"
18.1,"Shivam Mavi to Kartik Tyagi, 1 run","yorker, middle and leg, dug out for one"
17.6,"Nagarkoti, to Gopal, no run","bouncer, at his head, and Gopal swings and misses"
17.5,"Nagarkoti, to Kartik Tyagi, 1 run","on a length, on off, runs off the outer half of the bat for one"
17.4,"Nagarkoti, to Gopal, 1 run","full toss, driven down to long-on for one"
17.3,"Nagarkoti, to Archer, OUT","Archer looks for another golf-swing six, and ends up toe-ending it. In the slot all right, but Archer is slightly early into it. Caught at long-on"
17.2,"Nagarkoti, to Gopal, 1 run",driven hard on the up but straight to deep cover
17.1,"Nagarkoti, to Archer, 1 run","full and straight, hit back at him. He gets a hand on it in follow-through. Just the single"
16.6,"Narine to Gopal, FOUR runs","another reverse sweep, and he has nailed it this time. DC and RCB will love this. KKR will absolutely hate it"
16.5,"Narine to Gopal, 2 runs","another reverse sweep, and this time he gets a top edge back over Karthik's head"
16.4,"Narine to Gopal, FOUR runs","reverse sweep, too late for RR, but it will hurt KKR. He has cleared the man at point"
16.3,"Narine to Archer, 1 run","hit hard, in the air, towards long-off, but it falls short of the man"
16.2,"Narine to Archer, no run","is he bowled or has this come off Karthik's body? He slogs across a straight ball, and the extra bounce beats him, and also the top of the wicket. It comes off Karthik's body to break the wicket, but Archer has never left the crease"

15.2,"Shivam Mavi to Gopal, no run","short, quick, beats Gopal's attempt to cut"
15.1,"Shivam Mavi to Archer, 1 run",another leading edge falls safe. Looks to work this to leg but ends up chipping it out of Mavi's reach
14.6,"Varun to Archer, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, pushed into the covers for one"
14.5,"Varun to Gopal, 1 run","nearly another for Varun. Leading edge as he closes the face on this legcutter, and it lobs to the left of him. Varun is reluctant to put in the dive. A dive would have got him the catch"
14.4,"Varun to Tewatia, OUT","Varun keeps on delivering. Tewatia has to go for it as the asking rate keeps climbing. He looks for the big sweep, but has been done in by the wrong'un. The top edge settles with Karthik"
14.3,"Varun to Gopal, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched down to long-off for one"
14.2,"Varun to Tewatia, 1 run","quick length ball, driven to long-on for one"
14.1,"Varun to Tewatia, 2 runs","gets inside the line to sweep, gets a toe-end of the bat to end up hitting this towards deep midwicket. The damp ball means Nagarkoti fumbles, and they take the second"
13.6,"Cummins to Gopal, no run","another, higher, bouncer. Gopal looks to ramp it, and is beaten"
13.5,"Cummins to Gopal, 2 runs",he has drawn the top edge on the pull but Gopal has managed to go in front of square while the catching man is at square leg. They get a couple
13.4,"Cummins to Tewatia, 1 run","low full toss, dug out for a single to long-on"
13.3,"Cummins to Tewatia, no run","looks to ramp, Cummins shortens the length, and he is beaten"
13.2,"Cummins to Tewatia, 2 runs","backs away, Cummins follows him, he places this wide of long-on and comes back for two"
13.1,"Cummins to Tewatia, no run","full, on off, driven hard but straight to mid-off"
12.6,"Varun to Gopal, no run","he might have made it back. Yorker, dug out to point, runs off when there is no single. Tewatia sends him back. He has to put a dive in to beat the throw"
12.5,"Varun to Gopal, no run","legcutter, on a length, outside off, pushed to cover"
12.4,"Varun to Gopal, no run","short of a length, good bounce, runs this down to short third man"
12.3,"Varun to Tewatia, 1 run","short of a length, down the leg side, and he has pulled this straight to long leg, He is disappointed with himself"

12.1,"Varun to Tewatia, 1 run","quick length ball, pushed down to long-off for one"
11.6,"Narine to Tewatia, 1 run","on a length, punched down to long-on for one"
11.5,"Narine to Tewatia, SIX runs",big sweep. Outta here. Tewatia down on a knee to dismiss this full offbreak out of his sight. Oh this has gone way back
11.4,"Narine to Tewatia, no run","fuller, higher, on off. Defended back to him"
11.3,"Narine to Tewatia, FOUR runs","top shot. Narine pitches short of a length, and he goes back to cut it in front of deep point for four. Tewatia's last dance this year"
11.2,"Narine to Gopal, 1 run",uppishly pushed down to long-on for one
11.1,"Narine to Gopal, no run","down the wicket, Narine stays short of a length and straight. Defended"
10.6,"Varun to Gopal, 1 run","another wrong'un, worked into the leg side for one"
10.5,"Varun to Gopal, no run",appeal for lbw as he bowls a slow wrong'un. Beats his inside edge but it is slipping down leg
10.4,"Varun to Buttler, OUT","huge wicket. Buttler is gone. And now KKR can look for the big margin. Legcutter, bowled fast, Buttler gets the length to pull but this one skids on hurries him into the shot. He has found deep midwicket to perfection"
10.3,"Varun to Buttler, 2 runs","tossed up outside off, driven forward of deep cover for two more"
10.2,"Varun to Buttler, no run","slower in the air, outside off, pushed to cover"
10.1,"Varun to Buttler, FOUR runs","unlucky. Quick legcutter, Buttler looks for the drive, and the skiddy ball takes the edge through for four"
9.6,"Nagarkoti, to Buttler, 1 run","fuller, into the pads, clipped away for one"
9.5,"Nagarkoti, to Buttler, 2 runs","short of a length, gets inside the line to pull this to the right of deep square leg for two. It is difficult to field in the dew because it is hard to predict how fast the ball is coming at you"

9.3,"Nagarkoti, to Buttler, no run","full and straight, driven hard to cover. The wet ball skids fast. Morgan fumbles. They don't run off the misfield"

9.1,"Nagarkoti, to Tewatia, no run","short of a length, wicket to wicket, pushed back to him"

8.3,"Narine to Buttler, no run","fuller, quicker, pushed to extra cover again"
8.2,"Narine to Buttler, no run","carrom ball, he sees it turn, punches it to cover"
8.1,"Narine to Buttler, SIX runs","majestic. Buttler goes deep into the crease, and loft him like a seamer off a length. No turn there so he afford to do that. Clears long-on with ease"
7.6,"Nagarkoti, to Tewatia, FOUR runs","full and wide, trying to stay out of his reach, but Tewatia reaches it and goes over extra cover for a four. And so it begins to turn again"
7.5,"Nagarkoti, to Tewatia, no run","cut in front of square this time, but straight to extra cover"
7.4,"Nagarkoti, to Tewatia, 2 runs","lands equidistant from three fielders converging on this. Tewatia looks for the upper-cut to this short ball, but he clears point, and it falls between third man and deep cover running towards it"
7.3,"Nagarkoti, to Buttler, 1 leg bye","short of a length again, Buttler looks to pull again, but this is not short enough and hits the pad for a leg-bye"
7.2,"Nagarkoti, to Buttler, FOUR runs","short of a length, into the body, and even though Buttler is down the wicket, he plays the short-arm pull and beats deep square leg. Quick outfield does the rest"

6.6,"Narine to Tewatia, no run","nails the big reverse-sweep, but can't beat cover-point"
6.5,"Narine to Tewatia, no run","slower in the air, Tewatia looks for the turn, but this goes straight on to hit the inside half of the bat"
6.4,"Narine to Buttler, 1 run","carrom ball, takes the leading edge as he looks to work this to leg. It goes into the covers for one"

5.1,"Varun to Buttler, 1 run","on a length, straight, worked to leg for one"
4.6,"Cummins to Parag, OUT","and the third over does the trick. He might not have got Buttler but he has got another wicket. Short ball, at his body, no room. Parag tries to get inside the line to help it to leg, but he is late on it, and Karthik takes the catch"
4.5,"Cummins to Parag, no run","short of a length, on off, Parag is on his toes to defend with an open face"
4.4,"Cummins to Parag, no run","on a length, headed for top of off. Defended"

4.2,"Cummins to Buttler, 1 run","on a length, straight, he gets inside the line to work this to leg for one"
4.1,"Cummins to Buttler, FOUR runs","and Buttler doesn't have a negative bone in his body. Dreamy as ever. This is short of a length, not too wide, and he has punched this through extra cover. All hands"
3.6,"Shivam Mavi to Parag, no run","wicket-maiden as he leaves one alone outside off. Looking to win it inside 14 overs one moment, leaving alone balls the next. The drunken pendulum keeps swinging"
3.5,"Shivam Mavi to Parag, no run","full, looking for swing, pushed wide of point, and it takes a full-length dive from the man. They don't even look for the single"
3.4,"Shivam Mavi to Parag, no run","on a length, angling in, top of off. Defended"
3.3,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, OUT","Mavi into it. Get in, KKR. This is a huge wicket. McCullum said earlier the ball will move around. Tripathi said it seamed around early. And this one moves off the surface just enough to take the edge. This is on a length, Samson looks to drive on the up, and edges it through"
3.2,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, no run","full, outside off, but Samson has taken a backward step now. RR need to regroup. Pushes this to cover"
3.1,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, no run","on a length, straight, defended to mid-on"
2.6,"Cummins to Smith, OUT",oh the adrenalin is flowing. Cummins gets his former captain. Again he nearly beats the inside edge of the shuffling Smith. The last time the inside edge saved him from a dead lbw. This time it drags the ball from outside off to top the of the leg stump
2.5,"Cummins to Smith, no run",inside edge. Cummins look to get his former Test captain with a blueprint that most sides need. Beat his inside edge as he shuffles across. He just gets the inside edge
2.4,"Cummins to Smith, FOUR runs","short of a length, into the body, Smith gets inside the line, tucks it square of short fine leg. There is a deep square leg in place, but this outfield is quick. And quickened further by the dew"
2.3,"Cummins to Smith, no run","on a length, just outside off, pushed to mid-on"
2.2,"Cummins to Samson, 1 run","full, middle and leg, clipped away to deep square leg for one"
2.1,"Cummins to Stokes, OUT","oh a flying Karthik spotted. Stokes gets a slot ball, goes for the bog drive, gets a think edge, Karthik is wrong-footed and has to dive to his left. He goes full-length, and the ball sticks in the left webbing. And he does well to bring the right hand around as his elbow hits the ground"
1.6,"Shivam Mavi to Stokes, 1 run","short of a length, on the pads, worked to leg for one"
1.5,"Shivam Mavi to Stokes, FOUR runs","crunched away. Down the wicket, turns this length ball into a half-volley, and drives him through cover for four"
1.4,"Shivam Mavi to Stokes, 2 runs","full and straight, Stokes gets an inside edge into the leg side, and he has come back for a two that doesn't exist and has been made it with a dive. He is really high on adrenalin"
1.3,"Shivam Mavi to Stokes, no run","nearly a return catch. Stokes looks to go to leg, and this length ball sits in the surface and hits him high on the bat. Doesn't carry to the bowler"
1.3,"Shivam Mavi to Stokes, 1 wide",good bouncer. Stokes bails out after shaping up for the hook. Oh he has got this just too high. Called wide
1.2,"Shivam Mavi to Stokes, no run","down the wicket, Mavi shortens the length, and he drives this into the wicket at the non-striker's end"
1.1,"Shivam Mavi to Stokes, no run","short of a length, wicket to wicket, Stokes has to abort his back lift and push this to mid-off"
0.6,"Cummins to Uthappa, OUT","and what cricket. Every match should be played with an eye on NRR. Just big hits and wickets. Uthappa plays the pick-up shot again to a full ball, but this time he is dragging it from outside off, which means he needs more power. He hasn't imparted it, and he has found the man at deep backward square leg"
0.5,"Cummins to Stokes, 1 run","short of a length, at him, punched wide of mid-off for one"
0.4,"Cummins to Stokes, SIX runs","this is ridiculous. Ramp to a length ball wide outside off, and he has had to use a flick of the wrist because it is wide and slightly short of the perfect length for the ramp. He manages to send it over fine leg for six"
0.3,"Cummins to Stokes, FOUR runs","Stokes is not going to die wondering either. He makes room to go through covers, and gets a bottom edge on a skiddy length ball, and past short fine leg it goes"
0.2,"Cummins to Stokes, no run","short of a length, at him, punched back to Cummins as there is no room available"
0.2,"Cummins to Uthappa, 2 wide","big wide down the leg side, and a flying Karthik saves three byes by getting a hand to it"
0.1,"Cummins to Uthappa, SIX runs","a cute little pick-up shot for a six first ball. Cummins bowls length, just slides down a little, and he uses all the pace of Cummins to flick him over long leg"
19.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Morgan, SIX runs","and Morgan hits the third one for a six. Tyagi misses the yorker, puts this in the slot, and Morgan clears the front leg to loft him back over his head for a six"
19.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Morgan, no run","another single turned down. If you turn down one on the fourth ball, you might as well do it off the fifth too. if you back yourself, back yourself all the way"
19.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Morgan, no run","full, outside off, drilled hard to long-off. Turns down the single"
19.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Nagarkoti,, 1 run",low full toss. driven down to long-on for one
19.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Cummins, OUT","full and wide, out of his reach, Cummins drives, gets the edge, and Samson takes it. Not only is this a dot, Morgan is still off strike"
19.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Cummins, 2 runs","misses the yorker by a foot, driven hard down the ground, between the two boundary riders. Gets a couple"
18.6,"Stokes to Morgan, FOUR runs","on-pace, short of a length, not much room, but Morgan leans back to cut him between point and short third man for four more"
18.5,"Stokes to Morgan, SIX runs","too predictable with slower ones. What's more? It is in the slot. Morgan sits back, and lofts him over long-off for a high six"
18.4,"Stokes to Morgan, SIX runs","down the wicket, creates all the momentum into a slower ball and lofts him over long-on. His first fifty of this IPL"
18.3,"Stokes to Cummins, 1 run","on-pace yorker, dug out for a single"
18.2,"Stokes to Cummins, SIX runs","I think Cummins has been watching Stokes has been bowling a lot of slower balls so he sits back and waits for this to arrive, and picks it from the slot to crash him over long-off"
18.1,"Stokes to Morgan, 1 run","short of a length, no room, dabbed away for one"
17.6,"Archer to Cummins, no run",sharp bouncer to end his spell. Cummins ducks it
17.5,"Archer to Morgan, 1 leg bye","beats him for pace with a quick length ball, hits the pad, but this is headed down leg. This has hit him between the pad and thigh pad"
17.4,"Archer to Cummins, 1 run","nearly a yorker again, punched to mid-off, takes the single on, he is gone if Smith hits. He misses"
17.3,"Archer to Cummins, 2 runs","quick length ball, Cummins gets more height than length on the slog, but there is no deep midwicket in place to take the catch"
17.2,"Archer to Cummins, 2 runs","nearly a yorker, but Summins has punched this powerfully down the ground. And so quick is this wet outfield that it has gone almost all the way to the long-off fence. Stokes runs to his left from long-on, puts the dive in, and saves two runs"
17.1,"Archer to Cummins, no run","Cummins backs away, and Archer slips in a yorker just outside off"
16.6,"Stokes to Morgan, FOUR runs","can't protect the over. Short of a length, slower ball, on off, and he waits for it to finally make connection with cut. Beats the man inside the circle, and also deep cover"
16.5,"Stokes to Cummins, 1 leg bye","quick length ball, following him, hits the thigh pad. Just the leg-bye"
16.4,"Stokes to Morgan, 1 run","shuffles across, Stokes bowls a slower ball to do him in, Morgan pushes this to his left, but Superman Stokes not only catches up with it, he throws off-balance to catch Morgan short. Just not able to hit it direct"
16.3,"Stokes to Morgan, no run","on-pace short ball, out of his reach, beats the cut again. Three dots"
16.2,"Stokes to Morgan, no run","slower bouncer, just outside off, beats his upper-cut"
16.1,"Stokes to Morgan, no run","slower ball, nearly a yorker, surprises him. Dot"
15.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Morgan, 1 leg bye",again hits the heel of Morgan. Superb comeback after those two sixes. Just the leg-bye
15.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Morgan, no run","yorker, outside leg, draws a dot by hitting his heel"
15.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Cummins, 1 run","now gets closer to the yorker mark, dug out to deep cover for one"
15.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Russell, OUT","big grunt from Russell as he has found deep cover to perfection. Tyagi misses the wide yorker by a foot or so, which means Russell sees a six over cover, but ends up hitting this straight to the man. He is really upset with himself"
15.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Russell, SIX runs","No. 2. Full, in the slot, just a touch wide, and Russell clears the front leg again and hits over long-off. Doesn't get all of it, but enough of it"
15.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Russell, SIX runs","that is No. 1 for this over. On a length, on-pace, in the slot, and he cleared the front leg and hit it flat over long-on"
14.6,"Archer to Morgan, no run","short, quick, 147ks, chest-high, and beats Morgan on the upper-cut"
14.5,"Archer to Morgan, no run","slower ball, cramps him up with this length ball. Dot ball"
14.4,"Archer to Russell, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, fended down past point for one"
14.3,"Archer to Russell, SIX runs","Russell has arrived. Short ball, doesn't get too big, and he clears the front leg to pull this for a flat six over forward square leg"
14.2,"Archer to Russell, FOUR runs","nearly a wicket. Short of a length, gets big at him, takes the outside edge and goes wide of the keeper"
14.1,"Archer to Russell, no run","starts off with a slower ball, on a length, on off. Defended"
13.6,"Gopal to Morgan, SIX runs","and just like that KKR are right back into the game. Twice in this match, Smith has let them back in by bowling Gopal. Short again, skidding nicely onto the bat, and he has pulled this over wide long-on"
13.5,"Gopal to Morgan, SIX runs","in the slot, and Morgan won't need second invitations. Over long-off he goes. RR have six bowlers. Did they need to continue bowling Gopal?"
13.4,"Gopal to Morgan, FOUR runs","short, wide again, and he cuts him over extra cover, and deliberately so. Gopal is not having a great night out"
13.3,"Gopal to Morgan, FOUR runs","that is dew for you. Slider, outside off, and he has mistimed this straight back, and it keeps sliding on. No signs of slowing down at all, and beats long-off"
13.2,"Gopal to Russell, 1 run","skips down the wicket and makes room too, Gopal follows him, draws an inside edge for one"
13.1,"Gopal to Russell, no run","big wind-up, Gopal stays short of his swinging arc. And is straight too. Defended back to him"
12.6,"Tewatia to Morgan, no run","slider, quick, just outside off, opens the face to short third man"
12.5,"Tewatia to Russell, 1 run","big wind-up, Tewatia stays away from the swinging arc, so he dabs on it for a single past slip"
12.4,"Tewatia to Russell, no run","quick slider, hits him high on the bat as he defends"
12.3,"Tewatia to Karthik, OUT","the big wicket. Karthik plays for the turn, Tewatia has bowled a straighter one, and the inside edge goes to short midwicket. This is when you pay for those monstrous edges. This is an inside edge, and he is just pushing at it, but it has carried all the way to short midwicket"
12.2,"Tewatia to Morgan, 1 run","full, middle and leg, driven to long-on for one"
12.1,"Tewatia to Morgan, FOUR runs","nearly back-to-back wickets. Breaks a 14-ball boundary drought with the sweep, but he hasn't nailed this sweep. Parag charges to his left from deep midwicket, but can't reach it"
11.6,"Gopal to Tripathi, OUT","nice catch by Uthappa, running to his left from long-on and taking this high by his head and while still running. Tripathi looks to pull this skiddy delivery, and gets a sort of top edge"
11.5,"Gopal to Morgan, 1 run","falls just short of short third man. Morgan looks to punch this over extra cover, but gets a healthy edge. Aaron thinks it is carrying to him, but it dies in front and beats his dive"
11.5,"Gopal to Morgan, 1 wide",sides one out of the front of the hand. Too wide outside off
11.4,"Gopal to Morgan, 2 runs","wrong'un, outside off, pulled wide of long-on for two"
11.3,"Gopal to Tripathi, 1 run","short of a length, skidding through, hurries him into the pull. Just the single to long-on"
11.2,"Gopal to Tripathi, no run","slider, quick, skids through, takes the inside edge, just misses the leg stump"

10.6,"Tewatia to Morgan, 1 run","slow, full, straight, just a single to long-on"
10.5,"Tewatia to Morgan, no run","down the wicket, Tewatia slows it down again, and Morgan is hit on the cue end. Dot"
10.4,"Tewatia to Tripathi, 1 run","flatter slider, punched to deep midwicket for one"
10.3,"Tewatia to Tripathi, no run","sees him come down, slows it down, slips it wide, draws a defensive shot"
10.2,"Tewatia to Morgan, 1 run","you could predict the reverse-sweep coming from a mile. He gets past short third, but can't beat the chase of deep point, who must be there just for this shot"
10.1,"Tewatia to Tripathi, 1 run","slider, on a length, punched down to long-on for one"
9.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Morgan, no run","short of a length, no room, pushes with an open face, but straight to point"
9.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Morgan, 2 runs","Morgan is not going to die wondering. Skips down the wicket, and punches this shortish ball past extra cover for two"
9.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Morgan, SIX runs","bouncer, looking to follow him as he backs away, but Morgan manages to get inside the line and pull this fine for a six over fine leg. All that pace can be your enemy if you slide down leg"
9.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Morgan, no run","short of a length, no room, he opens the face, but can't beat Tewatia at point"
9.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Tripathi, 1 run","length ball, outside off, driven to the right of deep cover, but they won't take Miller on for the second"
9.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Morgan, 1 run","on a length, outside off, driven on the up, single to deep cover"
8.6,"Tewatia to Narine, OUT","Narine tries to hit a six second ball. He clears the front leg to try to go over long-on, and skies this slider for Stokes to take at wide long-on. Not a bad move, not bad intent, but the result is a two-ball duck"
8.5,"Tewatia to Narine, no run","full, middle and off, no turn. Pushed to cover"
8.4,"Tewatia to Tripathi, 1 run",would have been a wide had Tripathi not cut this straight to deep cover
8.3,"Tewatia to Gill, OUT","top edge on the slog sweep, and Buttler is under it. You can start walking. This is a length ball, pretty straight, and hasn't turned. Still Gill doesn't get all of the slog sweep, and deep midwicket does the rest"
8.2,"Tewatia to Tripathi, 1 run","short again, pulled this time, just the single to wide long-on"
8.1,"Tewatia to Tripathi, FOUR runs","short, wide, cut in the air, just past point, and deep cover can't get to it"
7.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Tripathi, 1 run","full and straight, just the single to long-on. The first non-Archer over to not concede a boundary"
7.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Tripathi, no run","bouncer, just 129ks, might have been the slower one, and beats Tripathi's attempt to upper-cut him"
7.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to the sweeper. Buttler is doing an excellent job there. Last ball to his left, this time to his right. Only singles"

7.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, dabbed in front of backward point for one"

6.5,"Tewatia to Tripathi, SIX runs","down the wicket, gets under a length ball, extends his arms through it, and clears long-on with ease. Terrific intent from KKR"
6.5,"Tewatia to Tripathi, 1 wide","slider, wide down the leg side"
6.4,"Tewatia to Tripathi, no run","slow wide legbreak, Tripathi beaten on the sweep, Samson breaks the wicket. The replays show the back foot is grounded"
6.3,"Tewatia to Gill, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, worked to leg for one"
6.2,"Tewatia to Tripathi, 1 run","superb shot, even better fielding. Tripathi down the wicket to drill this wide of long-off, but Stokes rushes to his left, puts the dive in, and keeps them down to just one"
6.1,"Tewatia to Tripathi, no run","full, on off, driven back to him"
5.6,"Aaron to Gill, FOUR runs","slower ball, but it swings down leg too far, and the fine leg is up. Clipped away for an easy boundary. The inswinging knuckle ball"

5.2,"Aaron to Tripathi, FOUR runs","top shot. Makes room early, Aaron follows him with a short-of-a-length ball, and he punches this from outside leg to place this between cover and cover-point"
5.1,"Aaron to Gill, 1 run","slower ball, 117ks, cuts back in, hits the inside half of the bat on the bi drive. They will sneak in the single"
4.6,"Stokes to Tripathi, SIX runs","just clears deep backward square leg. Not in control of this hook at all, Tewatia settles himself under the top edge, but he is not tall enough for this"
4.5,"Stokes to Gill, 1 run","into the body, worked away to deep square leg for one"
4.4,"Stokes to Tripathi, 1 run","slower ball, Tripathi way early into the cover-drive, gets an inside edge to mid-on for one"

4.1,"Stokes to Gill, no run","wide length ball, pushed to short cover"
3.6,"Gopal to Tripathi, FOUR runs","that sweep earlier sent the deep midwicket to deep square leg, and Gopal proceeds to bowl short, and Tripathi pulls this to deep midwicket for four"
3.5,"Gopal to Tripathi, no run","wrong'un, he goes back to punch it, but can't beat cover-point"
3.4,"Gopal to Tripathi, FOUR runs","swept away first ball. On a length, outside off, and Tripathi gets stuck into him and goes over square leg. This is proving to be a costly decision to bowl Gopal in the Powerplay"
3.3,"Gopal to Gill, 1 run","flighted outside off, pushed to mid-off for one"
3.2,"Gopal to Gill, FOUR runs","too short, and Gill goes back to pull this, and he has out this in the gape between long-on and deep midwicket. Stokes puts in a full-length dive to his right, gets a hand to it, but the ball keeps rolling on. The outfield is quick"
3.1,"Gopal to Gill, FOUR runs","just clears mid-off. A languid like off-drive in the air, and he has just cleared Archer there"
2.6,"Archer to Tripathi, no run","they have done well to get out of this over unscathed. There might be a bruise or two under the pads, but no wicket lost. Archer is quick and short of a length again, and this time Tripathi defends it"
2.5,"Archer to Gill, 1 run","in the batsman's half this time, pushed wide of mid-on for a single"
2.4,"Archer to Gill, no run","short of a length, rising, 148ks, fended to point, who is in tight"
2.3,"Archer to Tripathi, 1 run","again he hits his body even before he can react. This is at 145ks, and is following him after pitching short of a length. He gets the leg-bye this time. Non-striker's is a better place to watch Archer from"
2.2,"Archer to Tripathi, no run","quick, short of a length, 147ks, hits his thigh pad even before he can react"
2.1,"Archer to Tripathi, no run","short ball, at his body, and Tripathi ducks it. Not even one for the over"
1.6,"Aaron to Gill, FOUR runs","this is exciting cricket. No one holding back punches. Aaron goes for a bouncer, Gill goes for the hook. In front of square he goes. Four more"
1.5,"Aaron to Gill, FOUR runs","lovely shot. On-pace, on a length, at his wicket, and he plays the pick-up over midwicket. Joy to watch"
1.4,"Aaron to Gill, no run","slower ball, 120ks, on a length, wide outside off, beats his expansive drive"
1.3,"Aaron to Gill, FOUR runs","short of a length, into the ribs, a languid short-arm pull, and this outfield is electric. Beats long leg even though he doesn't have too far to go to his left"

1.1,"Aaron to Gill, no run","short of a length, outside off, punched to cover-point"
0.6,"Archer to Tripathi, no run","bouncer, not too high, he ducks it. Slightly down leg, but not called wide"
0.5,"Archer to Tripathi, no run","backs away to try to cut, Archer stays short of a length, and beats him with the pace and the bounce"
0.4,"Archer to Tripathi, no run","cuts him in half. This is short of a length, and nips back in, and beats the inside edge. Over the stumps its goes"
0.3,"Archer to Tripathi, no run","full and quick, defended back to him"
0.2,"Archer to Rana, OUT","golden duck for Rana. Oh hang on. He has reviewed with one second to go. That is strange. This is not an lbw decision, but a catch at the wicket. It shouldn't take you 14 seconds to make up your mind on these. Archer has dug this in short, gets it chest high, and the Snicko shows there is a scratch as this goes past his fend. Rana, and the review, both gone"
0.1,"Archer to Gill, 1 run","and nearly a third. Leading edge first ball, but the third man is back and square, which means the point is in front of square. And this flies through backward point"
18.5,"Gayle to Rayudu, 1 run","misfield at cover and that is it for both teams this season. Full and just outside off, driven hurredly into the covers and it's past the dive"

17.5,"Shami to Gaikwad, 2 runs","slower short ball outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
17.4,"Shami to Gaikwad, no run",good length outside off. Swishes inside the line of that on the front foot and is beaten
17.3,"Shami to Gaikwad, FOUR runs","spanked over midwicket. Nothing awkward about this. Short one again, but about stomach height. Presses deep into the crease and then springs out at this with a clean swipe"
17.2,"Shami to Gaikwad, 4 leg byes",awkward fend flies over the keeper. Bounce rises sharply at a middle stump line. Looked like a top edge to me as he looked to withdraw from his attempted pull
17.1,"Shami to Rayudu, 1 run",short of a length and cutting into his body as he drops this into the leg side with soft hands. Took a walk for the most part of that run and was forced to hurry as Neesham threw at the non-striker's end
16.6,"Jordan to Rayudu, 1 run","full and into off stump, makes room and mistimes the drive to mid-off"
16.5,"Jordan to Rayudu, FOUR runs","slapped to the extra cover boundary. Slower ball at a length, wide outisde off. Steps out, makes room and reaches out to flat-bat that"

15.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gaikwad, 1 run","good length on off stump, nudged into the covers off the back foot"

14.6,"Ashwin to Rayudu, 1 run","googly at a length onto leg stump, nudged to deep square"
14.5,"Ashwin to Rayudu, no run","sounds like that's a dropped catch. Short and wide outside off, steps out and is forced to cut because he's not to the pitch. And yes, there is an edge that pops out of Rahul's gloves"

13.6,"Neesham to Gaikwad, FOUR runs","punches it late and beats both backward point running backwards and sweeper running to the left. It's a short of a length ball outside off, he allows it on and opens the face very very late to place this"

13.4,"Neesham to Rayudu, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, looks to drive on the up, gets it to long-on off the toe-end"

13.2,"Neesham to Rayudu, no run","good length at off stump, defended off the back foot"
13.1,"Neesham to Gaikwad, 3 runs",legcutter at a length outside off. Waits on it and taps it into the vacant midwicket region. Pooran runs in and puts in a sharp throw at the non-striker's end that isn't collected. an extra run at extra cover

12.1,"Ashwin to Rayudu, no run","full and just outside off, jammed into the covers"

9.6,"Jordan to Gaikwad, 2 runs","slower ball, short of a length at leg stump. Patted through midwicket off the back foot"
9.5,"Jordan to du Plessis, OUT","Rahul grabs it running to his left. Slower ball at a good length outside off. Jumps into the off side for the ramp. Ends up miscuing it and it floats to Rahul's left. He's held on and appears to have made a faux appeal with both hands outstretched. Can't tell without a wider shot if that is aimed at the third umpire, but there's a good chance it is"
9.4,"Jordan to du Plessis, 2 runs","slower ball, short of a length on leg stump. Nudged to deep square off the back foot"

7.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gaikwad, no run","Mandeep lunges forward to take it at backward point. They've sent it up with a soft signal out. It's a googly, gripping in the pitch at a good length outside off. He leans in for the square drive and ends up slicing it. Mandeep goes low to his left and forward. He seems to to have taken it cleanly but as soon as his hands make contact with the ground, it looks like they've split and the ball has hit the turf. Or so the umpire thinks. KL Rahul is protesting that with the on-field umpires, who simply tell him to get on with it. Shakes of the head from KXIP players"
7.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to du Plessis, 1 run","full googly outside off, shuffles and sweeps to deep midwicket's right"

6.3,"Ashwin to du Plessis, no run","catch taken down leg side and Faf review the decision right away. It's a googly at a length, spinning into him. He's playing the glance and it's off the thigh, it appears. Yes. It was a big deflection, so you can see why the umpire might have thought that was bat. A good take from Rahul."
6.2,"Ashwin to Gaikwad, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
6.1,"Ashwin to du Plessis, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
5.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gaikwad, no run","good length and onto the pads, flicked to midwicket off the front foot"
5.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to du Plessis, 3 leg byes","good length and spinning down leg side. Tickled fine off the back foot. Shami chases it and flicks the ball back in with his heel. Stepped right onto the ball there and there are at least a few coaches and possibly the Indian captain questioning his decision to do that before a big tour. In the end, it's all safe and he's done no damage"
5.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to du Plessis, no run","short of a length googly, into middle stump. Squeezed into the extra cover region off the back foot"
5.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to du Plessis, no run","big lbw appeal is turned down. A slider at a length, onto leg stump. Can't get the flick away. Probably sliding down leg. Yes it is."
5.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to du Plessis, SIX runs","and now lofted casually over mid-off! Good length outside off, does grip into the pitch somewhat, but he reaches out and lofts it on the rise to make sweet contact"

4.2,"Shami to Gaikwad, 1 run","good length and just outside off, dropped into the point region with soft hands"
4.1,"Shami to Gaikwad, FOUR runs","oh pristine. Full ball outside off, gets neatly into this with a half stride and then leans onto the front leg as he opens the face to punch between cover and extra"
19.6,"Ngidi to Hooda, 1 run","thick inside edge to midwicket. Sets up outside off again, it's a full toss again, but he miscues the slog"
19.5,"Ngidi to Hooda, SIX runs",swung away over square leg. A bit predictable here from CSK and Ngidi. He's already camping well outside off for that line. Ngidi misses on his full slower ball. It hits up at knee height for him and he sends it far back
19.4,"Ngidi to Jordan, 1 bye","beaten on the slog. Full dipping slower ball outside off, looks to go leg side and that's past him. They run through. Dhoni misses the stumps with his throw. Ngidi picks it up and flicks onto the stumps at the other end, but third umpire confirms Jordan was in"
19.3,"Ngidi to Hooda, 1 run","full slower ball outside off, driven to sweeper's right and can't pinch the second"
19.2,"Ngidi to Hooda, FOUR runs",carved to long-off's left. Full and just outside off. Shuffled a long way and waited for it outside off and then opened the face to pick his spot with the drive
19.1,"Ngidi to Jordan, 1 run","length and wide outside off, lofted out towards sweeper cover"
18.6,"Thakur to Jordan, 1 run","full slower ball, wide outside off. Reaches out and drives to sweeper's right"

18.4,"Thakur to Jordan, 2 runs","length on leg stump, nudged to midwicket's right off the back foot"
18.3,"Thakur to Hooda, 1 run","slower short ball at middle stump, has to adjust and get this pull to short fine's left. Can't beat him, but that is a very impressive fifty for Hooda in a must-win game. Been proactive and found ways to keep his scoring rate high as the others have struggled on this surface"
18.2,"Thakur to Hooda, FOUR runs","steps out and carves it over extra cover. Full slower ball outside off, quickly to the pitch of it with his feet down leg side to create room. Funds his spot to perfection"
18.1,"Thakur to Hooda, 2 runs","slower ball at a length on leg stump, nudges it into vacant midwicket and shouts immediately for the two that they've managed comfortably"
17.6,"Ngidi to Hooda, 1 run",full dipping slower ball outside off. One-handed poke out to long-off
17.6,"Ngidi to Hooda, 1 wide","slower ball, short of a length and wide outside off. Left alone"
17.5,"Ngidi to Hooda, 2 runs","length ball outside off, shuffles and opens the face to run this to deep point's right"
17.4,"Ngidi to Hooda, SIX runs",drilled over extra cover this time! In the slot and wide outside off. He shuffles to get in line of that and once again a beautiful extension of the arms to transfer his weight through this lofted drive. Picturesque from Hooda
17.3,"Ngidi to Hooda, no run","a review for catch behind fueled entirely by the bowler's enthusiasm. It's a yorker past the tramline. Hooda looks to chop at that. He's definitely hit the ground as he attempts it. The bat face is open and there is a shadow on the bat as the ball goes past it, says the umpire. Sharp observation, that. And then he uses the angle from behind the keeper to confirm that there is gap between bat and all"
17.2,"Ngidi to Hooda, SIX runs",sliced over the point boundary. Full and wide outside off. Reaches out and deliberately opens the face to get it well fine of the sweeper fielder
17.1,"Ngidi to Neesham, OUT","a diving catch to the right by Gaikwad! At deep midwicket. This pitch could be Ngidi's BFF, the way he's understood it today. Around the wicket, dug into the pitch short of a good length outside off. Neesham shapes for his favoured swipe over midwicket, but the slow pace on that makes him get a lot more elevation than he's like. Then, Gaikwad tracks it brilliantly with a sprint to his right and lunges with perfect timing to take that and then hold on"
16.6,"Jadeja to Hooda, 2 runs","length at middle stump, shuffles and nudges it into midwicket with soft hands"
16.5,"Jadeja to Neesham, 1 run",short of a length slider with a low arm action. Outside off. Gets back and clips to deep square

16.3,"Jadeja to Neesham, 1 run","good length on leg stump, pushed towards long-on from the crease"
16.2,"Jadeja to Mandeep, OUT",slides onto off stump. Short of a length and coming on with the arm. He's deep in the crease trying to whip across the line but that keeps low and is under the angled bat

15.6,"Tahir to Hooda, 1 run","good length at middle stump, shuffles and stabs it into vacant midwicket"
15.5,"Tahir to Hooda, SIX runs","crunched over extra cover! What a shot that is. A function of Hooda's reach, for the most part, and then the extension of the arms. It's a floaty legbreak outside off and he gets on his knee and swings cleanly from under that"
15.4,"Tahir to Mandeep, 1 run","good length on leg stump, nudged through midwicket with soft hands"
15.3,"Tahir to Hooda, 1 run","just short of long-on. Low full toss outside off, wants to whip that wide of mid-on but picks him out"
15.2,"Tahir to Hooda, 2 runs",good length and sliding onto off stump. Pushed towards deep midwicket with soft hands
15.1,"Tahir to Mandeep, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
14.6,"Jadeja to Hooda, 2 runs","good length at middle stump, steps out and flicks to deep midwicket's right. Gaikwad fumbles and they come back for the second on the long throw"

14.4,"Jadeja to Mandeep, 1 run",

14.2,"Jadeja to Hooda, no run",good length and into the pads as he leans in for the flick. Deflects into the off side
14.1,"Jadeja to Mandeep, 1 run","full and into leg stump, leans in and flicks through square leg"
13.6,"Chahar to Hooda, FOUR runs",beats deep square's dive to the right. Another slower ball dug in too short. Gets big on him but he gets on his toes and swipes handsomely to that fielder's right
13.5,"Chahar to Mandeep, 1 run","good length just outside off, opens the face and runs it to third man"
13.4,"Chahar to Mandeep, no run","slower ball at a length just outside off, dropped pitch side on the off side. Backward point is too quick for them to steal a single"
13.3,"Chahar to Hooda, 1 run",slower length ball outside off. Shapes to drive that but it sticks and he's forced to adjust and tap that down to long-on
13.2,"Chahar to Mandeep, 1 run","good length and just outside off, steered down to third man"
13.1,"Chahar to Mandeep, FOUR runs","nicely placed between fine leg and deep square. First boundary since the powerplay. Slower ball, short of a length outside off. Waited on that as he shifted his weight back and rolled the wrists to get this pull into the ground"
12.6,"Jadeja to Hooda, 2 runs","length and just outside off, stabbed to short third man's right and a misfield allows them the second"

12.1,"Jadeja to Hooda, no run","good length outside off, pushed to extra cover off the front foot"
11.6,"Tahir to Hooda, 1 run","good length outside off, leans into that and flicks to deep midwicket"
11.5,"Tahir to Gayle, OUT","that looks plumb on first viewing. Gayle reviews this lbw, hoping it's spinning past leg stump. He's down for a sweep and struck on the knee roll, right in front of middle stump. It's definitely pitched in line. Ultra Edge confirms no bat on it. And before ball tracking is even ready, Gayle has seen enough and is walking towards the dugout because that is dead in front. Pitching in line, hitting middle stump. Three reds. Tahir is pointing happily to someone in the dugout. Snuck past the sweep and now the squeeze is well and truly on"
11.4,"Tahir to Mandeep, 1 run","low full toss on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
11.3,"Tahir to Gayle, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven down to long-on"

10.4,"Thakur to Pooran, OUT",inside edge is taken behind! Short of a length and rising at middle stump. Clears the front leg and looks for the big pull. A thin edge as he gets cramped a touch

10.2,"Thakur to Pooran, 1 run","full and just outside off, lifted to deep extra cover's left"

8.5,"Ngidi to Pooran, no run","slower short ball outside off, beaten on the cut"
8.4,"Ngidi to Pooran, no run","good length and just outside off, punched to extra cover's right. His dive only helps him parry that towards mid-off"
8.3,"Ngidi to Rahul, OUT",dips under his sweep and bowls him! Beautiful bowling from Ngidi. A full slower ball at off stump and once again he's deceived him. He's looking to shovel that past short fine as it loops at him and tonks off stump
8.2,"Ngidi to Rahul, no run",beaten on the outside edge. Short of a length slower ball dug into the pitch. Wants to lift that over mid-off but it grips and gets big on him
8.1,"Ngidi to Gayle, 1 run","good length and wide outside off, thick inside edge past the stumps as he looks to drive on the up through cover"
7.6,"Tahir to Rahul, no run","short of a length and just outside off, cut straight to backward point"
7.5,"Tahir to Gayle, 1 run","good  length and just outside off, leans into the drive to long-off"

6.5,"Thakur to Rahul, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched on the rise to mid-off"
6.4,"Thakur to Rahul, no run",full and at the stumps. Backs away to open up the off side but can only jab this to extra cover
6.3,"Thakur to Rahul, no run","good length on middle stump, pushed to mid-on off the front foot"
6.2,"Thakur to Gayle, 1 run","short and just outside off, chopped down to third man"
6.1,"Thakur to Gayle, no run","good length and on the pads, flicked to midwicket"
5.6,"Ngidi to Rahul, no run","slower ball, short of a length and wide outside off. Left alone. It cuts back in to stay inside the tramline"
5.5,"Ngidi to Rahul, FOUR runs","full and just outside off, leans into that and drives to sweeper's right. Tahir slides and has over-done it. Has to reach out behind himself to try and grab it last-ditch, but he can't manage that"
5.4,"Ngidi to Gayle, 1 run","short of a length on off stump, dropped into the covers with soft hands"
5.3,"Ngidi to Gayle, no run",good length and angled across outside off. Left alone
5.2,"Ngidi to Agarwal, OUT","inside edge onto middle stump! Ngidi rolls the fingers on that and gets him. Short of a length and in the corridor. He's leaning back to try and play the pull shot, but is dragging from too wide outside off on a slow pitch"
5.1,"Ngidi to Agarwal, FOUR runs","driven to the wide long-off boundary. Good length and just outside off, gets a stride out and lofts it on the rise. Making full use of the fielding restrictions today. It's a slow-ish surface and grounded boundaries might not be as easy to get"
4.6,"Thakur to Rahul, no run","slower short ball just outside off, cut straight to backward point"
4.5,"Thakur to Rahul, no run",beaten on the pull. Short and outside off. Was looking to lift that over midwicket
4.4,"Thakur to Agarwal, 1 run","slower short ball, into off stump. Patted into the covers off the back foot"
4.3,"Thakur to Rahul, 1 run","good length on middle stump, nudged to mid-on"
4.2,"Thakur to Rahul, FOUR runs","slashed over short third. Didn't make an effort to keep his shape there. And it's not exactly a risky option given the field. Third man is in. Slower short of a length ball outside off, chucks his hands at that and gets four"
4.1,"Thakur to Rahul, FOUR runs",pick-up shot to the long leg boundary. Full and into the pads. Deep square is pretty straight and he closes the face to get this well fine of him
3.6,"Sam Curran to Agarwal, FOUR runs",whipped wide of mid-on. Such good wrists. It's a length ball that's sticking in the pitch at a leg stump line. He gets well in front of that pad and lifts it from under as it climbs up on him
3.5,"Sam Curran to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length and into leg stump, flicked out to deep square"
3.4,"Sam Curran to Rahul, no run",short ball at an off stump line. Walks down at that and is forced to leave it
3.3,"Sam Curran to Agarwal, 1 run",short of a length and into the stumps. Stabbed into the covers
3.2,"Sam Curran to Agarwal, FOUR runs",slashed over point. Good length and wide outside off. Gets the front foot stride out and reaches with an open face to lift that over the infield

2.6,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run",inside edge to short fine as he walks down and looks for the straight loft. Through his shot early. It's a full ball outside off
2.5,"Chahar to Agarwal, 1 run","full knuckle ball at leg stump, flicked to deep square's left"
2.4,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","full outside off, driven on the up to deep point"
2.3,"Chahar to Rahul, SIX runs","chopped over the third man boundary. Just strays a bit wide this time, and Rahul chops deliberately aerial as third man is in. Marginally short and wide outside off from Chahar"
2.2,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","good length and just outside off, punched on the up to extra cover"
2.1,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","good length and just outside off, punched off the back foot to extra cover"

1.4,"Sam Curran to Agarwal, no run","full and wide outside off, reaches out to drive that on the rise. It comes off the toe-end and trickles out to extra cover"

1.2,"Sam Curran to Agarwal, 1 run",full inswinger at middle stump. Check-punches to mid-off's right

0.3,"Chahar to Agarwal, no run","just short of midwicket. Good length at middle stump, closes the face early on the flick"
0.2,"Chahar to Agarwal, FOUR runs","just over mid-on. Good length outswinger just outside off. Comes on slowly off the pitch and Mayank waits on that, closes the face and lifts it on the rise to Rayudu's left"
0.1,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","good length outswinger, just outside off. Leans in and pushes to deep point off the front foot"
14.1,"Chahal to Holder, SIX runs","and Holder finishes it off with an incredible six. Short of a length, straight, and he nonchalantly uses his ling arms to punch this straight down the ground for a flat six"
13.6,"Saini to Holder, 1 run","full, straight and quick, driven down to long-on for one"
13.5,"Saini to Abhishek, OUT","wide length ball, Sharma looks to draw level in one shot, but gets too much under it and holes out to long-off"
13.4,"Saini to Abhishek, SIX runs","pace on the ball. It is your biggest enemy today. Saini just keeps giving them pace on the ball. Yes it is a top edge on the pull, but these are small boundaries. There is premium to be had on slower balls. It is gripping in the surface. And you keep giving them pace"
13.4,"Saini to Holder, 2 wide","full and fast, wide down the leg side. Called a wide. They get a bye too"
13.3,"Saini to Holder, FOUR runs","pace on, pace on. Yorker down leg, and he cue-ends it fine of fine leg"
13.2,"Saini to Holder, SIX runs","Saini keeps giving them the pace to use. And Holder keeps showing why he loves batting. And if you have followed him in international cricket, you know you don't bounce Holder. He has pulled another six. This one over square leg"
13.1,"Saini to Holder, no run","appeal for lbw first ball, and this looks good and straight, but it has hit Holder on the top of the pad. For a tall man, this might be sailing over. But RCB have reviewed the not-out decision. And there seems to be a scratch anyway as the ball passes the bat. So no need to even check the height. RCB lose the review because of the faint inside edge"
12.6,"Udana to Holder, 1 run","quicker, fuller, punched down to long-off for one"
12.5,"Udana to Holder, no run","slower ball, he edges it as he looks to run this down, but it is slow that it bounces twice before reaching the keeper"
12.4,"Udana to Holder, SIX runs","oh that shot is something. Nerves, what nerves? He gets pace on the ball, and this attempted bouncer is only waist high for the tall Holder. He pulls this over wide long-on for a six"
12.3,"Udana to Holder, 2 runs","too full, driven forward of deep cover for two"
12.2,"Udana to Holder, no run","short of a length, quick, skiddy, he gets a bottom edge on the dab"
12.1,"Udana to Williamson, OUT","and what a bowling change it has proved to be. Williamson has chipped one straight to short extra cover. Slower offcutter, on a length, and he ends up pushing at this well in front of his body. Easy catch to Kohli at extra cover. A soft dismissal. if you are not looking for a boundary, shots with hard hands are a soft dismissal on this pitch"
11.6,"Sundar to Abhishek, no run","full, just outside off, defended back to him"
11.5,"Sundar to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length, straight, pushed to deep backward square for one"
11.4,"Sundar to Abhishek, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to deep cover for one"
11.3,"Sundar to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length, down the leg side, turned around the corner for one"
11.2,"Sundar to Abhishek, 1 run","hard push at a length ball, ends up hitting this in the air, but above cover"
11.1,"Sundar to Williamson, 1 run","he starts off with a short ball, but it comes slow off the surface, and he pulls this along the ground to deep square leg"
10.6,"Chahal to Saha, OUT","beaten in the flight. It takes a lot to do that with a wet ball. Chahal manages to do that. Saha skips down the wicket to try to go over extra cover again, but the ball drops on him to fall short of where he is expecting it to. And then it rips past his bat to give de Villiers a regulation stumping"
10.5,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run","on a length, no turn, Williamson uses soft hands to dab down on it. Single to point"
10.4,"Chahal to Saha, 1 run","does him in the air as Saha looks for the extra cover, and he ends up chipping this full ball towards long-off for one"
10.3,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run","slow through the air, full, on the toes, driven down to long-on for one"
10.2,"Chahal to Saha, 1 run",looks for the paddle sweep but can't place it fine of short fine
10.1,"Chahal to Saha, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Right down to the pitch of the ball, opening up the front leg, and drilling this over midwicket for four"
9.6,"Udana to Williamson, no run","that bouncer is too high. Oh not called again. Williamson drops his wrists and sways out of its line. Even if not higher than the head, technically this is the second shoulder-high ball of the over after that beamer"
9.5,"Udana to Williamson, no run","slower bouncer, outside off, and squeezes under Williamson's attempted pull"
9.4,"Udana to Saha, 1 run",grips this drier ball better. Nearly a yorker outside off. Steered to third man for one
9.3,"Udana to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball gone wrong. High full toss down the leg side. Williamson has pulled this straight to fine leg. And they have got away with a blatant no-ball. This is chest-high, and not called a no-ball. Very lucky there, RCB. Williamson is not happy. He just stands and shakes his head quietly. Nearly shoulder high it was. In Kohli's world, Williamson would be reviewing this successfully and availing of a free hit for Saha"
9.2,"Udana to Saha, 1 run","on a length, quick, pushed to mid-off for one"
9.1,"Udana to Saha, FOUR runs","slips out as a full toss outside off, and he drives it through cover and forward of deep cover for four"
8.6,"Chahal to Saha, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, worked to leg for one"
8.5,"Chahal to Saha, no run","slow, high, down leg. Saha gets bat on the paddle sweep, but he has hit this straight to short fine"
8.4,"Chahal to Saha, no run","flat, quick, middle and leg, pushed to midwicket"
8.3,"Chahal to Williamson, 1 run","slow in the air, full, on the pads, nudged wide of midwicket for one"
8.2,"Chahal to Saha, 1 run",driven between Williamson's legs for a single
8.1,"Chahal to Saha, no run","Chahal is claiming a run-out here. Saha down the wicket to drive this straight, Chahal dives to his right, and claims to have got a finger on it, and the ball hits the stumps at the non-striker's. It has taken us a hundred replays to establish that it hasn't hit his finger. Rather, in the words of the third umpire, there is no conclusive evidence he touched it. Ruled not-out. And I think Williamson was back anyway. Animated discussion between Kohli and the on-field umpire"
7.6,"Udana to Williamson, no run","on a length, on-pace, 131ks, on top of off. Defended to short cover"
7.5,"Udana to Williamson, no run","bouncer, on-pace, 130ks, well outside off, and he ducks it"
7.4,"Udana to Williamson, no run","slower legcutter outside off, Williamson ends up pushing inside the line"
7.3,"Udana to Saha, 1 run","length ball, into the pads, 129ks, clipped to deep square leg for one"
7.2,"Udana to Saha, 2 runs","on-pace, into the pads, and he glances this fine of fine leg for two"
7.1,"Udana to Williamson, 1 run","starts off with a slower ball, Williamson uses soft hands to drop it at his feet and sneak in a single"
6.6,"Chahal to Saha, no run","short of a length, and turn again as Saha looks to pull to let. Gets an inside edge to short fine leg"
6.5,"Chahal to Saha, no run","turn and bounce outside off, and he runs this to short third man"
6.4,"Chahal to Pandey, OUT","Chahal shows he is good enough even with the wet ball. Pandey has been impatient all over, looking to take him down early. He looks to clear long-on as this is flighted invitingly again, and it dips and turns to take a massive edge for Morris to run in from long-on and catch"
6.3,"Chahal to Pandey, no run","looks for the big drive as he flights this, and still gets some dip to beat him in the air. Hit back to him"
6.2,"Chahal to Saha, 1 run","on a length, on off, punched down to long-off for one"
6.1,"Chahal to Pandey, 1 run","slow in the air, Pandey has to check his attempted off-drive, and plays this to deep cover for one"
5.6,"Siraj to Saha, no run","slower ball, middle and off, pushed to mid-on"
5.5,"Siraj to Saha, SIX runs","pace on ball, head high, and Saha hooks this sweetly into the roof behind long leg. Oh Saha, what timing. Even Kohli looks at it in awe"
5.4,"Siraj to Saha, no run","short of a length, quick, rising, and beats him as he looks to run this fine to third man"
5.3,"Siraj to Saha, 2 runs","bouncer, too high, but Saha goes for the hook. Would have been a wide had he not pulled this in front of square for a couple"
5.2,"Siraj to Saha, FOUR runs","length ball, mid-on up, and Saha picks his spot. Not the cleanest hit, but manages to clear mid-on"
5.1,"Siraj to Saha, no run","on a length, on off, driven on the up, but straight to mid-off"
4.6,"Morris to Pandey, FOUR runs","full, on-pace, down the leg side. Pandey gets an inside edge on this for four, but this one deserved to go anyway"
4.5,"Morris to Saha, 1 run","short of a length, no room, dabs on this for a single"
4.5,"Morris to Saha, 1 wide",another big wide down the leg side. He is lucky they have not got any bat on these wides
4.4,"Morris to Saha, 2 runs","short of a length, quick, good bounce, and he is unable to get power into a punch. But they will accept two gifted overthrows from cover. They are rattled here. Wild throws and poor backing up from the man in the deep on the leg side"
4.4,"Morris to Saha, 1 wide",big wide down the leg side. Saha will feel he has missed out
4.3,"Morris to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length, into the rib, looks to tickle it fine, but gets a glove to AB on the bounce. And they steal a single even though the fumble has gone only about two feet away from AB"
4.2,"Morris to Pandey, no run","short of a length, straight, punched down to mid-on"
4.2,"Morris to Pandey, 1 wide",wide down the leg side
4.1,"Morris to Pandey, FOUR runs","a slower ball to start off with, but Pandey checks his shot and flicks this over midwicket. He has picked the spot well here. The deep fielder is square"
3.6,"Sundar to Pandey, 1 run","quicker, fuller, driven down to long-on for one"
3.5,"Sundar to Pandey, no run","quick, on a length, pushed to short straight midwicket"
3.4,"Sundar to Saha, 1 run","on a length, straight, turned around the corner for one"
3.3,"Sundar to Saha, FOUR runs","I asked this question earlier because I know Saha sweeps very well. It doesn't matter this is bowled at 100ks, but he gets on a knee and helps this over square leg for four"
3.2,"Sundar to Saha, no run","on a length, outside off, punched to cover"
3.1,"Sundar to Pandey, 3 runs","nice shot. On a length, outside off, push-driven past cover for three. Kohli receives the throw at the non-striker's and lets it rip to the keeper. Showing his frustration that they are allowed to take three here"
2.6,"Saini to Saha, no run","short of a length, 140ks, lands on the seam and holds its line outside off. Beats his outside edge"
2.5,"Saini to Pandey, 1 run","full, quick and skiddy at 142ks. Pandey looks for the big drive again, but gets an inside edge onto the pad"
2.4,"Saini to Pandey, SIX runs","short, on-pace, 144ks, skiddy, and with dew on, this is not a good ball on these short boundaries. Pulled over square leg for six"
2.3,"Saini to Pandey, no run","a swipe across a length ball, bowled at 137s, and it beats him and goes over the leg stump by about a foot"
2.2,"Saini to Pandey, FOUR runs","that is like running around a ball and turning it into a forehand and hitting up the line. This is short of a length, into his body, and he punches this straight of mid-on for four"
2.1,"Saini to Pandey, no run","on a length, 140ks, punched on the up, but straight to mid-off"
1.6,"Sundar to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length, straight, punched down to long-on for one"
1.5,"Sundar to Pandey, no run","sharp turn, quick, played uppishly to square leg"
1.4,"Sundar to Pandey, no run","back to his length, just outside off, staying low. Pushed to cover"
1.3,"Sundar to Pandey, no run","on a length, outside off, extra bounce. Left alone"
1.2,"Sundar to Warner, OUT","Warner looks to dominate him after the first-ball six, but chooses the wrong length now. Sundar is a little fuller than the last ball, Warner is looking to clear midwicket but ends up going straight to mid-on"
1.1,"Sundar to Warner, SIX runs","a rare poor start from Sundar. A short ball, and the new ball skids on nicely for a pull over midwicket for six"
0.6,"Morris to Saha, no run","short of a length, wide, punched away square, and Philippe has to dive full length to his left at cover-point to save four runs here"
0.5,"Morris to Warner, 1 run","short of a length, wicket to wicket, but Warner makes room to push this past point for one"
0.4,"Morris to Warner, no run","wide length ball, Warner shapes up for the big drive, but then lets it go"
0.3,"Morris to Saha, 1 run","on a length, straight, worked to leg for one"

0.1,"Morris to Warner, 1 wide","short, wide, too wide"
19.6,"Natarajan to Gurkeerat, 1 leg bye",looks for the reverse-sweep/ramp. Natarajan stays full and straight. Just the one leg-bye
19.5,"Natarajan to Siraj, 1 run","full and straight, driven to extra cover for one. A bit of a helicopter again"
19.4,"Natarajan to Gurkeerat, 1 run","yorker outside off, dug out to deep point. Can't keep turning down singles forever"
19.3,"Natarajan to Gurkeerat, no run","looks to ramp, Natarajan fires one in full and quick. He gets an inside edge to short fine but turns down the single"
19.2,"Natarajan to Gurkeerat, no run","another big slower offcutter, and Mann is really early into the shot. Beaten again. Mustafizur-like cutters here"
19.1,"Natarajan to Siraj, 1 bye","slower offcutter, Siraj is beaten as he swings at it, and they steal the bye. Saha's throw bounces over the wicket"
18.6,"Holder to Siraj, 1 run","on pace, full, into the pads, a bit of a helicopter to long-on for one"
18.5,"Holder to Gurkeerat, 1 run","slower short ball, tries to hit it hard, but gets a single to deep midwicket"

18.3,"Holder to Gurkeerat, 1 run","in the slot but a slower ball, and he nearly holes out to deep cover. Just falls short of the man"
18.2,"Holder to Morris, OUT","full toss, Morris goes for the six over long-on, the bottom hand comes off, he gets no timing, and Warner takes the easy catch at long-on"
18.1,"Holder to Morris, 2 runs","nearly a yorker, Morris does well to drive this hard towards deep cover. it is dying on the sweeper, but Abhishek Sharma attacks the ball, and even though he doesn't get to it on the full, he makes sure he gets some part of his body behind it"
17.6,"Natarajan to Gurkeerat, no run","lovely yorker, well inside the wide line, squeezes under his bat"
17.5,"Natarajan to Gurkeerat, no run","wide yorker, ruled inside the wide line by the umpire. I thought it was slightly too wide, especially because Mann hadn't moved across"
17.4,"Natarajan to Gurkeerat, FOUR runs","nearly a sensational catch by Sharma. Mann looks to ramp this, Natarajan goes across him, he gets a top edge, and Sandeep chases this back from short third man. Somehow manages to get a hand to it but these are so difficult to take over your shoulder"
17.3,"Natarajan to Morris, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, outside off, punched to deep cover for one"
17.2,"Natarajan to Morris, no run","on a length, quick, flicked nicely, but straight to midwicket"
17.1,"Natarajan to Sundar, OUT","and he has taken that threat out. Slower ball, on a length, sundar early into it, hits it in the air back towards Natarajan, and he is lucky that it hits the wrist and deflects into his lap. These two have faced off against each other many a time in TNPL"
16.6,"Sandeep to Sundar, 1 run","full, nearly a yorker, dug out to deep point for one"
16.5,"Sandeep to Gurkeerat, 1 run",another yorker. Nails it. He cue-ends it for another single

16.3,"Sandeep to Gurkeerat, 1 run","slower ball, in the slot, and he flicks this is in the air towards long leg. Rashid, the fielder, has lost this in the lights, but goes back to make sure he prevents the boundary"

16.2,"Sandeep to Sundar, 1 wide","slower ball, full and wide, too wide"
16.1,"Sandeep to Gurkeerat, 1 run","yorker, on off, dug out for one to long-off"
15.6,"Rashid Khan to Sundar, no run","Pandey nearly takes a stunner. They go upstairs. The soft signal is not out. This is short of a length, and has been punched wide of extra cover, but Pandey dives full length to get a hand on it. He never is in control of the ball and grasses it. And his reaction suggested the same, but they still went upstairs. Not sure why we needed to do that"
15.5,"Rashid Khan to Sundar, FOUR runs","lovely shot. All hands and wrists to create the timing and power to clear extra cover. Just a touch too full, and he goes up and over extra"
15.4,"Rashid Khan to Sundar, no run","wrong'un, dipping, quick, takes the outside edge straight to pint, who is in tight on the single"
15.3,"Rashid Khan to Gurkeerat, 1 run","quick full legbreak, and Mann goes back to it. He is a sitting duck, but miraculously gets an outside edge to survive this ball"

15.1,"Rashid Khan to Sundar, 1 run","legbreak, sits up, punched uppishly down the ground"
14.6,"Holder to Sundar, 1 run","wide on the crease, pinpoint yorker on off. Dug out for a single. Good comeback after that first-ball four"

14.2,"Holder to Sundar, 1 run","short of a length, slower, straighter, and is run down to third man for one"
14.1,"Holder to Sundar, FOUR runs","gets the width and cashes in. Sundar is an intelligent player, and he deliberately cuts this short ball over point. Gets four for it"

13.5,"Natarajan to Sundar, 1 run","yorker, slides down, Sundar tickles this fine, but the fine leg is fine, which is where it should be when you are looking to bowl yorkers"

11.5,"Rashid Khan to Gurkeerat, no run","slow legbreak, really full, pushed to short cover"
11.4,"Rashid Khan to Philippe, OUT","now he will be happy. He has his man. Caught at deep midwicket. Short of a length, slow off the surface, and Philippe gets no timing on this pull at all"
11.3,"Rashid Khan to Philippe, no run","slower legbreak, just outside off, and he beats Philippe again. Oh he is not happy with those wides. You can see it from his face"
11.3,"Rashid Khan to Philippe, 5 wide","oh this one has done in even Saha. A wrong'un that starts on middle and leg, and beats Philippe comprehensively, but Saha has been blindsighted and can't catch up with it"
11.2,"Rashid Khan to Philippe, no run","another legbreak, this time on a length, and beats him outside off again"
11.1,"Rashid Khan to Philippe, no run","he makes room, Rashid bowls a wide legbreak. Beats him"
10.6,"Nadeem to AB, OUT","oh this looks like a bullet as it leaves his bat but de Villiers has found deep point with precision. Relief for Nadeem as de Villiers looked like he was going to reprise his KKR heroics after Nadeem dropped him earlier. This is on a length, just outside off, and de Villiers leans back to time the pants off it. Just can't place this wide of the man"
10.5,"Nadeem to Philippe, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to deep cover for one"
10.4,"Nadeem to AB, 1 run",punched down to wide long-off
10.3,"Nadeem to AB, 2 runs","stays short of a length, and de Villiers pulls in the air again. Straight of deep midwicket. Gets a couple"
10.2,"Nadeem to AB, SIX runs","that is a de Villiers special. A back-foot drive to a slow bowler and way way above long-on for six. As the phrase has gone around this year, Nadeem has been ABed this ball"

7.1,"Rashid Khan to Philippe, 1 run","wrong'un first up, Philippe picks it off the surface but does well to punch this down to wide long-on"
6.6,"Nadeem to AB, no run","he has out de Villiers down. Can you believe it? The match-up nearly works out as de Villiers punches this back at him and in the air. It is about knee high, and he has let it slip through. How much will this hurt SRH?"
6.5,"Nadeem to Philippe, 1 run","on a length, on off, turns away and sits up, punched uppishly down to long-off for one"
6.4,"Nadeem to Philippe, FOUR runs","manufactures this shot. This pitch will need some more of this manufacturing in the middle overs. Shuffles across, and deliberately lap-sweeps this in the air to clear short fine leg"

4.5,"Sandeep to AB, 1 run","outside edge first ball, but no slip in place. Another outswinger when a batsman is expecting an inswinger"
4.4,"Sandeep to Kohli, OUT","Sharma gets Kohli for the seventh time in the IPL. Again he follows inswinger after inswinger with an outswinger. On a length, outside off, slow off the surface, and Kohli fails to keep his drive down. Caught at short extra cover. Nobody has got Kohli out more often in the IPL. Sharma has gone past Nehra's six"
4.3,"Sandeep to Kohli, 2 runs","short of a length, wide, punched nicely through covers. Williamson's dive at extra cover gets a hand on it to save two runs"

3.3,"Holder to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length, Kohli looks to punch this through point but it is slow off the surface so he uses soft hands to drip this at his toes for one"

3.1,"Holder to Philippe, 1 wide","short of a length, looking to cramp him up, but slides too far down leg"
2.6,"Sandeep to Kohli, no run","short ball, gets it to rise higher than the chest. Kohli has to stand tall to make sure he fends it down"
2.5,"Sandeep to Padikkal, OUT","top of middle. On pace, swinging slightly, back in, but mostly wicket to wicket. Padikkal plays for the one swinging away from him and looks to loft him back over his head. This is cleverly bowled to make it swing back in. Beats him neck and crop"
2.4,"Sandeep to Philippe, 1 run","slower ball, full, driven down to long-on for one"
2.3,"Sandeep to Philippe, FOUR runs","short of a length, on-pace, pretty straight, he looks to pull this, but gets a front edge and manages to clear mid-off"
2.2,"Sandeep to Philippe, no run","knuckle ball, 114ks, and Philippe is well early into the shot. The lob back to him doesn't carry to Sharma"

1.6,"Holder to Padikkal, FOUR runs","first boundary of the innings. Holder stays short of a length, and angles this across him, but this Padikkal just punches it down the ground and straight of mid-off"
1.5,"Holder to Padikkal, no run","wide on the crease again, short of a length, angling away, punched straight to backward point"
1.4,"Holder to Padikkal, no run","this one has pace and carry. Short of a length, pitches outside leg, Padikkal makes room to look to off side, and the extra bounce beats him"
1.3,"Holder to Padikkal, no run","wide on the crease, short of a length, pulled to short midwicket. Gets no timing on this"
1.2,"Holder to Philippe, 1 run","short of a length, he moves across to access the leg side and punches this towards midwicket. Rashid puts in a dive there to keep them down to one"

0.4,"Sandeep to Padikkal, no run","fuller, swinging away from around off, beats his defensive push"
0.3,"Sandeep to Padikkal, no run","on a length, around off, opens the face on it. Can't get it past point. Early signs that the pitch is slow as they have time to play these length balls off the back foot"

0.1,"Sandeep to Philippe, no run","he moves across early as he is used to doing, and then leaves alone a wide inswinger"
14.2,"Nortje to Ishan, SIX runs","finishes it with a six! A sweet, sweet pick-up over square leg! That's a length ball into the stumps from around the wicket. Times that perfectly and the pace on that has sent it a long way back"

11.1,"Rabada to Ishan, SIX runs","lofted over sweeper cover. Length ball with a lot of width outside off. Just runs his hands through this, doesn't look to hit it hard. Uses the pace and clears the fielder"
10.6,"Nortje to Yadav, FOUR runs","jabs it over the keeper. Short ball in the corridor. Rises up with it, allows it to get past him and times it perfectly with the bat facing upwards"
10.5,"Nortje to Yadav, no run","short of a length in the corridor, too full for the pull. It trickles into midwicket"
10.4,"Nortje to Ishan, 1 run",short of a length and into the body. Tucked to midwicket's left
10.3,"Nortje to Yadav, 1 run","full and just outside off, punched to mid-on's right"
10.2,"Nortje to de Kock, OUT","defended onto the stumps. Thinks of a left-footed volley as the ball bounces, but he would have taken the stumps with it because the ball bobbed onto the bail. No room for the punch, no room for the kick. A length ball that he was looking to drop pitch side with soft hands"
10.1,"Nortje to de Kock, no run","good length wide outside off, punched on the rise to backward point"
9.6,"Dubey to Ishan, FOUR runs","and another. Tossed up outside off, walks into the line of that and sweeps along the floor between long-on and deep midwicket"

7.3,"Dubey to Ishan, no run","good length outside off, watchfully pushed to extra cover's left"
7.2,"Dubey to Ishan, no run","lbw is given and reviewed. This looks like a full toss that's struck him outside off on the boot. He was looking for the reverse sweep. On closer inspection, it's not hit him on the full. Bounces before hitting him low on the pad. But also looks a googly .so that is missing the wickets. Overturned"
7.1,"Dubey to Ishan, no run",stumping appeal as the googly rips past the outside edge. He was stepping down at this outside off. But has managed to stretch the back leg in

3.4,"Nortje to Ishan, FOUR runs",pulled to the wide long-on boundary. Good length and pushed across him. Quickly onto the back foot and an aerial pull. Nortje might have rolled the fingers on that too. It slides on nicely anyway

3.2,"Nortje to de Kock, FOUR runs","oh nice. He's played a few elite straight drives this tournament, and this one goes straight into the collection. A good length ball just outside off. Stays upright, offers the full face and check-punches between partner and stumps. High elbow and all"

18.1,"Boult to Ashwin, OUT",taken by long-on running to his left! Krunal Pandya. Full ball outside off. Gets deep in the crease and lofts it straight over the bowler. Krunal seems to have over-run it to his left but just manages to get his hands in order. Almost looks like he ran chest-first into a floating ball. Takes a tumble and keeps the balance

14.1,"Chahar to Hetmyer, no run","full googly at middle stump, defended down the pitch"
13.6,"Bumrah to Patel, OUT","pinned in front playing across the line. Harshal is not happy, but there are no reviews left. Shakes his head as he walks off. That's hit the back thigh and looks high. Short of a length on a middle stump line. Looks to play the flick and misses. Might have gone over the stumps, that. Replays confirm that"

13.4,"Bumrah to Patel, no run","bouncer at middle stump, ducks under it"

13.2,"Bumrah to Patel, FOUR runs","clipped to the midwicket boundary. Full and into the pads, shuffles and gets deep in the crease as he flicks aerially and wide of midwicket"
13.1,"Bumrah to Patel, no run","good length and into off stump, defended towards square leg off the inside edge"
12.6,"Chahar to Hetmyer, 2 runs","close run-out call at the striker's end. Good length ball at leg stump, tickled to short fine's left. Tiwary dives to his left and only manages to get a hand on that. QDK is standing in front of the stumps as a wide throw comes in. He tries to deflect it backwards and misses. Hetmyer was well out"
12.5,"Chahar to Hetmyer, no run","googly at a length on middle stump, defended off the front foot"
12.4,"Chahar to Hetmyer, 2 runs","short of a length just outside off, backs away and punches to sweeper's left"
12.3,"Chahar to Patel, 1 run","full outside off, leans in and drives to sweeper cover"
12.2,"Chahar to Hetmyer, 1 run","length at off stump, punched to long-off off the back foot"
12.1,"Chahar to Hetmyer, no run",good length and sliding away from the corridor. Thick outside edge to short third man as he gets forward to defend
11.6,"Bumrah to Patel, no run",past the outside edge again. Good length and into the corridor again. This time he defends inside the line on the front foot
11.5,"Bumrah to Patel, no run",past the outside edge. Good length ball angled into the corridor and straightening after landing on the seam. Harshal looks to defend for the initial angle
11.5,"Bumrah to Patel, 1 wide","bouncer dug in too short, ducks under it"
11.4,"Bumrah to Pant, OUT","big lbw appeal and it's given out. Sheepish smile as he discusses with Hetmyer before taking the review. Good length ball slides into him from around the wicket. He's beaten on the attempted flick. It's hit him on the outside of the knee flap, right in front of middle stump. It's a short stride. And it's out. Tracker shows that's hitting middle stump"
11.3,"Bumrah to Pant, FOUR runs","short and up at off stump, gets his weight onto the front foot and swipes this to deep square's right"
11.2,"Bumrah to Hetmyer, 1 run","short of a length and into leg stump, patted out to deep square"
11.1,"Bumrah to Stoinis, OUT","thick edge is taken! On the second attempt by QDK. It's coming apart rapidly for DC. Short of a length ball slanted into the corridor. Stoinis looks to force it through the covers off the back foot, but he's ended up playing inside the line. It pops out of QDK's grasp before he takes it"
10.6,"Chahar to Pant, FOUR runs","top edge clears short fine. Looks like a googly at middle stump, he gets low and goes full-blooded with the sweep. The batswing helps him out in the end"
10.5,"Chahar to Stoinis, 1 run","googly, short and into leg stump. Pulled out to deep midwicket"
10.4,"Chahar to Pant, 1 run","short of a length and sliding onto middle stump, mistimed pull to deep square's right"
10.3,"Chahar to Stoinis, 1 run",falls short of sweeper cover. Dipping legbreak outside off. Stoinis reaches with only his hands and looks to loft that over extra. Ends up slicing it
10.2,"Chahar to Iyer, OUT","stumping appeal as Iyer loses his shape and has his back leg in the air briefly. Good length ball rips away from him outside off as he goes across the line at this outside-off delivery. And his toe hasn't landed in time. QDK is quicker than Iyer. Lovely delivery from Chahar, a dipping legbreak outside off, but questionably shot selection from Iyer who was swishing all over that"
10.1,"Chahar to Pant, 1 run","length at the stumps, whipped to deep square"
9.6,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, no run","short and wide outside off, rapidly past his attempted cut shot"
9.5,"Coulter-Nile to Iyer, 2 runs","good length at middle stump, poked towards long-on"
9.4,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, 1 run","short of a length at middle stump, mistimed pull to deep backward square"
9.3,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, no run","slower length ball at middle stump, shapes for the reverse ramp and is beaten by the deception"
9.2,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, no run","dropped at midwicket. Pollard to his left. This short of a length middle stump ball was pulled very firmly off the front foot. Pollard got two hands to it though, about thigh height, and will be disappointed with that"
9.1,"Coulter-Nile to Pant, 2 runs","short of a length and into middle stump, pulled to deep square's right"
8.6,"Bumrah to Pant, 1 run","good length and into the pads, flicked to fine leg's right"
8.5,"Bumrah to Pant, no run","bouncer in the corridor, past him before he can get the hook away"
8.4,"Bumrah to Iyer, 1 run",short and climbing up at middle stump. That popped up and surprised Iyer. Took his bottom hand off and fended this pitch side on the off side
8.3,"Bumrah to Pant, 1 run",short of a length and into the corridor. Chopped towards the keeper off the under-edge
8.2,"Bumrah to Iyer, 1 run","good length at off stump, dropped into the off side with soft hands"
8.1,"Bumrah to Iyer, no run","good length and into off stump, defended to point"
7.6,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run","good length at off stump, punched to long-on"
7.5,"Yadav to Pant, 1 run","good length at off, steps out and punched to long-on"
7.4,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
7.3,"Yadav to Iyer, 2 runs",shuffles into the off side and ramps this past QDK's left glove. And just over the stumps too. It was a quick length ball outside off. Short third man cleans up to his left
7.2,"Yadav to Iyer, SIX runs",sends this a long way over long-on. The trademark Iyer loft against offspin. Quickly down the pitch to meet this at the pitch and a lovely clean swing with the turn
7.1,"Yadav to Pant, 1 run","full outside off, driven along the ground to long-off"
6.6,"Krunal to Pant, 1 run","yorker length on leg stump, driven to long-on"
6.5,"Krunal to Iyer, 1 run","good length on middle stump, punched to long-on"
6.4,"Krunal to Pant, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
6.3,"Krunal to Iyer, 1 run",good length and into the stumps. Backs away and looks to force that. Thick inside edge to long-on
6.2,"Krunal to Iyer, no run","good length and at middle stump, backs away and drives on the up to extra cover's left. Jayant Yadav stops with his outstretched left arm"
6.1,"Krunal to Iyer, 2 leg byes",length and sliding onto leg stump. Deflected towards short fine off the back foot as he looks to glance
5.6,"Yadav to Pant, no run","short of a length and just outside off, mistimed whip to midwicket off the back foot"
5.5,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run","good length on middle stump, punched to deep midwicket off the back foot"
5.4,"Yadav to Pant, 1 run",good length and sliding on towards off stump from around the wicket. Looks to drive and gets an inside edge to square leg
5.3,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run",short of a length and fired in at the stumps. Backs away and hurriedly cuts to cover's left
5.2,"Yadav to Iyer, no run",good length and pushed through quick outside off. Hurriedly jabbed towards short third
5.1,"Yadav to Iyer, no run","short of a length outside off, shuffles and glances to square leg"
4.6,"Boult to Pant, no run",good length and tucking him up at middle stump. Defended down the pitch
4.5,"Boult to Pant, no run","good length and just outside off, defended to cover off the front foot"
4.4,"Boult to Pant, no run","short of a length and wide outside off, cut to backward point"
4.3,"Boult to Iyer, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep backward square"
4.2,"Boult to Iyer, no run",good length and jumping up from a middle stump line. Gets behind that to defend and it pings off the outside half
4.1,"Boult to Iyer, no run",QDK the lone appealer for this catch behind. And he's managed to convince Pollard to review the not out decision. Short of a length and angled wide outside off. He checked himself on the cut. Ultra Edge has nothing. That's the review lost
3.6,"Yadav to Pant, no run","good length and into middle stump, gets forward and jabs to midwicket"
3.5,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, punched to long-on off the back foot"
3.4,"Yadav to Pant, 1 run","good length and sliding onto leg stump, nudged to deep square off the back foot"
3.3,"Yadav to Pant, no run","full and wide outside off, driven uppishly into the covers"
3.2,"Yadav to Iyer, 1 run","full on off stump, gets forward and flicks to long-on"
3.1,"Yadav to Iyer, no run","back of a length and turning into off stump, pushed down the pitch off the back foot"
2.6,"Boult to Shaw, OUT",sliced high for QDK and he takes it to his left. Short of a length ball rising at a leg stump line. He backs into the leg side and looks to swipe it with a horizontal bat. It's too steep and there's no room and all he manages is to slice this with the bat face pointed skywards
2.5,"Boult to Shaw, no run",ducks quickly as this bouncer heads for his helmet
2.4,"Boult to Shaw, FOUR runs","sliced over short third. Good length and across the corridor. Stays still and looks to slog this across the angle, loses his shape but has the runs"
2.3,"Boult to Shaw, no run","good length and into leg stump, flicked to midwicket"
2.2,"Boult to Shaw, no run","good length on middle stump, defended to mid-on"
2.1,"Boult to Shaw, FOUR runs",pulled to fine leg's left. Short and up at hips on a leg stump line. He's on his front foot and then he swivels to drag this away
1.6,"Krunal to Iyer, no run","good length on off stump, defended on the front foot"
1.6,"Krunal to Iyer, 1 wide","length and down leg side, beaten on the flick"
1.5,"Krunal to Iyer, FOUR runs","chipped over mid-off. Good length at off stump, marginal turn away. He reaches out and doesn't make the pitch of that, but he only wanted to get it over the infield and there's enough connection for that"
1.4,"Krunal to Shaw, 1 run",safely short of deep midwicket. This is dipping at a length outside off as he goes down for the sweep and sticks with that decision. Ends up hacking from under it with the bat face pointed upwards
1.3,"Krunal to Shaw, no run","full and into leg stump, poked to mid-on off the front foot"
1.2,"Krunal to Shaw, no run","short of a length and turning away outside off, cut to cover point"
1.1,"Krunal to Shaw, no run","good length and dipping outside off, pushed into the covers"
0.6,"Boult to Iyer, no run","good length at middle stump, leans in and tucks this to midwicket"
0.5,"Boult to Iyer, no run",good length and swung into leg stump. Flicked to square leg's right
0.4,"Boult to Iyer, no run","yorker and just outside off, jammed into the covers"
0.3,"Boult to S Dhawan, OUT","chopped straight to backward point! A sharp, low catch from, it looks like, Suryakumar. They've sent it upstairs with a soft signal out. A third man angle - the side angle in this case - shows he took the catch without the his hand touching the ground. That is, while the ball was still aerial. It's only in the follow through that his hand touches the turf, and from a front on angle, the umpire is satisfied that the back of the palm is under the ball. It's a second consecutive duck for Dhawan. This was a good length ball shaped away outside off, and he reached out for a square drive on the rise"
0.2,"Boult to S Dhawan, no run","good length and wide outside off, punched into the covers off the toe-end"
0.1,"Boult to Shaw, 1 run","full inswinger at off and middle stump, keeps his forward stride sufficiently leg side as he flicks to deep square"
17.4,"Jordan to Buttler, 1 wide",and Jordan ends it up with a wide outside off. Royals win with 15 balls to spare
17.3,"Jordan to Buttler, 2 runs","full and wide, crunched wide of deep cover to get the couple that levels the scores"
17.2,"Jordan to Buttler, SIX runs","Buttler is going to finish this off this over. Takes down fellow Englishman. Gets one in the slot, and clears the front leg to loft this over the sight screen"
17.1,"Jordan to Smith, 1 run","yorker, down leg, dug out to deep midwicket for one"
17.1,"Jordan to Smith, 1 wide","full, fast and wide. Too wide"
16.6,"Shami to Buttler, FOUR runs","end of an absolutely shocking over from Shami, whose comeback as a T20 bowler had so far been one of the stories of the tournament. Another slot ball, on-pace, and another four to deep midwicket"
16.5,"Shami to Smith, 1 run","and again, they nearly allow KXIP back in with a quick single. Hit straight to point, Buttler calls him through, and Smith is having to dive at the non-striker's end to stay alive. And he still wouldn't have got in had Suchith hit"
16.4,"Shami to Smith, FOUR runs",ah Smith. Quick half-volley are just what he needs. Gets down on a knee and ramps this over short fine
16.3,"Shami to Smith, 2 runs","slower ball, Smith makes room and drives this square of deep cover for two"
16.2,"Shami to Smith, FOUR runs","there is a deep midwicket in place, and Smith has decided to loft this slot ball in that zone. But he has managed to place this straight of that man"
16.1,"Shami to Smith, FOUR runs","half-volleys won't create magic. Smith lofts him over that man in the circle, the mid-off"
15.6,"Jordan to Buttler, SIX runs","Jordan goes back to bowling off-pace, and Buttler is prepared this time. The issue with this slower one is that is too full, and Buttler stays deep in his crease to loft this over long-on for six. Breaks the 11-ball boundary drought"
15.5,"Jordan to Buttler, no run","change of pace, bowls it quick, at 137ks, short of a length, and Buttler is hurried into the push. Jordan fields in his follow-through"
15.4,"Jordan to Buttler, no run","slower ball again, Buttler looks for the pull and it arrives late, taking the cue end through to the keeper"
15.3,"Jordan to Smith, 1 leg bye","another slower ball, on a length, Smith gets inside the line, and is hit on the pad. They take a leg-bye"
15.2,"Jordan to Buttler, 1 run","another slower ball, fuller, and driven straight to deep cover this thime"
15.1,"Jordan to Buttler, 2 runs","a typical dreamy Buttler punch. Slower length ball, and yet he times this back-foot cover-drive well enough for two, wide of deep cover"
14.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, no run","on a length, outside off, pushed to point, and this time they won't take Suchith on"
14.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Buttler, 1 run","quick length ball, middle and leg, worked to leg for one"
14.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Buttler, no run",massive but equally ridiculous lbw shout. And they will even review it. I have seen it all. This is a legbreak from round the wicket that has hit him in front. It has to pitch outside leg unless some physics is on leave. It isn't. A review wasted
14.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Buttler, no run","legbreak, just outside off, beats his punch"
14.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, OUT","direct hit. Oh why do they go for these silly runs when they can hit such big sixes? This is a quick length ball, Smith opens the face, straight to cover point. Samson hasn't hesitated, but he has still been beaten by the direct hit from Suchith, substituting for Mandeep"
14.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, 1 run","full and wide, driven down to long-on for one. Dragged all the way"
13.6,"Jordan to Smith, FOUR runs","misses the yorker, bowls a low full toss, and Smith jams down on it. He is opening the face on it, but he doesn't intend for it to go this fine. it hits the outer half of the bat, and does go fine of third man"
13.5,"Jordan to Samson, 1 run","Jordan lucky to get away with this. Short ball, down the leg side, with fine leg up. Samson pulls this down but straight to the man"
13.4,"Jordan to Samson, 2 runs","unbelievable shot. Jirdan hs dug this in, but Samson is off his feet, high in the air, and rides the bounce to cut this down into the ground. Arshdeep has to put in a big dive after chasing this from third man"
13.3,"Jordan to Samson, FOUR runs","on-pace, 143ks, too far down leg, and he gets a tickle on it. And the short fine is inside the circle. Oh the replay shows this has gone off the pad but the umpire has credited the runs to Samson"
13.2,"Jordan to Smith, 1 run","slower short ball, pulled down to long-on for one"
13.1,"Jordan to Smith, no run","slower ball, nearly a yorker, dug out back to him"
12.6,"Ashwin to Samson, FOUR runs","classy. Ashwin is not short here, but still short of a length. Samson delays his punch, and beats point to his right and deep cover to his left"
12.5,"Ashwin to Samson, SIX runs","just too short from Ashwin as he looks to bowl flat, and Samson pulls this over deep midwicket, the bigger boundary"
12.4,"Ashwin to Samson, no run","goes back to late-cut a flat delivery, but hits this straight to short third man"
12.3,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run","Arshdeep saves three. Smith backs away to punch, gets an outside edge fine of short third, but Arshdeep puts in the big dive to keep them down to one"
12.2,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","wrong'un, short of a length, punched down to long-on for one"
12.1,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run",down the wicket to push this length ball to long-on for one
11.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, no run","slow in the air, just short of Samson's arc, and he doesn't try to hit the six. Just pushes this back to him"
11.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, 1 run","flighted, on a length, punched down the ground for one"
11.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, no run","short of a length, outside off, punched down the ground, but Bishnoi fields this to his right to deny them the single"
11.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, no run","quicker, on a length, on off, defended back to him"
11.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, FOUR runs","Smith is not messing around here. Bishnoi tosses this up wide, and he sweeps this hard and down the ground. Wide of long-on it goes, and he didn't have far to go to his right, mind"
11.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, 2 runs","full, outside off, Smith plays the lap sweep, gets it fine of fine leg for two"
10.6,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run","full and straight, clipped off the toes for one"
10.5,"Ashwin to Uthappa, OUT","this is slower than the last ball, and gives him slightly less room to swing his arms. Uthappa still gets a lot of the slog-sweep, but not enough. Pooran takes the catch at deep midwicket. Just feet inside the fence"
10.4,"Ashwin to Uthappa, SIX runs","Uthappa gets into the act himself. Slog-sweeps him this time. Flat six over deep midwicket, the bigger boundary"
10.3,"Ashwin to Uthappa, no run",Uthappa looks for the big reverse hit to a length ball outside off. Is beaten. Rahul appeals for the catch but it is more hope than conviction
10.2,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","length ball, legbreak, punched to deep cover for one"
10.1,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","on a length, middle and leg, worked to leg for one"
9.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Uthappa, 1 run","flatter, wrong'un, Uthappa picks it and works it into the leg side for one"
9.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, 1 run","slow in the air, but not a half-volley. Samson is smart, and bunts this into the leg side for one"
9.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, no run","flatter, on a length, straighter, pushed back to his right, and Bishnoi is quick enough to deny them a single"
9.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, SIX runs",dreamy six. Bishnoi tossed it up twice in his last over but Samson chose to get his eye in. Not this time. Languidly he drives this over wide long-off for a six
9.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Uthappa, 1 run","really full, outside off, Uthappa nails the sweep, but gets just the single to deep backward square leg"
9.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Uthappa, no run","wrong'un, full, outside off, driven to extra cover"
9.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Uthappa, 1 wide",wide down the leg side. Uthappa will feel he has missed out on a boundary
8.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Samson, FOUR runs","nicely bowled but even more nicely played. This is a yorker outside off, but it is not express pace, which gives Samson the time to go back and open the face on it. He beats short third man with ease"
8.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Uthappa, 1 run","he is moving across early, Arshdeep stays on a length and wide outside off. Doesn't let him get inside the line. Just the single to leg"
8.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Samson, 1 run","yorker, dug out to long-on for one"
8.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Uthappa, 1 run","length ball, around off, and Uthappa moves across to get inside the line and flick this to deep backward square leg"
8.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Samson, 1 run","slower ball, really full, driven down to long-off for one"
8.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Samson, SIX runs","I mentioned the big boundaries in Abu Dhabi last over, but he says they are not big enough for him. Sees the short ball early, and it is just waist high. Pulls this way abover deep midwicket"
7.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Uthappa, FOUR runs",breaks the 11-ball boundary drought with a revere-sweep. Takes this from on the stumps and bisects point and short third man
7.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, 1 run","another brave flighted delivery, asking Samson if he wants to take on the big boundaries in Abu Dhabi. Just too full, and Samson knows he can't get under this one. Takes the single to long-on"
7.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Uthappa, 1 run","stays wide outside off with a length ball, and Uthapps sweeps it to deep square for one"
7.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, 1 run","flighted outside off, and that is a brave ball to Samson. Gets it wide outside his reach, though. Just the single to long-on"
7.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, no run","length ball, legbreak, gets some turn. Defended back to him"
7.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Uthappa, 1 run","low full toss, driven to long-on for one"
6.6,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","slower in the air, swept away from wide outside off for one. First boundaryless over"
6.5,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","length ball, legbreak, punched to deep cover for one"
6.4,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","full, middle and leg, clipped to deep midwicket"
6.3,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","full legbreak, driven along the ground to long-off for one"
6.2,"Ashwin to Samson, no run","wrong'un, short of a length, wide, and he has picked this only off the wicket. Dabs it to point"
6.1,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","middle and leg, full, clipped off the toes for one"
5.6,"Jordan to Samson, FOUR runs","oh lovely shot. Nonchalant. Short of a length, wide, and he punches this late to beat the man at point to his left and third man at the boundary to his right"
5.5,"Jordan to Uthappa, 1 run","slower ball as Uthappa moves across, and he nearly traps him leg-before. Uthapps gets the bat down in time"
5.4,"Jordan to Samson, 1 run","short of a length, wide, steered to third man for one"
5.3,"Jordan to Stokes, OUT","Stokes makes room to try to go over mid-off again, but Jordan is full so he gets too close to the ball. Doesn't get the elevation he wants. Finds mid-off. What relief for KXIP. What a fiery knock from Stokes to go with his bowling effort"
5.2,"Jordan to Stokes, no run","Stokes skips down the track, Jordan bowls the slower one, and he hits this to mid-on for a dot"
5.1,"Jordan to Stokes, SIX runs","what a rude and dismissive welcome to Jordan. Makes room and lofts this length ball over mid-off for his third six, brings up his fifty"
4.6,"Shami to Uthappa, no run","another teaser to mid-on. Uthappa looks to pull a skiddy short-of-a-length ball, and ends up half-volleying mid-on with the mis-hit"
4.5,"Shami to Stokes, 1 run","full toss again, hit to long-on for one"
4.4,"Shami to Stokes, no run","short of a length, angling in, cramps him up. Hit to cover-point"
4.3,"Shami to Stokes, no run","full toss outside off, he hits hard, gets a thick edge to short third man"
4.2,"Shami to Stokes, FOUR runs","Stokes is batting in another world. Incredible batting. Makes room, Shami goes for top of off, but he drives this on the up, and the ball singes the outfield as he rushes across through extra cover"
4.1,"Shami to Uthappa, 1 run","on a length, outside off, runs this down to third man for one"
3.6,"Ashwin to Stokes, no run","quick slider, beats his attempt at the reverse-sweep"
3.5,"Ashwin to Stokes, SIX runs",and Stokes goes midwicket this time. Deep into the crease to sweep this in the air. Nails it again
3.4,"Ashwin to Stokes, SIX runs","flighted delivery, the first time he has given it air, and it is a wrong'un, but Stokes knows the mid-on is up and he goes over that man. And gets six for it"
3.3,"Ashwin to Stokes, FOUR runs","nails the reverse-sweep this time. On a length, around leg, and he has absolutely smashed this over point"
3.2,"Ashwin to Stokes, no run","short of a length, slow, and Stokes makes room to cut, but straight to extra cover"
3.1,"Ashwin to Stokes, no run","looks to reverse-sweep first ball, is beaten and Ashwin appeals for leg-before. Pitched outside what would have been leg stump but does the batsman give up that right when he switches?"
2.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Stokes, 1 run","full and straight, nearly a yorker, flicked to long-on for one"
2.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Stokes, FOUR runs","Stokes makes room, Arshdeep follows him, and follows him too far. Stokes gets inside the line and flicks it straight of short fine leg"

2.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Stokes, 1 run","on a length, straight, pushed to mid-off for one"
2.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Stokes, FOUR runs","Stokes shuffles across early, and pulls this short-of-a-length ball from outside off and beats deep midwicket to his left"
2.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Stokes, no run","swinging low full toss, beats him outside off"
1.6,"Shami to Uthappa, SIX runs","short ball with fine leg up, and Uthappa gets inside the line of the ball to use his pace and pull him over fine leg for a big six"
1.5,"Shami to Stokes, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, no room, pushed wide of cover for one"
1.4,"Shami to Stokes, no run","Maxwell nearly pulls off a stunner. Sharp bouncer, gets big on Stokes, who ends up pulling this towards mid-on. He has to run in and dive, which he does, reaches it on a yorker length"
1.3,"Shami to Stokes, no run","looks for the ramp to a straight length ball, and gets the edge onto his own helmet grille"
1.2,"Shami to Stokes, FOUR runs","Stokes looks in golden touch. Short of a length, just outside off, and he luxuriously punches this in front of cover-point for four"
1.1,"Shami to Uthappa, 1 leg bye","short of a length, skiddy, beats his attempt to pull. Flies off the thigh pad for a leg-bye"
0.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Stokes, FOUR runs",Stokes negates the swing by jumping out of the crease and lofting this straight length ball over mid-on for the first boundary of the innings
0.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Stokes, no run","swinging again, and this time Stokes lets it alone outside off"
0.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Stokes, 2 runs",another thick outside edge as Stokes makes room to go big over cover. This swings a touch and goes over point for another couple
0.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Stokes, 2 runs",more swing as Stokes drives hard at this. The outside edge goes along the ground and wide of point for two
0.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Uthappa, 1 run","full, slight swing, pushed slightly wide of mid-on for one"
0.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Uthappa, no run","short of a length, pretty straight, defended back to him"
19.6,"Archer to Maxwell, no run","Maxwell will have to wait another night for his first six this IPL. Short, wide slower ball, beats him for a dot, and they don't even try to run a bye. Why, oh why?"
19.5,"Archer to Hooda, 1 run","full toss down leg, and he tries the cut shot behind square on the leg side but the fine leg deep. Only the single"
19.4,"Archer to Gayle, OUT","emotion from Gayle. He has missed out on a hundred. What a seed from Archer. Yorker on leg. Maybe just six inches short of one. It goes past the inside edge, hits the pad, and ricochets into the wicket. Gayle is looking to kick the ground with his bat but loses control and the bat flies towards midwicket. And then a nice tough. He forgets the bat, and shakes Archer's hand. Gayle walks back with the helmet on the top of his bat handle. The only man with two 99s in the IPL"
19.3,"Archer to Gayle, SIX runs","thigh-high full toss, hits him high on the bat, but Gayle has imparted a lot of power into this. Clears Stokes at wide long-on for six No. 1001"
19.2,"Archer to Maxwell, 1 run","dropped at short fine leg. Difficult chance, though. Maxwell gets inside the line tu try to flick it past short fine. Aaron dives to his left, gets a hand, but can't hold on"
19.1,"Archer to Gayle, 1 run","perfect yorker, also following him. Can't do much. Just the single"
18.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, 1 run",nearly takes out Maxwell at the non-striker's as he drills this low full toss outside off to long-off for one
18.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, SIX runs",ONE THOUSAND SIXES. Over the big leg-side boundary. To a quick bouncer that is higher than his shoulder. Enough said
18.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Maxwell, 1 run","leg-side full toss, and this should be on the grass banks, but Maxwell mis-hits it for a single to deep square leg"
18.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Maxwell, no run",Tyagi bowling smartly. Using his open stance to go wide outside off. Maxwell struggles to reach it again
18.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Maxwell, no run","and Tyagi comes back well, doing Maxwell in as he backs away early. He slips in a wide yorker outside off"
18.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Maxwell, (no ball) FOUR runs","that is a brutal delivery for Tyagi. Not only has he conceded four past short fine leg, he has also bowled a high full toss. No-ball"
18.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, 1 run","full and wide, nearly a yorker, driven to deep cover"
17.6,"Stokes to Pooran, OUT","Tewatia with another smart boundary catch. He has been so safe on the fens this year. Slower ball, short, around off, and Pooran takes on the short boundary. Tewatia leaps a little to take this overhead. Right at the edge of the boundary"
17.5,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 run","on-pace length ball, on off, and Gayle goes for it again. Ends up shanking it for a single to long-off"
17.4,"Stokes to Gayle, SIX runs","slower ball, on a length, looking to tuck him up, but Gayle can take on the shorter leg-side boundary with a six just over deep midwicket. No. 999 in T20s"
17.3,"Stokes to Pooran, 1 run","slower short ball, outside off, pulled to deep midwicket for one"
17.2,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 leg bye","slower ball, outside leg, Gayle early in his swing. Gets just the leg-bye"
17.2,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 wide","slower bouncer, called wide on height"
17.1,"Stokes to Gayle, FOUR runs","length ball, on-pace, asking for trouble. Gayle smashes this between long-on and deep midwicket for a four"
16.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Pooran, SIX runs","Tyagi errs a little in lenght, and Pooran is good enough and brutal enough punish him. Just misses his yorker by a foot or so, and he smacks him over long-off for his 25th six this IPL"
16.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Pooran, 2 runs","full toss, higher than the knee, Pooran is hurried into the shot, but still manages to hit it straight of long-on. Smith saves two with a dive there"
16.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, 1 run","shorter of being a yorker, and Gayle winds up, but doesn't get all of it. Just the single to long-off"
16.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Pooran, 1 run","another yorker, or a near-yorker at any rate. Pooran can get just a single into the covers"
16.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, 1 run","another yorker, just outside off, dug out for just the single"
16.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, no run","lovely yorker to start off, dug out back to him"
15.6,"Aaron to Pooran, SIX runs","and that one inch over the line has cost Aaron has seven runs. And this is an incredible shot. This is a slower ball, just short of a length, and wide outside off, but he has managed to loft this over extra cover for a six. That shot also makes Pooran the sixiest batsman this IPL, going past Samson's 23"
15.6,"Aaron to Pooran, (no ball)","short of a length, Pooran sets himself up for the six over square leg again, but the slower ball beats him. Oh hang on, this is a no-ball. Oh this might ruin what has been an excellent over"
15.5,"Aaron to Pooran, no run","slower ball, on a length, wicket to wicket, pushed to point for a dot"
15.4,"Aaron to Pooran, SIX runs","oh Pooran loves the pick-up shot. The first time Aaron has veered off the straight length ball. Just short of a length, and Pooran gets inside its line to pick it up over square leg for a six"
15.3,"Aaron to Gayle, 1 run","slower ball, 118ks, on a length, no room. Punched down to long-off for one. Good over so far"
15.2,"Aaron to Gayle, no run","quicker length ball, no room, and pushed back to Aaron"
15.1,"Aaron to Gayle, no run","slower ball, on a length, top of off, Gayle opens the face but sends this straight to point"
14.6,"Stokes to Pooran, no run","on a length, pretty straight, pushed back to him"
14.5,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 run","short of a length, on the pads, slower one, worked into the leg side for one. He called for two but it is not on"
14.5,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 wide",wide down the leg side
14.4,"Stokes to Rahul, OUT","Rahul has struggled to time the ball all night. It shows you the pitch is not easy. He rarely fails on the slog to a length ball. Bowled at 129ks, so seams like an on-pace ball because his slower ones have hovered around 110. Rahul doesn't get any power into the slow, and holes out to deep midwicket. Replays show this is the split-finger slower ball so he has really outfoxed Rahul"
14.3,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, 109ks, cramps him up, the mis-hit into the leg side gets them a single"
14.3,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 wide","quick bouncer, well outside off. Called wide. Not sure if it is on height or line"
14.2,"Stokes to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball, hit hard into the leg side, but doesn't make a clean connection. Gets just the single to deep midwicket"
14.1,"Stokes to Rahul, no run","slower ball, wide and full, but inside the line. Good ball. Left alone"
13.6,"Archer to Gayle, no run","sharp bouncer, just outside off, and Gayle wants to have nothing to do with this"
13.5,"Archer to Gayle, 2 runs","Gayle is haring between the wickets. He has hit the full toss to mid-off, and sets off immediately, and draws a misfield from Smith. And then runs the second off the misfield too. Scenes"
13.4,"Archer to Gayle, FOUR runs","full and sliding down leg, which is not what you want to do with fine leg up. Gayle clears the front leg to slog, but gets an inside edge past short fine leg for four"
13.3,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","cue-ends another shot to an on-pace delivery. The ball is not coming on. He looks to go wide of long-on, but gets the toe end for a single just past Archer to long-off"
13.2,"Archer to Rahul, FOUR runs","slower ball, 118ks, but he slides down leg, and Rahul picks the slower ball early to get inside its line and flick it past short fine leg"
13.1,"Archer to Rahul, no run","and Rahul is showing that intent. Makes room early to go over cover, but gets an inside edge to short fine. This pitch is not exactly a flattie"
12.6,"Tewatia to Rahul, 1 run","Rahul skips down the track, Tewatia pulls the length back, punched down to long-off for one"
12.5,"Tewatia to Gayle, 1 run","down the wicket to another wide length ball, gets a single to long-on"
12.4,"Tewatia to Gayle, SIX runs","just clears the leaping long-on. Six No. 20 for Gayle in just six matches this IPL. Wide length ball, Gayle thinks it is close enough to go for it, but toe ends it up for a skier. Teases and teases Stokes before going over his head"
12.3,"Tewatia to Rahul, 1 run","he is beginning to show intent. Shuffles across early, sweeps this down, gets a single to deep square leg"
12.2,"Tewatia to Gayle, 1 run","full, outside off, Gayle uses his feet and gets too close to the ball. Gets just the single to long-on"
12.1,"Tewatia to Gayle, no run",oh sees a length-ball legbreak and goes for the slog-sweep. Beaten by the turn
11.6,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 run","short ball, crunched hard off the pull, but gets just the single to deep midwicket"
11.5,"Stokes to Rahul, 1 run","full and wide, driven hard, but straight to sweeper-cover"
11.4,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, cue-ended to long-off for one"
11.3,"Stokes to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover for one"
11.2,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 run","short ball, gets big on him, and the pull goes towards long-on instead of midwicket, which is what he intends"
11.1,"Stokes to Rahul, 1 run","on a length, on off, pushed wide of Stokes to long-off"
10.6,"Tewatia to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, punched down to long-on"
10.5,"Tewatia to Gayle, 1 run","Tewatia has nearly done him in all by himself. Gayle tries to go straight down the ground, but toe-ends a skier. This has gone nowhere. Is landing at around the 30-yard circle. Tewatia charges back at it, and Stokes, running in, lets him go for it. He puts in a dive, but can't reach it"
10.4,"Tewatia to Gayle, no run","short of a length, wide, away from the hitting arc. Hit straight to extra cover"
10.3,"Tewatia to Gayle, SIX runs","big boundary, what big boundary? This is the first mistake Tewatia has made. Gives him the slogging length, and he goes flat and over wide long-on. Third fifty in six matches"
10.2,"Tewatia to Rahul, 1 run","full again, and again too full to go aerial. Driven to deep cover for one"
10.1,"Tewatia to Gayle, 1 run","full, outside off, just too full for the slog. Drilled down to long-off for one"
9.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Rahul, no run","short ball well outside off, but Rahul tries to pull it. He is beaten by the slowness of the surface"
9.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, 1 run","yorker, middle and leg, Gayle shows the respect and digs it out for one"
9.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, no run","full and straight, 140ks, defended back to Tyagi"
9.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Rahul, 1 run","wide length ball, runs off the outside half of the bat for a single to third man"
9.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Rahul, SIX runs","lovely shot. Length ball, outside off, and he stands tall and drives this on the up and in the air over extra cover. This is the short boundary too. So with Gayle in the side, Rahul is okay taking risks in the middle overs too"
9.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Rahul, no run","wide on the crease, full, into the pads, driven straight to short midwicket"
8.6,"Tewatia to Gayle, no run","slow, short of a length, wide, and it squeezes under his bat. Excellent first over for Tewatia"
8.5,"Tewatia to Gayle, no run","short of a length, wide, cut straight to a fielder in the infield"
8.4,"Tewatia to Rahul, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to deep cover for one"
8.3,"Tewatia to Gayle, 1 run","again, stays short of a length and wide outside off. Cut to deep cover for one"
8.2,"Tewatia to Gayle, no run","another slider, short of that slogging length. Left alone outside off"
8.1,"Tewatia to Gayle, no run","slider, short of a length, wide outside off, cut straight to point"
7.6,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 run","slower ball again, short of a length, outside off, punched down to long-off for one"
7.5,"Stokes to Gayle, no run","another knuckle ball, 113ks, really full outside off, takes the bottom edge into the pitch and through to Samson"
7.4,"Stokes to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball, full, middle and leg, driven to long-on for one"
7.3,"Stokes to Gayle, 1 run","short, quick, pulled to deep midwicket for one"
7.2,"Stokes to Gayle, FOUR runs","slower ball, offcutter, does him in, takes the outside edge, but it is well wide of the diving Samson. Sorry it is not an offcutter, but a knuckle ball"
7.1,"Stokes to Rahul, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, clipped away for one"
6.6,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","half-volley, outside off, driven to deep cover for one"
6.5,"Gopal to Gayle, 1 run","shorter, flatter, pulled down to long-on for one"
6.4,"Gopal to Gayle, SIX runs","never mind the slip. Gayle has slogged this over the bigger boundary. He sees one full enough, the back knee goes down, and he slogs powerfully. The knee doesn't even reach the ground as he plays the shot"
6.3,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","short ball, slow off the surface, pulled straight to deep midwicket"
6.2,"Gopal to Gayle, 1 run","fuller, straighter, worked to leg for one"
6.1,"Gopal to Gayle, no run","wrong'un first up. Seems like he has picked it off the surface, but has enough time to adjust and play a defensive shot"
5.6,"Aaron to Rahul, FOUR runs","not the cleanest of the shots. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a 53-for-1-in-PP pitch. Rahul is repeatedly getting done in by the slow nature of the surface. Gets a thick inside edge as he looks to go over the infield, but luckily it goes straight of midwicket in the circle"
5.5,"Aaron to Rahul, no run","on a length, on top of off, defended back to him"
5.4,"Aaron to Rahul, 2 runs","full and straight, clipped away off the toes, in front of deep square leg"
5.3,"Aaron to Rahul, no run","slower ball, nearly a yorker, dug out to mid-off"
5.2,"Aaron to Rahul, SIX runs","and now Rahul is well and truly in the party, hats and all. Massive pull to a short ball that is only about rib high. Huge strike over square leg"
5.1,"Aaron to Rahul, 2 runs","and now Rahul looks to joins the party. It is a length ball, within Rahul's swing, and he looks to go over wide mid-on. But again he hits it off the inside half of the bat. Early into the shot. Signs that this is not the easiest pitch to bat on"
4.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, no run","nearly a yorker again, on middle and leg, this time it is dug out to mid-on"
4.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, no run","bouncer, on leg, gets it high, and Gayle ducks under it. And suddenly the follow-through is longer"
4.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, FOUR runs","Gayle moves early. Tyagi thinks he has bowled a decent yorker. Just short of a yorker, but by no means a half-volley. On off. So Gayle has to dig it out, but he digs it out with such power and with that tree turn in his hands. It rolls all the way to the extra-cover fence"
4.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, SIX runs","short of a length, middle and off, and he clears his front leg to pull him over deep midwicket. Gayle has had his sighter. Now RR need his wicket soon or they will get no sighter come second innings"
4.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, FOUR runs","again, a length ball just outside off, and he has driven this flat and in the air, and well above mid-off who just throws his head back"
4.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Gayle, no run","wide length ball, beats him on the drive. Gayle has made his intentions clear, though"
3.6,"Aaron to Rahul, no run","short of a length, no room, defended"
3.5,"Aaron to Gayle, 1 run","length ball, middle and leg, worked to deep forward square leg for one"
3.4,"Aaron to Gayle, 2 runs","this is a Mars-kisser (and it is visible clearly on this full-moon night). Gayle looks to pull again, and gets a massive top edge towards deep backward square leg. Parag runs to his left, and Uthappa runs back from inside the circle. Parag calls for it, and is perhaps put off by another fielder in his sight, and drops him"
3.3,"Aaron to Gayle, SIX runs","oh, a risky shot from Gayle. Chest-high short ball, tucks him up with the line, and Gayle still pulls it despite a man at deep forward square leg. Not a big six, and beats Riyan Parag to his left"
3.3,"Aaron to Gayle, 1 wide",wide down the leg side again. Aaron is looking to deny him any room and erring down the leg side
3.2,"Aaron to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, steered down to third man for one"
3.1,"Aaron to Rahul, no run","full, outside off, Rahul looks to drive, but it hits the inside half of the bat. So this pitch is not a flat batting beauty"
2.6,"Archer to Gayle, no run","bouncer, but Gayle smartly drops his wrists out of the way and lets it sail through to Samson"
2.5,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","on a length, outside off, runs off the high part of the bat to third man for one"
2.4,"Archer to Rahul, no run","short of a length, no room, Rahul opens the face, but can't find a gap"
2.3,"Archer to Rahul, no run","on a length, just outside off, defended"
2.2,"Archer to Rahul, FOUR runs","it is Archer, yes, but you can't block his quota out. Rahul sees this just short of a length, but crucially he has the width. He throws his bat at it, and cuts it over the leaping point. That is 600 runs for him this IPL"
2.1,"Archer to Rahul, no run","on a length, on top of off, defended back to him"
1.6,"Aaron to Gayle, FOUR runs","down the wicket, Aaron shortens the length, Gayle pulls, and he gets a bottom edge past the wicketkeeper for four"
1.6,"Aaron to Gayle, 1 wide","short of a length, wide down the leg side"
1.6,"Aaron to Gayle, 1 wide","bouncer, too high, Samson has to leap full length to prevent byes. Called wide"
1.5,"Aaron to Gayle, no run","Gayle gives him the charge, turns this into a length ball, but can't beat short midwicket"
1.4,"Aaron to Gayle, no run",seam movement. Stays short of a length and pretty tight on the line. It leaves him after pitching and beats the outside edge as Gayle pushes in defence
1.3,"Aaron to Gayle, no run","short of a length, middle and off, punched with an open face to cover-point"
1.2,"Aaron to Gayle, no run","short of a length, angling away just outside off. Left alone"
1.1,"Aaron to Gayle, no run","short of a length, down the leg side, kisses the pad on the way through. Samson has to put in a dive to prevent leg-byes"
1.1,"Aaron to Rahul, 2 wide",big wide down the leg side. Samson gets a hand to it but they will get a bye too
0.6,"Archer to Mandeep, OUT","sensational bowling and an equally sensational catch. We have said it so many times about Stokes. This is Test-match stuff. Bouncer, straight at his badge. And his eyes look away as he throws his bat up in self defence. The ball lobs up towards point but it looks like it will fall short, but Stokes charges in and puts in a full-length dive to catch it"
0.5,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, on top off, dropped wide of cover for one"
0.4,"Archer to Rahul, no run","on a length, slightly wider, driven on the up, but straight to cover-point"
0.3,"Archer to Rahul, no run","short of a length, at him, rib-high. Defended back to him"
0.2,"Archer to Rahul, no run",nice little push-drive to a full ball outside off. Sent straight to short cover
0.1,"Archer to Rahul, no run","starts off with a yorker, 139ks, dug out off the inside edge"
19.6,"Nagarkoti, to Jadeja, SIX runs","pulled over wide long-on! Jadeja points to the dugout, then turns around and underlines his name  on the jersey. And then holds a finger up. He's scored 29 off the 30 they needed in the last two overs. It's another length ball across the corridor, and it's another pull. Flat and safely wide of the fielder in the deep"
19.5,"Nagarkoti, to Jadeja, SIX runs",pumps it over deep midwcket! The length ball gets figured out eventually! Jadeja the new finisher for CSK. Lines it up at off stump and swings across the line to make sweet contact on that
19.4,"Nagarkoti, to Jadeja, no run",beaten on the slash. It's four length balls across the corridor so far and CSK have not found a way. Jadeja backs into the leg side and looks to cut but that is under the bat
19.3,"Nagarkoti, to Sam Curran, 1 run","good length and pushed wide across him again. Seems a plan and he's stuck to it so far. Curran looks to hammer it through the off side, gets an under-edge to extra cover"
19.2,"Nagarkoti, to Sam Curran, 2 runs",good length and pushed across him. Front leg into the leg side and slapped on the up to long-off's right
19.1,"Nagarkoti, to Sam Curran, no run",mistimed slog back to the bowler. Short of a length and just outside off. His pull is back to the bowler on the bounce
18.6,"Ferguson to Jadeja, FOUR runs","outside edge to third man. Oh boy, the wheels have come off for Lockie, who has been so good for them before this match. Good length ball pushed across the corridor. Gets the front leg away and has a big hoick at that. Third man is in but he wouldn't have had a chance if he was back"
18.5,"Ferguson to Jadeja, SIX runs","swiped over deep square! Doesn't dare go to the yorker after the slip-up last ball, and it has costed him big. This is a length ball on leg stump. Jadeja stays tall and swipes under that. It's all there - the pace, the line, the length. His job was to make contact. And he did. Ferguson pulls his shirt up and sinks his face into it"
18.5,"Ferguson to Jadeja, (no ball) 2 runs",a full toss above waist. Mistimed pull to deep square's right but that is three bonus runs
18.4,"Ferguson to Jadeja, FOUR runs",dragged to the fine leg boundary. A full toss on the pads. Stands tall and gets it fine of the short fine fielder
18.3,"Ferguson to Sam Curran, 1 run","yorker at a middle stump line, 146kph. Backs away and chops it to sweeper cover"
18.2,"Ferguson to Sam Curran, no run","beaten on the attempted ramp. Low full toss in the corridor. He predicted the length alright, but the line doesn't allow him to get bat on that because it's headed straight for him as he shuffles"
18.1,"Ferguson to Jadeja, 1 run","low full toss at leg stump, 145kph, whipped along the ground to deep midwicket who steams in and keeps them to one. Nagarkoti the fielder, buying himself more room for the 20th over"
18.1,"Ferguson to Jadeja, 1 wide","yorker down leg side to start off, left alone"
17.6,"Cummins to Jadeja, 1 run","yorker just outside off, front leg in the leg side and in the air. Balance entirely on his back foot. Can only stab it down to long-off"
17.5,"Cummins to Sam Curran, 1 run","full and just outside off, clears the front leg and drills it to long-off's left"
17.4,"Cummins to Jadeja, 1 run","full and just outside off, forced down to long-on off the front foot"
17.3,"Cummins to Jadeja, no run",short of a length and across off stump. Beaten on the attempted late cut
17.2,"Cummins to Gaikwad, OUT","splits middle and off stump! It's a length ball angled into the stumps. He drops his right shoulder and gets low to try and ramp this over short fine, but that has slid onto the stumps from under the bat. Shakes his head as he walks off"
17.1,"Cummins to Sam Curran, 1 run",can't get the run-out at the non-striker's end. It's a yorker outside off. Curran wants to ramp over short fine. Gets it pitch side on the leg side and is nowhere near completing the run. Cummins can't quite find the balance as he picks up and turns to throw
16.6,"Ferguson to Sam Curran, 1 run",inside edge on a good yorker. At leg stump. Curran backs away and has a hack at that. Out to short fine's right
16.5,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, 1 run","full and wide outside off, reaches out and drives to long-off"
16.5,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, 1 wide","good length and very wide outside off, left alone"
16.4,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, FOUR runs",manages to get the sweep away this time. This guy sees differently. Gets down on a knee and drags a Lockie Ferguson length ball over square leg from outside off
16.3,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, 2 runs",nice timing on this but straight to sweeper cover. They steal a second from him. Short of a length outside off and a nice flow on the cover drive
16.2,"Ferguson to Sam Curran, 1 run","yorker at middle stump, flicks it into his pad and gets only a single in the covers"
16.1,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, 1 run","full and wide outside off, and he looks to sweep him. Thick inside edge only as far as square leg"
15.6,"Narine to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","beats deep midwicket's slide. Short of a length slower ball, steps out and pulls between long-on, Rinku, and deep midwicket, Cummins. They're converging on that and Cummins almost pulls out of the slide at the end"
15.5,"Narine to Gaikwad, 1 run","good length on leg stump, leans in and flicks to long-on"
15.4,"Narine to Sam Curran, 1 run","short of a length and turning away outside off, dragged out to long-on with a pull"
15.3,"Narine to Sam Curran, no run","good length and turning away outside off, punched into the covers off the back foot"
15.2,"Narine to Gaikwad, 1 run",short and turning into off stump. Punched to sweeper cover
15.1,"Narine to Gaikwad, no run","good length and just outside off, steps out and pokes into the covers"
14.6,"Varun to Sam Curran, no run","dropped! Oh he's going to think about this all evening if they don't pull it off tonight. A simple catch put down by the bowler in his follow through. Short of a length outside off. Curran runs down the pitch and isn't close to the pitch of that. Looks to punch towards long-off and it comes off the high part of the bat and floats at a comfortably pace and height to Varun's right. He gets both hands on it, but perhaps the hands were too hard"
14.5,"Varun to Sam Curran, no run","good length and just outside off, guided into the covers off the front foot"
14.4,"Varun to Dhoni, OUT","takes out leg stump! Oh he's burst through MS Dhoni's defences after softening him up the last two balls. Proper dominance, those last three balls. This is quick, and it's sliding into Dhoni who is hurriedly skipping into the leg side to try and make room and stab this through square leg off the back foot. Plays all over it and the stump is well and truly tonked. Bowled by Varun C for the second time this season"
14.3,"Varun to Dhoni, no run","short of a length and turning into middle stump. Cramped on the back foot punch, gets it to extra cover"
14.2,"Varun to Dhoni, no run","good length at off stump, stabbed to extra cover off the front foot"
14.1,"Varun to Gaikwad, 1 run","short and wide outside off, mistimed cut into the covers"
13.6,"Cummins to Gaikwad, 1 run","short and just outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
13.5,"Cummins to Dhoni, 1 run","good length and just outside off, opens the face and runs it down to third man"
13.4,"Cummins to Rayudu, OUT",can't beat mid-off this time. Short and wide from Cummins this time. He runs down the pitch and wants to flat-bat it over the infield. But it's gotten too steep for control and it's about throat height for the fielder there
13.3,"Cummins to Rayudu, FOUR runs","shuffles and swipes it fine. Expert limited-overs batting. He's played pretty much the only two boundary shots you can get off Cummins' length balls outside off. It's angled in, he uses that to get it fine"
13.2,"Cummins to Rayudu, FOUR runs","rolls into the long-off boundary. Mid-off is in. He steps out in anticipation of Cummins' good length ball slammed into the pitch and gets it. Outside off, he's running into the leg side. It comes off the low part of the bat and floats over the infield"
13.1,"Cummins to Gaikwad, 1 run",good length and in at the stumps. Steps out to try and drive on the rise through cover. Gets a thick inside edge down to long-on
12.6,"Varun to Rayudu, 2 runs","googly at a length on middle stump, steps out and is beaten in flight. Manages to jab it into the vacant leg side off the inside edge"
12.5,"Varun to Rayudu, no run",good length and into the corridor. Under-edge into the pitch on the late cut
12.4,"Varun to Gaikwad, 1 run","googly at a length just outside off, punched to deep extra cover"
12.3,"Varun to Rayudu, 1 run",good length and sliding into the corridor. Opens the face and runs it to point
12.2,"Varun to Gaikwad, 1 run",good length and pushed through quickly outside off. Leans in and drives to sweeper's right
12.1,"Varun to Gaikwad, FOUR runs","cut over extra cover. Drops this legbreak short outside off, he's backing into the leg side as he whips out at it. Lockie slides to his right, studs up like a red-card tackle. Can't stop that"
11.6,"Nagarkoti, to Gaikwad, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, pushed into the covers"
11.5,"Nagarkoti, to Rayudu, 1 run","short outside off, shuffles and pulls to deep midwicket"
11.4,"Nagarkoti, to Rayudu, SIX runs","upper cut over the cover boundary. You read that right. Some hit, this. Short and wide outside off and sitting up for him. He reaches out and sends it well in front of square"
11.3,"Nagarkoti, to Gaikwad, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to sweeper cover on the rise"
11.2,"Nagarkoti, to Gaikwad, 2 runs","short of a length outside off, waits on that and cuts to sweeper's left to bring up his second consecutive fifty"
11.1,"Nagarkoti, to Rayudu, 1 run","good length outside off, steps out and looks to crash it through the covers. Gets a thick inside edge to fine leg"
10.6,"Ferguson to Rayudu, 1 run",good length and into leg stump. Forced to midwicket's right off the back foot
10.5,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, 1 run","good length outside off, leans into the drive to long-off"
10.4,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, SIX runs",pumps it over the long leg boundary! Slower short ball down leg side. Waits on that and pulls from under it. Sends it onto the second tier
10.3,"Ferguson to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length outside off, jabbed into the covers"
10.2,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, 1 run","short of a length on off stump, dropped into the off side with soft hands"
10.1,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, FOUR runs",more elegance from Gaikwad. Not many batsmen have taken a liking to Lockie so far. Gaikwad enjoying him so far. This is full and just outside off. Sliding into the corridor and he's stood tall and opened the wrists to loft that over extra cover
9.6,"Rana to Gaikwad, 1 run","full and fast outside off, drilled down to long-off on the front foot"
9.5,"Rana to Rayudu, 1 run","slower, at a length outside off. Poked into the covers"
9.5,"Rana to Rayudu, 1 wide","full and fired down leg side, left alone"
9.4,"Rana to Rayudu, FOUR runs","full and wide again, and he lifts it over extra cover like the throwdown it is"
9.3,"Rana to Rayudu, FOUR runs","lofts it straight! This is fairly simple batting for Rayudu, who is very good against spin. There's dew, Rana doesn't give it too may revs. So he knows it's safe to run down at him without the fear of getting beaten. Doesn't get to the pitch of this length ball but manages to launch it anyway"
9.2,"Rana to Rayudu, FOUR runs",whack. Full and wide and sliding on nicely outside off and Rayudu reaches out and drills that over extra cover
9.1,"Rana to Gaikwad, 1 run",short and skiddy at middle stump. Hurried pull to deep midwicket
8.6,"Narine to Gaikwad, 1 run","good length outside off, leans in and punches to long-off on the front foot"

7.6,"Varun to Rayudu, 1 run","good length and just outside off, opens the face and runs to short third"
7.5,"Varun to Rayudu, no run",inside edge onto pad as this googly heads for middle stump from outside off
7.4,"Varun to Gaikwad, 1 run",good length and sliding onto off stump. Punched to long-off on the up
7.3,"Varun to Watson, OUT",taken at long-on. A tame slog sweep attempte. A hit out attempt. Wasn't picking him at all. A length ball outside off that grips and goes away from the attempted slog sweep. Sends it high up and it's taken well inside
7.2,"Varun to Watson, no run",beaten on the punch. Good length ball delivered with a legcutter grip. Most times that comes in. That's what Watson thinks on this occasion.But this grips and goes away
7.1,"Varun to Gaikwad, 1 run","length at middle stump, punched to midwicket"
6.6,"Narine to Gaikwad, 1 run","offbreak tossed up at a length outside off, punched to long-off on the front foot"

6.2,"Narine to Gaikwad, 1 run","good length on middle stump, flicked with the turn to deep midwicket"

5.5,"Varun to Gaikwad, 1 run","short of a length at leg stump, whipped to long-on off the back foot"
5.4,"Varun to Gaikwad, no run","good length at the stumps, looks to force off the front foot and gets an inside edge onto pad"
5.3,"Varun to Gaikwad, SIX runs","punched over the long-off boundary off the back foot! Or a back foot position, anyway. That is outrageous. Technically, he's running down at that, but he's static as he forces this short of a length ball. Straight bat but down to up, a punch upwards and it's gone a fair distance too. Incredible"
5.2,"Varun to Gaikwad, no run",short of a length and following him down leg as he backs away to try and drive over the infield. Beaten
5.1,"Varun to Gaikwad, no run","short of a length indipper outside off, cut to backward point"
4.6,"Ferguson to Watson, no run","slower short ball just outside off, forced to adjust to try and pull that. Beaten on the under-edge"
4.5,"Ferguson to Watson, no run",hooked to short fine on the bounce. Short one up at the ribs and it looks like he gets that off the glove. 151.2kph ball
4.4,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, 1 run","good length on middle stump, pushed out to mid-on"
4.3,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, FOUR runs","gorgeous lofted drive over the bowler. Full and into off stump, stays very still and offers the full face to get this over the bowler. Minimum effort"
4.2,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, no run","full slower ball wide outside off, steps out and into the leg side to make room for himself. Is forced to chuck his hands at that and get it off the under-edge"
4.1,"Ferguson to Gaikwad, FOUR runs","pulled to deep square's left and just enough to beat Nagarkoti. Short ball up at middle stump, pulls off the front foot and high into the leg side. Bounces despairingly to Nagarkoti's left and his attempted scoop back in isn't successful"
3.6,"Narine to Gaikwad, 1 run","good length at leg stump, lofted drive out to long-on"
3.5,"Narine to Watson, 1 run",good length curveball away from off stump. Punched to long-on off the back foot
3.4,"Narine to Gaikwad, 1 run",good length and floating away towards off stump. Punched to long-on off the front foot
3.3,"Narine to Gaikwad, no run",short and turning into off stump. Backs away and finds cover point with the cut
3.2,"Narine to Watson, 1 run",short and turning away outside off. Waits on that a long time before dragging a check-pull out to deep midwicket
3.1,"Narine to Gaikwad, 1 run",good length and curving away outside off. Punched to midwicket's left off the back foot
2.6,"Cummins to Watson, FOUR runs",pulled to deep square's left. A slower ball dug in short and coming into his body. He's quickly in position to get behind that and swivels to get it over the boundary on the bounce
2.5,"Cummins to Watson, no run",good length and angled into the stumps. Flicked to midwicket
2.4,"Cummins to Gaikwad, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, flicked to midwicket's right"
2.4,"Cummins to Gaikwad, 5 wide",short ball climbs over DK. Dug in very very short. Gaikwad was running down the pitch and couldn't even think of getting connection on that. That gripped in the surface
2.3,"Cummins to Gaikwad, no run",short of a length and slower in the corridor. Opens the face and steers to short third
2.2,"Cummins to Gaikwad, FOUR runs","good length ball slanted into him, he backs away and punches it on the up to get it wide of mid-off"
2.1,"Cummins to Gaikwad, no run","good length and into off stump, defended into the covers"
1.6,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, no run","short of a length and just outside off, punched to mid-off off the back foot"
1.5,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, no run","good length at leg stump, pushed out to midwicket's left"
1.4,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, SIX runs",doesn't stay low this time and he uses the bounce to lift this over the long leg boundary. Short and into middle and off. Swivels and nails the pick up
1.3,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, no run",short and keeps low as it straightens outside off. Left alone
1.2,"Nagarkoti, to Gaikwad, 1 run","full and swung away outside off, reaches out and slices to third man"

0.1,"Cummins to Watson, no run","good length at middle stump, defended to mid-on from the crease"
19.6,"Ngidi to Tripathi, 2 runs","just short of deep midwicket and they pinch the second. Full slower ball at middle stump, gets down for the slog sweep and gets too far under it. Ends up lofting it high as Jadeja swoops in on it"
19.5,"Ngidi to Karthik, 1 leg bye",full slower ball follows him down leg side. He gets on a knee for the sweep but cops that on the front pad
19.4,"Ngidi to Tripathi, 1 run","yorker at off stump, steers the jab straight to backward point"
19.3,"Ngidi to Karthik, 1 run","yorker on leg stump, flicked to deep square's left"
19.2,"Ngidi to Morgan, OUT",taken at long-off. Full slower ball wide outside off. Walks into the off side this time and is still forced to reach out. Wants to loft over extra cover but gets it only a couple of yards to long-off's right
19.1,"Ngidi to Morgan, FOUR runs","edged over third man. Backs into the leg side and is forced to stretch out to try and get a connection on this full one outside off. Gets his reward for reaching it in the end, I suppose"
18.6,"Sam Curran to Karthik, 2 runs","full outside off, looks to drive through the off side and gets a thick inside edge to long-on's right"
18.5,"Sam Curran to Karthik, no run",beaten on the drive. Goes a long long way into the leg side and misses out on an overpitched ball outside off
18.4,"Sam Curran to Karthik, 2 runs","slower short ball just outside off, cut aerially to sweeper's right"
18.3,"Sam Curran to Karthik, FOUR runs","walks into the off side and swats it over square leg. No one back on the line square on the leg side. This is a cutter, short and wide outside off from over the wicket. So the angle is well against him, but he's moved right across and found his spot"
18.2,"Sam Curran to Morgan, 1 run","short of a length and rising outside off, cut uppishly to sweeper cover"
18.1,"Sam Curran to Morgan, FOUR runs","slapped over extra cover. That is savvy, not an easy shot on a slow surface. Cutter climbing up at an off and middle stump line. His feet are off the floor and he's cramped as he gets into the leg side, but he manages to get the punch away"
17.6,"Ngidi to Karthik, FOUR runs",just short of fine leg who ends up creating a ramp for the ball to slide off of and lob into the boundary behind him. Slower short ball at middle stump and it was a dipping pull shot to Jagadeesan's left. Decided to go in for the catch and couldn't manage it
17.5,"Ngidi to Karthik, 2 runs","slower ball at a length on middle stump, flicked to long-on's right"
17.4,"Ngidi to Karthik, FOUR runs",lifted over the keeper. Slower ball at a length on middle stump. Gets on a knee and steps into the off side. Shapes for the paddle sweep and then adjusts to use the extra bounce to go upwards and get it over Dhoni
17.3,"Ngidi to Karthik, 2 runs","slower ball at a length on middle stump, leans and in and clips it to short fine's left"
17.2,"Ngidi to Morgan, 1 run","yorker wide outside off, chopped to deep point"
17.1,"Ngidi to Rana, OUT",slammed high up and taken at long-on. Full offcutter at off stump. Rana looks for the slog and is done by the pace. Gets a nice connection on it but it's all elevation. And it looks like that swerves on Curran late in its path because he's taken it a couple of inches out to his right and at waist height. These guys train to take catches as close to the body as possible so that must have changed path. Good take to end a good innings
17.1,"Ngidi to Rana, 1 wide","slower ball at a length, wide outside off. Left alone"
16.6,"Chahar to Rana, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"

16.4,"Chahar to Rana, 1 run","yorker and just outside off, jabbed to backward point"
16.3,"Chahar to Rana, FOUR runs","lifted over extra cover. Full and just outside off, half a stride but out of the way of the ball to make room. Goes inside-out from right under his eyes"
16.2,"Chahar to Rana, no run","slower ball at a length on leg stump, backs away and looks for the chop through cover. Misses as it lobs over the stumps"
16.1,"Chahar to Rana, FOUR runs","short slower ball at leg stump. He runs down on it and swipes it to deep square's left off his hips. Rayudu pulls it back in with a slide to his left. But in his recovery, as the ball slides towards the boundary, he gives it a pat with his foot in contact with the padding"
15.6,"Karn to Morgan, no run","good length on off stump, defended down the pitch"
15.5,"Karn to Rana, 1 run","good length on off stump, jabs it into the covers with soft hands"
15.4,"Karn to Rana, no run","beaten. Googly, full and wide outside off. Looks to go over cover and can't connect"
15.3,"Karn to Rana, SIX runs",drilled straight! Karn is rattled. Looks like this quicker one is pushed through from the front of the hand. It's overpitched and outside off and it's the perfect pace as he drives straight and through the line
15.2,"Karn to Rana, SIX runs","steps out and drags it over square leg! Good length and dipping on him as he steps out. He counts on it to spin into his body and it does, and his wholehearted slog makes connection"
15.1,"Karn to Rana, SIX runs",front leg out of the way for the slog sweep. Good length and at a middle stump line. Down on one knee and that slides on nicely as he swings from underneath
14.6,"Jadeja to Morgan, 2 runs","good length on leg stump, clipped to deep square's right off the front foot"
14.5,"Jadeja to Rana, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
14.4,"Jadeja to Rana, no run","good length and pushed past the tramline outside off, left alone"
14.3,"Jadeja to Rana, no run","inside edge on the reverse sweep. Full and down leg side, too far away for him to make optimal connection"
14.2,"Jadeja to Rana, FOUR runs",dragged to deep square's right. Full and just outside off. Gets down on a knee and lofts this to find the gap
14.1,"Jadeja to Rana, 2 runs","good length outside off, leans in and nudges to long-on's left with soft hands"
13.6,"Karn to Rana, 1 run",falls safely in front of long-on. Googly at a length. Steps out and can't get to the pitch of that. Ends up slicing his attempted slog and Curran can't get close in the end as this plonks just past the circle
13.5,"Karn to Morgan, 1 run","good length on middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
13.4,"Karn to Morgan, no run","googly spins away from leg stump, Morgan shapes to close the face but ends up defending into the off side"
13.3,"Karn to Morgan, no run","good length and just outside off, punched back down the pitch"
13.2,"Karn to Rana, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket to bring up his fifty"
13.1,"Karn to Morgan, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
12.6,"Jadeja to Rana, no run","short of a length and just outside off, cut to backward point's right"
12.5,"Jadeja to Singh, OUT",top edge out to deep square. Good length ball gets big on him as he checks himself on the attempted sweep. Floats out gently for Rayudu
12.4,"Jadeja to Singh, FOUR runs","b>spanked to long-off's right. That's a good looking drive. Good length and sliding on quickly outside off, goes through the line and on the rise"
12.3,"Jadeja to Rana, 1 run","good length on leg stump, pulled to deep backward square"
12.2,"Jadeja to Singh, 1 run","good length at leg stump, miscued slog to deep midwicket"

11.6,"Karn to Singh, no run","good length and just outside off, opens the face and pushes to extra cover"
11.5,"Karn to Rana, 1 run",short and gripping outside off. Gets big on him as he cuts uppishly to sweeper cover
11.4,"Karn to Singh, 1 run","on the bounce to long-on. Full one at middle stump, a lofted drive with little elevation"
11.3,"Karn to Singh, no run","good length and just outside off, pushed to extra cover off the front foot"
11.2,"Karn to Rana, 1 run","full on leg stump, mistimed slog to deep square"
11.1,"Karn to Singh, 1 run","good length at middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
10.6,"Santner to Rana, FOUR runs","swept to deep square's left. Full and down leg side. Sweep is aerial for a bit, but dipping quickly to Rayudu's left. Too quickly away from him as he dives"
10.5,"Santner to Rana, FOUR runs","whipped to long-on's left. Good length ball at middle stump, steps out to the pitch of that and slugs it forcefully with the turn"
10.4,"Santner to Singh, 1 run","good length and spinning into off stump, lunges out and gets an inside edge onto pad that deflects so short third's right"
10.3,"Santner to Rana, 1 run","short of a length outside off, cut to point's left. Ngidi dives to the left to parry that for sweeper cover"
10.2,"Santner to Singh, 1 run","flighted full toss outside off, forced down to long-off with the cut"
10.1,"Santner to Rana, 1 run","full and outside off, leans in and flicks to long-on with the turn"
9.6,"Ngidi to Rana, 1 run","slower short ball just outside off, steers it down to third man"
9.5,"Ngidi to Rana, no run","short and into the body. Jumps into the leg side to try and cut, but that's past him quickly"
9.4,"Ngidi to Rana, FOUR runs",caressed past point. Looks like a slower ball. Short and just outside off. Waits on it and rolls the wrists over that late cut to get it to point's right
9.3,"Ngidi to Rana, no run",beaten on the pull. Short ball seams away wide outside off and he can't manage to drag that into the leg side
9.2,"Ngidi to Singh, 1 run","good length outside off, punched on the rise to sweeper cover"
9.1,"Ngidi to Rana, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut on the bounce to sweeper cover"

8.4,"Santner to Rana, 1 run","good length on leg stump, punched towards deep midwicket off the back foot"
8.3,"Santner to Narine, OUT",taken at deep midwicket. Tosses this up slowly at a middle and leg line. He's hitting into the longer side. And he can't clear the fielder with the slog. Floats nicely out to Jadeja who takes it inisde the line
8.2,"Santner to Narine, no run","full on middle stump, drilled firmly back to the bowler off the front foot"
8.1,"Santner to Narine, no run","short and sliding rapidly away from off stump, beaten on the cut"
7.6,"Karn to Narine, 1 run",length ball and dipping at leg stump. Heaved out to deep backward square

7.4,"Karn to Narine, no run","full on the pads, looks for the slog and cops that on the front leg"
7.3,"Karn to Narine, no run","just past his grasp. Good length at off stump, looks for the flick and closes the face too early. Karn flies to his right in the follow through and can't get to that"
7.2,"Karn to Gill, OUT","knocks out leg stump and belts out a victory cry! Gill pretty static in his stance outside leg stump. Looks like he was trying to open up the off side. It's a slider on a good length, and he swishes for the initial line as it beats the inside edge"
7.1,"Karn to Rana, 1 run","good length and onto leg stump, steps out and jabs it into the midwicket region"
6.6,"Jadeja to Rana, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, backs away and cuts to sweeper cover"
6.5,"Jadeja to Rana, no run","good length and across the corridor, opens the face and gets this to short third"

4.5,"Ngidi to Rana, no run",beaten on the late cut. Short ball is quickly past him in the corridor

3.2,"Sam Curran to Gill, 1 run","good length and into middle stump, pushed towards mid-on with the angle"
3.1,"Sam Curran to Gill, FOUR runs",punched past cover. Length ball in at leg stump. He goes a long way down leg side to make room and taps this on the rise to get it between cover and extra

0.5,"Chahar to Rana, no run","full inswinger at leg stump, looks to flick and gets an inside edge onto front pad"
0.4,"Chahar to Rana, FOUR runs",thick outside edge past short third man. Short of a length outswinger outside off. Feet rooted as he looks to punch away from the body. It bounces to Ngidi's left
0.3,"Chahar to Gill, 1 run","good length and swung away outside off, thick outside edge to third man as he pushes on the front foot"
0.2,"Chahar to Gill, FOUR runs","inside edge to fine leg. Short of a length and curving away outside off, looks to punch through cover with an angled bat and gets lucky"
0.1,"Chahar to Gill, FOUR runs","swinging away, short and wide outside off. Sits on the front foot and flat-bats this past short extra cover"
19.1,"Siraj to Yadav, FOUR runs","Yadav provides an exclamation mark on this performance with a delightful drive over extra cover to finish it all off. And then he looks at someone (I don't know whom) and gestures, ""Am I all right?"". You are more than all right sir. You are more than fine. You are exceptional"
18.6,"Morris to Pollard, FOUR runs","ends up giving him a full toss, and Pollard won't be leaving this, no sireebob. Flicks it through forward square leg for four. That is the game"
18.5,"Morris to Pandya, OUT","slower ball, on a length, Pandya is looking to go over extra. And it seems to me he has picked the slower ball, but ends up hitting it straight to extra cover. There is a send-off. RCB have been feisty all night, but this one doesn't involve their captain Kohli. Morris has had something to say to Pandya, who points a finger and says something in return"
18.4,"Morris to Pandya, SIX runs","that is why Pandya doesn't need to push for twos. He gets one in his slot, on middle and leg, and dismisses it over wide long-on for six. Disdainful"
18.3,"Morris to Yadav, 1 run",gets down on a knee to sweep this full toss to deep fine leg. Not sure why has gone for this option with the fine leg back
18.2,"Morris to Yadav, 2 runs","makes room to try to go over extra cover. The length ball sort of stops at him, and the toe end clears extra cover for a couple"
18.1,"Morris to Yadav, no run","full, on off, with mid-off and extra cover up. Yadav has to get only six feet to the left, but drives this straight to extra cover"
17.6,"Steyn to Pandya, no run",Pandya gets the full toss within his range that he is looking for but ends up swinging inside its line
17.5,"Steyn to Yadav, 1 run",he is looking for the ramp again but Steyn bowls wide and short. He manages to pull this to deep midwicket for one
17.4,"Steyn to Yadav, SIX runs","full toss. Straight. Yadav says thank you very much. Gets on a knee, and uses all of his 143ks pace to guide it over fine leg for six"
17.3,"Steyn to Pandya, 1 run","full and wide, goes off the toe end fine of the deep point. But they don't push for the two"
17.3,"Steyn to Pandya, 1 wide",another wide full toss. He will need a ladder to get there
17.3,"Steyn to Pandya, 1 wide","full and wide, too wide. Pandya is standing his ground"
17.2,"Steyn to Pandya, no run","perfect wide yorker, squeezes under his bat"
17.2,"Steyn to Pandya, 1 wide",that is short and wide. And this time it is called despite Pandya's move across
17.1,"Steyn to Pandya, no run","wide length ball, not called wide because the umpire has decided Pandya moved across. But this is still too wide"
16.6,"Morris to Yadav, FOUR runs",Yadav gets the boundary they needed this over. Morris is frustrated but he has bowled length with no deep midwicket. He flicks this over the man in the circle
16.5,"Morris to Pandya, 1 run",shuffles across to punch this length ball to leg. Just the single to deep midwicket
16.4,"Morris to Yadav, 1 run","full and straight, driven straight of long-on, but they are not pushing for two"
16.3,"Morris to Pandya, 1 run",but Morris keeps hunting those pads. Punched down to long-on for one. Good over so far
16.2,"Morris to Pandya, no run","on a length, quick, on off. Pushed back to him"
16.1,"Morris to Yadav, 1 run","quick offcutter, does him in, but he gets an inside edge for a single to deep square leg"
15.6,"Siraj to Yadav, 1 run","full toss, on off, driven to deep cover for one"
15.5,"Siraj to Yadav, no run","yorker, dug out. Pandya not wasting his energy taking quick singles"
15.4,"Siraj to Yadav, FOUR runs","more touch from Yadav. Siraj bowls a bouncer, Yadav arches back, creates a bit of a room and ramps this over the keeper's head"
15.3,"Siraj to Yadav, no run","on a length, just outside off, pushed back to him"
15.2,"Siraj to Yadav, FOUR runs","full, outside off, with mid-off inside the circle. You must have a death wish. Yadav here chooses to kill with paper cuts. A teasing push-drive to torture both mid-off and cover as it goes to the fence"
15.1,"Siraj to Yadav, FOUR runs","feeding them now. On a length, into the pads, and he gets inside the line to flick it to the left of the diving long leg. That is an excellent fifty for Yadav"
14.6,"Morris to Pandya, no run","slower short ball, widish. Pandya decides late to abort the shot"
14.5,"Morris to Pandya, 2 runs","moves across early, Morris slips in a yorker, but the bat comes down in time. They take two as this goes wide of midwicket, but doesn't race to the boundary riders"
14.4,"Morris to Pandya, SIX runs","length ball, on the pads, dismissed it over the deep square leg. Just a flick of the wrists. Doesn't even look up to see if he has done enough to clear the big Abu Dhabi boundaries"
14.4,"Morris to Pandya, 1 wide",wide down the leg side. Pandya will feel he has missed out
14.3,"Morris to Pandya, no run","short of a length, outside off, pushed to point with an open face"
14.2,"Morris to Pandya, no run","slower ball, full, nearly a yorker. Dug out back to him"
14.1,"Morris to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length, straight, punched to long-on"
13.6,"Chahal to Pandya, no run","quick, middle and leg, turning towards off. Defended solidly"
13.5,"Chahal to Krunal, OUT","Chahal gets another batsman with a wide slow legbreak. Unlike Yadav, Krunal Pandya looks to clear long-off. This doesn't turn back, and takes the toe end for a catch to long-off"
13.4,"Chahal to Yadav, 1 run","length-ball, legbreak, from middle and leg, punched down to long-on for one"
13.3,"Chahal to Yadav, FOUR runs","full, fast, down the leg side, and he loves this for the sweep. Gets this fine of long leg, using his pace"
13.2,"Chahal to Krunal, 1 run",swept to long leg for one
13.1,"Chahal to Krunal, 2 runs",punched over midwicket for two
12.6,"Steyn to Yadav, no run","slower ball, short of a length, toe-ended to cover"
12.5,"Steyn to Yadav, FOUR runs","short, wide, this is not good from Steyn. This time he plays the back-foot drive, in front of deep cover. Such good timing. All along the ground"
12.4,"Steyn to Yadav, no run","slower ball, on a length, just outside off. Defended to cover"
12.3,"Steyn to Yadav, FOUR runs","short, wide, ordinary, and Yadav stands tall to cut down on the top of the bounce. Beats point. Third man has no chance either"
12.2,"Steyn to Yadav, FOUR runs","short of a length, too wide, and Yadav looks to cut. He is late into it, but the width also means the outside edge goes fine for four"
12.1,"Steyn to Krunal, 1 leg bye","short of a length, too quick for him. A leg-bye to square leg"
11.6,"Chahal to Yadav, SIX runs","top shot over the bigger boundary. Chahal has done this to many a big hitter. Just bowl a slow loopy wide legbreak, and they go wild and mis-hit it. Yadav plays the classic drive over extra cover, using the turn. And goes all the way too"
11.5,"Chahal to Yadav, no run","quicker length ball, Yadav draws the late-cut, but can't beat short third man"
11.4,"Chahal to Krunal, 1 run","down the wicket, Chahal stays slow, so he drives this down the ground and along the ground"
11.3,"Chahal to Krunal, 2 runs","reverse-sweep again, and he connects it well. The lack of pace means it goes square as opposed to behind square. Gets two"
11.2,"Chahal to Krunal, FOUR runs","strong wrists to clear cover. He has picked the spot, which is over extra cover, but he is cramped for room, and unfurls the wrists to get the required power to clear the man in the ring"
11.1,"Chahal to Krunal, no run","Pandya looks to reverse-sweep Chahal, who slows it down, and beats him with a legbreak"
10.6,"Siraj to Krunal, 1 leg bye","short of a length, at the hip, goes for one leg-bye"
10.5,"Siraj to Krunal, no run","bouncer, quick, at his face, and he sways out of its line"
10.4,"Siraj to Tiwary, OUT","sensational catch at mid-off. Padikkal uses all his height to dive full-length and forward to send him back. Tiwary is looking for something pitched slightly full to go over mid-off, but this is bowled cross-seam and stops on him. It is dying on Padikkal, but he flies forward to take this inches from the ground. One of the best catches of the season for sure"
10.3,"Siraj to Tiwary, 2 runs","wide length ball, pushed to the left of square third man. Gets two"
10.2,"Siraj to Tiwary, no run","short of a length, pretty straight, stays low, keeps this out, and doesn't get a single"
10.1,"Siraj to Tiwary, no run","on a length, on-pace, 134ks, on top of off. Pushed with an open face to point"
9.6,"Chahal to Yadav, no run","the teasing wide slow legbreak. Many a batsman has fallen for it, but he delays the shot and drives this square. Can't beat point, though"
9.5,"Chahal to Yadav, no run","quick length ball, defended back to him"
9.4,"Chahal to Yadav, FOUR runs","scud missile of a sweep. This is really full, and he has absolutely bludgeoned this sweep dead square on the leg side"
9.3,"Chahal to Yadav, SIX runs","top-edges the big slog sweep, and there is a man stationed at deep midwicket. This is the shorter boundary - not very short, mind - and it clears the man. Only just"
9.2,"Chahal to Tiwary, 1 run","full, on off, driven down to long-off for one"
9.1,"Chahal to Yadav, 1 run","accurate legbreak, turns less than expected, runs off the inside half of the bat for one"
8.6,"Sundar to Yadav, 1 run","full, middle and leg, driven to long-on for another single"
8.5,"Sundar to Tiwary, 1 run",might have been wide down leg had Tiwary not worked this to long leg
8.4,"Sundar to Tiwary, no run","slower in the air, some turn, hits the outer half of the bat as he looks to push this to leg"
8.3,"Sundar to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length, straight, punched down to long-on for one"
8.2,"Sundar to Tiwary, 1 run","on a length, on off, driven to long-off for one"
8.1,"Sundar to Yadav, 1 run","offbreak, gets some turn, the ball runs off the inside half of the bat for one"
7.6,"Chahal to Yadav, 1 run","slider, into the pads, looking to protect the over. Just the single to leg"
7.5,"Chahal to Ishan, OUT","Chahal does it again. Slows it down, tempts the batsman, and he skips down to try to go for a straight six. The ball drift away a little, and is also slow in the air, and he gets only the toe end on this. Ends up skying it"
7.4,"Chahal to Yadav, 1 run","looks for the sweep from outside off, but this is a slow legbreak and does him in. He gets a single off the cue end. To long-on. On the sweep"
7.3,"Chahal to Ishan, 1 run","sweeps this from around leg, gets a single to deep square leg"
7.2,"Chahal to Yadav, 1 run","slow, short of a length, cut straight to deep cover for one"
7.1,"Chahal to Yadav, no run","wrong'un first up?. Fullish, around off, hits the inside half of the bat as he pushes at it"
6.6,"Sundar to Yadav, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, punched to deep midwicket for one"
6.5,"Sundar to Yadav, no run","slightly fuller, slightly straighter, defended back to him"
6.4,"Sundar to Yadav, no run","quick, on a length, punched to short cover"
6.3,"Sundar to Ishan, 1 run","cut in the air, just wide of point and just short too. They get a single off a misfield"
6.2,"Sundar to Ishan, no run","on a length, opens the face, Yadav wants one but is sent back. Rightly so. Because the short third man is in tight for the single"
6.2,"Sundar to Ishan, 1 wide",wide down the leg side. Kishan looks for the bye off the fumble but is sent back. Rightly so
6.1,"Sundar to Yadav, 1 run","on a length, middle and leg, punched to long-on for one"
5.6,"Siraj to Ishan, FOUR runs","all wrists. This is on a length, and on the pads, and he has flicked this between mid-on and midwicket. Slightly fuller than good length in fact"
5.5,"Siraj to Yadav, 3 runs","lovely shot. Shot of a man among the runs. Short of a length, outside off, and he still punches this wide of mid-on for three"
5.4,"Siraj to Yadav, no run","short of a length, outside off, punched to mid-on"
5.4,"Siraj to Yadav, 1 wide","looks to bounce him, slides down the leg side"
5.3,"Siraj to de Kock, OUT","de Kock looks to repeat the shot he played to Steyn last over. The pull to a length ball, but Siraj doesn't offer him the high pace he got from Steyn. Ends up toe-ending it to the deep midwicket. Siraj can do no wrong these days"
5.2,"Siraj to de Kock, no run","full, just outside off, driven hard into the pitch, straight of mid-off. De Kock says no to the single"
5.1,"Siraj to Ishan, 1 run","nearly played on. Short of a length, straight, he looks to open the face, but gets an inside edge onto the toe. They take the single too"
4.6,"Sundar to de Kock, no run","full and straight, 103ks, pushed back to him"
4.5,"Sundar to de Kock, 2 runs","slog again but Sundar is not giving them the ideal length to slog. Keeps this down now, and hits it in front of deep square leg for one"
4.4,"Sundar to de Kock, 2 runs","backs away - I think he wants to go over cover - but Sundar follows him and he ends up slogging. Off the inside half of the bat it goes, in the air, but between midwicket and mid-on"
4.3,"Sundar to de Kock, no run","quicker, flatter, straighter, pushed to cover"
4.2,"Sundar to de Kock, no run","slower through the air, and de Kock has to abort this big swing. Pushes this to point"
4.1,"Sundar to Ishan, 1 run","on a length, quick, into the body, pushed towards mid-on for one"
3.6,"Steyn to de Kock, SIX runs","de Kock is so good at the pull. This is a length ball, I am not kidding. Bu he stays back and swivels with the pull to clear the bigger boundary here. Steyn's pace also helps"
3.5,"Steyn to de Kock, no run","short, 139ks, de Kock wants to pull this hard, but it doesn't quite come on, and takes the front edge to mid-on"
3.4,"Steyn to de Kock, no run","de Kock looks to back away, Steyn follows him with a quick delivery, hitting his glove"
3.3,"Steyn to de Kock, 2 runs","slower ball, on a length, and even though Steyn has drawn a mis-hit from de Kock, he has done enough to clear mid-on with this swipe"
3.2,"Steyn to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, pushed towards midwicket for one"
3.1,"Steyn to de Kock, 1 run","really full outside off, driven wide of mid-off for one"
2.6,"Sundar to Ishan, FOUR runs","finally misses his length. Probably bowls it quicker to protect a good over, and ends up bowling it short. Kishan goes back to cash in, cutting it to the right of point"
2.5,"Sundar to de Kock, 1 run","on a length, into the body, pushed to mid-on for one"
2.4,"Sundar to Ishan, 1 run","looks for the big drive down the ground, the angle takes the thick inside edge for one"
2.3,"Sundar to Ishan, no run","slower in the air, but doesn't budge from that in-between length. Defended back to his right"
2.2,"Sundar to Ishan, no run","short of a length, stays low, punched to midwicket"
2.1,"Sundar to Ishan, no run","on a length, angling in, no room. Pushed back to him"
1.6,"Steyn to de Kock, 2 runs","slower ball, full outside off, drives this past short cover. Deep point has to run to his left to field this"
1.5,"Steyn to Ishan, 1 run","skiddy short ball, hurries him into the pull, but he gets bat on it for a single to square leg"
1.4,"Steyn to Ishan, SIX runs","what a way to go to 1000 IPL runs. On a length, middle and leg, and he plays the pick-up over midwicket. That's why Sten struggles in T20s. Not enough movement on the ball in this format"
1.3,"Steyn to Ishan, no run","uppish towards mid-off. Looks like a front-of-the-hand slower ball, and Kishan is early into the push to a length ball"
1.2,"Steyn to de Kock, 1 run","on a length, middle and leg, shaping away towards off. Runs this square on the off side for one"
1.1,"Steyn to de Kock, no run","half-volley, looking for swing, and de Kock drives this powerfully. But straight to mid-off"
0.6,"Morris to Ishan, no run","on a length, straight, slight shape, defended to mid-off"
0.5,"Morris to Ishan, FOUR runs","short, wide, and Kishan is quick to cut this hard and in front of point. Short in stature, he loves the cut"
0.4,"Morris to Ishan, no run","misses out on a freebie. Full ball down leg, needs just a tickle, but what it tickles is the protruding thigh pad and nearly trickles back onto the wicket"
0.3,"Morris to de Kock, 1 run","short of a length, at his hip, pulled down and in front of square for one"
0.2,"Morris to de Kock, no run","short of a length, slight seam back, hits him on the thigh pad"
0.1,"Morris to de Kock, no run","on a length, outside off, pushed towards point. Sent back rightly by Kishan"
19.6,"Boult to Gurkeerat, 2 runs","shuffles across to go behind square on the leg side, but gets a front edge towards deep midwicket for two"
19.5,"Boult to Gurkeerat, FOUR runs","slower full ball, right in the slot, and mid-off is up. Mann goes deep into the crease to loft this over mid-off"
19.4,"Boult to Gurkeerat, FOUR runs","he likes it when the pace drops off from the Bumrah levels. Bould bowls full and straight, and he whips this square of deep midwicket"
19.3,"Boult to Gurkeerat, no run","slower offcutter, wide outside off, but can't be a wide as he has moved across. Mann wants the wide but is sent back. de Kock hits the stumps but he is back in. Lucky it hasn't ricocheted"
19.2,"Boult to Sundar, 1 run","on-pace length ball with mid-off up. Recipe for disaster. Sundar, though, hits this straight to the man placed wide than an usual mid-off"
19.1,"Boult to Sundar, 2 runs","misses the yorker a little, and mid-off is up. But Sundar can't drive this wide enough of that man. They do run the second off the fumble, though"
18.6,"Bumrah to Sundar, 1 run","searing yorker. Swinging in late, headed for the base of leg stump, but Sundar's bat somehow comes down in time"
18.5,"Bumrah to Gurkeerat, 1 run",quick and straight to Mann. He is late into the slog again. Just mis-hits this to mid-off for one
18.4,"Bumrah to Sundar, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, pushed wide of cover for one"
18.3,"Bumrah to Gurkeerat, 1 run","follows him with a length ball, slogged to deep square for one"
18.3,"Bumrah to Gurkeerat, 1 wide",that seems to be about the only way RCB can score off Bumrah. A bouncer well down the leg side. Called wide
18.2,"Bumrah to Gurkeerat, no run",looks to slog at a length ball but again Bumrah is too quick for him. All he manages is a limp hit to short midwicket. Falls just short
18.1,"Bumrah to Gurkeerat, no run","short of a length, quick, on top of the stumps. Pushed back to him"
17.6,"Boult to Sundar, FOUR runs","that wide has cost them more than just that extra. Boult is looking to tuck these batsmen up, but ends up sliding down leg again. And Sundar glances this fine of long leg for four"
17.6,"Boult to Sundar, 1 wide","bouncer, it is a good ball, but only just down leg. I wouldn't have called it a wide, but the umpire does"
17.5,"Boult to Gurkeerat, 1 run","short, into the body, hurries him into a pull. Just the single to deep square leg"
17.4,"Boult to Sundar, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, swivel-pull to long leg for one"
17.3,"Boult to Gurkeerat, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, runs this down to third man for one"
17.2,"Boult to Morris, OUT","short and quick, chest-high, Morris is off his toes to try to cut this down, but it gets big on him, and the top edge flies to third man. This wicket might be worth 10 runs in the end"
17.1,"Boult to Morris, FOUR runs","Morris continues with his cameo-hitting form. There has hardly been any runs scored in the last two overs, and three wickets have fallen, but he makes room and casually thumps this length ball in front of deep cover for four"
16.6,"Bumrah to Gurkeerat, no run","double-wicket maiden. Slower ball, on a length outside off, and he ends up pushing inside its line"
16.5,"Bumrah to Padikkal, OUT","are we in for a double-wicket maiden? Padikkal has been placing these perfectly all night but has found the man at long leg now. Short of a length, into the body, uses his wrists to punch this in the air, but straight to Boult"
16.4,"Bumrah to Padikkal, no run","just short of the diving man at point. This is short of a length, he looks to which this to leg, but gets an inside edge onto the thigh pad. Ishan Kishan puts in a full-length dive at point, but this still reaches him only on a half-volley"
16.3,"Bumrah to Dubey, OUT","bouncer at 140ks, head high, and Dube is under pressure to go after it. It is so hard to control them from this height. Caught at deep midwicket. Bumrah too good"
16.2,"Bumrah to Dubey, no run",skiddy quick ball just short of a length. Another dot. The perfect in-between length
16.1,"Bumrah to Dubey, no run","short of a length, quick, cramping him up. Defended back to him"
15.6,"Pollard to Dubey, 1 run","another slower offcutter, slightly fuller, driven to deep cover for one"
15.5,"Pollard to Dubey, no run","slower offcutter, 116ks, short of a length, and the turn beats him as he looks to open the face"
15.4,"Pollard to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, punched down to long-on for one"
15.3,"Pollard to Dubey, 1 run","short of a length, uses his height to get it chest high. Fended to leg for one"
15.2,"Pollard to AB, OUT","and he has hit a full toss straight to deep square leg. They are checking it for height, but I feel it is always dipping on de Villiers. He is given so make it four de Villiers wickets for Pollard in eight. Looks like a juicy full toss, but it dips down on him in the last third of its journey, and he ends up mis-hitting straight down the lap of deep square leg"
15.1,"Pollard to AB, 2 runs","slower ball, he goes inside-out, and places this square of deep cover for two"
14.6,"Chahar to Padikkal, no run","gets lucky with this sort ball as Padikkal is early into the pull, toe-ending this back to Chahar"
14.5,"Chahar to Padikkal, 2 runs","quick, straight, worked to deep midwicket for two"
14.4,"Chahar to Padikkal, FOUR runs","misfielded at point. Chahar fires this in short, Padikkal cuts it in air, dying in front of Krunal Pandya at point. Pandya goes for the catch and dives forward, and he reaches it too. But the hands come down late, and it squeezes under them"
14.3,"Chahar to Padikkal, FOUR runs","and Padikkal is back now, expecting a flatter delivery. He gets it, and he leans back to late=cut this between point and short third man"
14.2,"Chahar to Padikkal, SIX runs",looks like the wrong'un to me but either way it is too full. Padikkal clears the front leg and lofts him hard back over his head. Excellent intent from RCB
14.1,"Chahar to Padikkal, no run","goes back to late-cut a slow legbreak, but can't beat point"
13.6,"Pattinson to AB, no run","short of a length, quick, outside off, 144ks, gets a little big on him, and he ends up pushing this back to him"
13.5,"Pattinson to AB, FOUR runs","slower ball, short of a length, and just slides down too much, and de Villiers pulls this square of long leg for four"
13.4,"Pattinson to AB, SIX runs","on-pace full ball, de Villiers is quick to go across, bend his back knee onto the ground and ramp this over the keeper's head for a six. Incredible shot. This is death overs already the way AB is batting"
13.3,"Pattinson to Padikkal, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, 127ks, whipped to long leg for one"
13.2,"Pattinson to AB, 1 run",short of a length. he is deep in the crease to pull this. Gets a single to deep square leg
13.1,"Pattinson to Padikkal, 1 run","length ball outside off, he looks for the big slog, gets a thick inside edge into the leg side"
12.6,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 run","full and quick, just outside off, punched down to long-off for one"
12.6,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 wide",wide as Chahar slides too far down leg in trying to deny him room
12.5,"Chahar to Padikkal, no run","quick, full legbreak, draws a dot"
12.4,"Chahar to AB, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, uppishly punched down to long-off"
12.3,"Chahar to AB, no run","looks for a reverse-paddle this time, but ends up dinking it straight to slip. Good job he has swept this into the ground"
12.2,"Chahar to AB, no run","wider legbreak, de Villiers likes the flight so he goes after it, but is beaten by the turn"
12.1,"Chahar to AB, no run","slow legbreak, just the slight bit of turn, and beats his tentative push"
11.6,"Bumrah to AB, 1 run","short again, about rib high, he gets on his toes to steer this to third man for one"
11.5,"Bumrah to AB, no run","bouncer to de Villiers too. He sways out of its line, and he has to hurry up as he does that because it is following him"
11.4,"Bumrah to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length, pushed down the ground, and the timing is so good that mid-on has to put in a desperate dive to keep this in"
11.3,"Bumrah to Padikkal, no run","slower ball, outside off, beats him on the outside edge with the offcutter"
11.2,"Bumrah to Kohli, OUT","and Bumrah gets to No. 100 with Kohli's wicket. A smart catch by Tiwary at midwicket. Not for the first time Kohli has fallen to a short ball. He looks to pull this but gets a massive top edge. Tiwary has to back-pedal, which he does, and gets to the right of the ball. So he is catching this over his shoulder and on his natural side. Well done. This is a short ball that has got big on him as his weight is still forward when pulling"
11.1,"Bumrah to Kohli, 2 runs","short of a length, into the body, placed to the left of long leg for two"
10.6,"Krunal to Padikkal, FOUR runs","Padikkal continues to punish the spinners. Short of a length, quick, looking to protect the over, but he has gone back and punched this wide of extra cover. And deep cover is far too square. That is an excellent fifty, in which he has kept the intent up even after the Powerplay"
10.5,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run","slower in the air, outside off, pushed wide of cover for one"
10.4,"Krunal to Kohli, no run",pulled away but to short midwicket on the bounce
10.3,"Krunal to Kohli, no run","into the pads, beats the inside edge, hits the pad. Another dot"
10.2,"Krunal to Kohli, no run","on a length, around off, pushed to short cover"
10.1,"Krunal to Kohli, no run","nearly a stumping. Uncharacteristic shot, leaving the crease, looking for a big hit. Pandya slides this wide, and he manages to get some bat on it. Otherwise gone"
9.6,"Chahar to Padikkal, no run","slower in the air, straighter, gets some turn, hits him on the pad, but it is headed down leg"
9.5,"Chahar to Padikkal, FOUR runs","Padikkal keeps beating the man at deep cover. Chahar is looking to sliders short of a length to bowl to his field, but Padikkal has cut to the left of that man twice in this over"
9.4,"Chahar to Kohli, 1 run","full and straight, wristily driven to long-on for one"
9.3,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 run","shorter this time, cut to deep cover for one"
9.2,"Chahar to Padikkal, FOUR runs","slider, on a length, and he goes back to cut it late and cut it powerfully. He has also placed this in front of deep cover"
9.1,"Chahar to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length, straight, worked to leg for one"
8.6,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run","full outside off, driven down to long-off for one"
8.5,"Krunal to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length, middle and leg, punched down to long-on for one"
8.4,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run","slow, on a length, outside off, pushed wide of cover for one"
8.3,"Krunal to Kohli, no run",nearly a return catch. Looks to work this to leg but is early into the shot. The leading edge falls well short of the bowler
8.2,"Krunal to Kohli, no run",inside edge onto the pad as he plays for the turn but this goes on with the arm
8.1,"Krunal to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length, straight, worked to leg for one"
7.6,"Chahar to Kohli, 2 runs","and nearly a chance for slip. Short of a length, legbreak, Kohli looks to push this to cover, but the ball turns to take the edge. Wide of slip, though"
7.5,"Chahar to Philippe, OUT","appeal for stumping as he looks to go over extra again but Chahar shortens the length and gives it time to turn past his bat. Philippe has only just left the crease, which means he has the time to get back in, especially since de Kock doesn't deal in Dhoni-like no-give stumpings. But his back foot is in the air when he breaks the wicket"
7.4,"Chahar to Philippe, FOUR runs","they are taking spin on. Philippe showins off his wares? Where have you been so far young man? Leaves the crease, gets to its pitch and drives this over extra cover. Stylish"
7.3,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 run",guides this quick length ball to fine leg for one
7.2,"Chahar to Padikkal, FOUR runs",this is an even better sweep. A tall man playing sweeps efficiently. This time is the reverse variety. It has the keeper excited because he has taken this from in front of the wicket and really full. Places this to the left of short third man
7.1,"Chahar to Padikkal, 2 runs",again he plays the paddle sweep to the first ball from a new spinner. Both are quickish spinners. So he uses the pace to place this fine of fine leg
6.6,"Krunal to Padikkal, 1 run","on a length, straighter, pushed down to long-on for one"
6.5,"Krunal to Padikkal, no run","slider, length ball, angling across him, and skids through to beat him on the outside edge"
6.4,"Krunal to Philippe, 1 run","yes he has Smith-like trigger movements, he completes his down-the-ground swings like Haddin. The latter is stylish. Single to deep cover"
6.3,"Krunal to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length, 93ks, but slow off the surface. Worked to deep square leg for one"
6.2,"Krunal to Philippe, 1 run","makes room, Pandya follows him. Punched to deep midwicket for one"
6.1,"Krunal to Philippe, 2 runs","lovely reverse sweep first ball. The length is a touch short for the shot, but he sweeps down on it, and drags from around leg. And keeps it down too. And beats short third man to his right"
5.6,"Pattinson to Padikkal, FOUR runs",makes room to take this length ball and drive it over cover for four. Excellent Powerplay for RCB
5.5,"Pattinson to Padikkal, no run","short of a length, at off, no room, fended to cover"
5.4,"Pattinson to Philippe, 1 run","bouncer, pulled down to long leg for one"
5.3,"Pattinson to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length, straight, worked away to long leg for one"
5.2,"Pattinson to Padikkal, 2 runs","follows him with a short ball as he backs away, and tucked to the right of long leg this time. Comes back for two"
5.1,"Pattinson to Padikkal, FOUR runs","gets down leg this time, and Padikkal tucks this fine, fine of long leg for four"
4.6,"Boult to Philippe, FOUR runs","lucky runs but intent often good tends to do that. He looks to pull this cross-seam short ball at around off, and gets a bottom edge past de Kock for four"
4.5,"Boult to Philippe, no run","shapes up for a ramp, and Boult slips in a big bouncer. It keeps rising even after crossing Philippe, and de Kock times his jump perfectly to take it one-handed"
4.4,"Boult to Philippe, no run","makes room to crunch this short-of-a-length ball away, but straight to cover point"
4.3,"Boult to Philippe, no run","short of a length, outside off, pushes at it with an open face"
4.2,"Boult to Philippe, SIX runs","slower ball, 114ks, but it doesn't matter to Philippe who extends his arms through this length ball and goes straight back over his head. Looks a little like Brad Haddin in executing this shot"
4.1,"Boult to Philippe, no run","leading edge as he shuffles across and looks to work this to leg. This goes with the angle, and takes the front edge. Safe"
3.6,"Pattinson to Padikkal, no run","short ball has him in trouble but it doesn't carry to short third man. Padikkal is off his feet trying to ride the bounce as this follows him. He fends at it, but can't quite control it"
3.5,"Pattinson to Philippe, 1 run","short of a length, straight, he moves across to work this to long leg for one"
3.4,"Pattinson to Philippe, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Pattinson bowls short but he is in position with his back and across trigger movement. Likes the pull shot, and he beats long leg to his left"
3.3,"Pattinson to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length, good carry, runs this down to third man for one"
3.2,"Pattinson to Padikkal, no run",makes room to try to go over cover but is beaten by a quick ball just outside off
3.1,"Pattinson to Padikkal, FOUR runs","shout of ""catch it"" as he whips this length ball of the pads. There is a man back at square leg, but this has gone towards midwicket. A cute little pick-up shot"
2.6,"Krunal to Philippe, no run","short of a length, straight, pushed to short midwicket"
2.5,"Krunal to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length, around off, punched down to long-on"
2.4,"Krunal to Padikkal, FOUR runs","misfielded at short cover as this one bounces awkwardly off a practice pitch. Short of a length, and he goes back to punch  this only for Boult to let it through"
2.3,"Krunal to Padikkal, FOUR runs","clever batting. He knows Pandya is usually quick so he can use his pace. This is bowled at 99ks, and he has lapped this over the keeper's head"
2.2,"Krunal to Philippe, 1 run","short of a length, straight, pushed wide of short midwicket for one"
2.1,"Krunal to Philippe, 2 runs","sweeps this from wide outside off, places this wide of deep square leg"
1.6,"Bumrah to Padikkal, no run","on a length, holding its line in front of off. Defended"
1.5,"Bumrah to Philippe, 1 run","high full toss, about three-fourths of the way up the stumps. Gets a little big on him. He hits this to mid-off for one"
1.4,"Bumrah to Philippe, FOUR runs","finally gets the line he wants after moving across. This is just outside off, which his movement turns into a pretty straight delivery. He punches this wide of mid-on for four"
1.3,"Bumrah to Philippe, no run","leading edge as he shuffles across again. Bumrah stays outside off, and gets this to hold its line. It falls well short of mid-off"
1.2,"Bumrah to Philippe, no run","short of a length, 138ks, slight seam back, extra bounce, hits him high on the bat"
1.1,"Bumrah to Philippe, no run","on a length, outside off, 144ks, he shuffles across and defends"
0.6,"Boult to Padikkal, no run","short of a length, off and middle. Defended with an open face"
0.5,"Boult to Padikkal, FOUR runs","makes room and thrashes this length ball over short cover for four. Actually just short of a length, which allows him to go with a horizontal bat"
0.4,"Boult to Padikkal, no run","stays on a length, just outside off, and he opens the face on it. Can't get it past point"
0.3,"Boult to Padikkal, no run","on a length, on top of off, defended from the crease"
0.2,"Boult to Philippe, 1 run","swing again, but he shuffles across and clips this to deep square leg"
0.1,"Boult to Philippe, no run",some swing first ball as Philppe shuffles across. Defended back to him
18.6,"Natarajan to Nortje, OUT","taken at square leg. Natarajan shows his bouncer off. It's too much for Nortje, who looks to fetch it with a pull from outside off. Sliced up and swerving, but Garg is steady under it"
18.5,"Natarajan to Nortje, no run","full and just outside off, jammed into the covers"
18.4,"Natarajan to Deshpande, 1 run",looks for the reverse ramp after shaping for the conventional ramp. Ends up going at it too early and gets it off the leading edge to square leg. Low full wide outside off and he was swishing all around that. And it's probably the only ball that brings some smiles to the Delhi dugout tonight
18.3,"Natarajan to Deshpande, no run","low full toss wide outside off, left along"
18.2,"Natarajan to Deshpande, FOUR runs","lofted over the bowler. Low full toss at off stump, gets low with the front leg away and lifts it"
18.1,"Natarajan to Nortje, 1 run","bouncer at middle stump, mistimed pull out towards deep square"
17.6,"Holder to Ashwin, OUT","taken at deep midwicket. Overpitched on a middle stump line, there for the slog. But he's gotten too far under this, off the toe-end of the bat and taken on the line"
17.5,"Holder to Ashwin, 2 runs","yorker at leg stump, squeezed out towards long-on"
17.4,"Holder to Deshpande, 1 run","yorker at middle stump, jammed down to long-on"
17.3,"Holder to Deshpande, SIX runs","flat-batted over the long-off boundary! Whew, they sound sweet when he connects. Short of a length and rising outside off. Gets half a stride on the front foot and hammers that"
17.2,"Holder to Deshpande, 2 runs","full and wide outside off, chucks the hands at this with a cover drive, thick outside edge to third man's right"
17.1,"Holder to Deshpande, FOUR runs","oh sweet! Top-drawer straight drive. This is full and on off stump, he gets the front leg out of the way and drills it cleanly past the stump"
16.6,"Sandeep to Deshpande, 1 run","good length at the stumps, poked through midwicket"
16.5,"Sandeep to Ashwin, 1 run","run-out missed at the non-striker's end. Ashwin hits a pristine punch on the rise, straight to mid-off and barely gets halfway as the fielder shapes to throw. He went for the direct hit with bowler backing up instead of at the stumps"
16.4,"Sandeep to Ashwin, FOUR runs","pulled neatly to deep square's right. Short ball sitting up at middle stump, nicely in position and hits it along the ground"
16.3,"Sandeep to Ashwin, no run",that looks plumb on the lbw but Ashwin has got bat on it. Full and into off stump. Head falls over into the off side as he looks to flick
16.2,"Sandeep to Deshpande, 1 run",full and into the corridor. Mistimed slog off the inside half to long-on
16.1,"Sandeep to Pant, OUT","big appeal for catch behind. Umpire has signaled wide. Warner takes the review. It's a full ball dipping away wide outside off. He reaches out and looks for the drive through point. On early viewing, the bat has definitely hit the ground. But there is a tiny spike on Ultra Edge as the ball goes past bat before that. The bat hits the ground a few frames after that. The third umpire has gone on the evidence of sound and overturned the decision"
15.6,"Natarajan to Rabada, OUT",yorker into the base of off stump. Sum up a bowler in one line. Seam upright and past Rabada's attempted drive through the off side
15.5,"Natarajan to Rabada, no run","short and wide outside off, steps out and is beaten on the cut"
15.4,"Natarajan to Pant, 1 run","tough catch dropped at extra cover. Full and just outside off, gets on one knee and drills the cover drive. It's waist height and swerving away from Abhishek Sharma. He gets parallel to the ground and sticks out a right hand. Parries it towards sweeper cover"
15.3,"Natarajan to Pant, no run","beaten by a friendly full toss. Loses his shape and smiles sheepishly. This was outside off, and he was looking to send it some 300 metres into the leg side"
15.2,"Natarajan to Pant, 2 runs",low full toss into the front thigh. Mistimed slog to deep square's left
15.1,"Natarajan to Pant, FOUR runs","pumped past the bowler. Slower ball at a length wide outside off, slides on nicely as he gets forward. Slapped on the rise ad long-off has no chance to the left"
14.6,"Holder to Pant, 1 run","low full toss outside off, sliced to deep point's left"
14.6,"Holder to Pant, 1 wide",full and very wide outside off. Left alone

14.4,"Holder to Pant, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven uppishly to mid-off"
14.3,"Holder to Pant, FOUR runs","low full toss wide outside off. Sliced to deep point's right. Rashid makes the ground and puts in a slide, but has over-done the slide in the end and is reaching out. Gets a hand but the momentum pushes it into the padding"
14.2,"Holder to Pant, no run","yorker wide outside off, beaten on the chop"
14.1,"Holder to Rabada, 1 run","short of a length and wide outside off, mistimed cut to sweeper cover"

12.6,"Rashid Khan to Rabada, no run","good length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
12.5,"Rashid Khan to Axar Patel, OUT","swiped straight to deep midwicket. Full ball outside off, half a stride out for the slog and he's not close enough to generate power on it. It's off the inside half and floats out to Garg"
12.4,"Rashid Khan to Axar Patel, no run","full on leg stump, flicked to midwicket"
12.3,"Rashid Khan to Axar Patel, no run","full and down leg side, looks to flick and it deflects to short fine off the pad"

12.1,"Rashid Khan to Pant, no run","good length outside off, defended into the covers"

11.4,"Shankar to Pant, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length on leg stump. Swiped to deep square's left"
11.3,"Shankar to Iyer, OUT",taken at extra cover. Slower ball dug in short and wide outside off. He checks himself on the lofted cut. Ends up dabbing it for Williamson running back
11.2,"Shankar to Pant, 1 run","short at middle stump, pulled to deep square's left"
11.1,"Shankar to Iyer, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length and just outside off. Mistimed pull to deep square"
10.6,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, 1 run","length at the stumps, punched to long-on off the back foot"
10.5,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, no run",squares him as he beats the outside edge. Good length and ripping away from off stump. He was shaping to poke that through midwicket
10.4,"Rashid Khan to Pant, 1 run","good length and spinning into off stump. Looks to whip off the back foot, gets it onto his back leg"
10.3,"Rashid Khan to Pant, no run","googly, good length and outside off. Punched back to the bowler off the back foot"

10.1,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, no run","good length and just outside off, jabbed to short third man"

8.4,"Rashid Khan to Pant, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep square's left"
8.3,"Rashid Khan to Pant, no run","googly at a length on leg stump, defended off the back foot"
8.2,"Rashid Khan to Pant, no run",good length and turning in towards middle stump. Shuffles and looks to whip off the hips. Cops it on the thigh pad and survives the lbw appeal
8.1,"Rashid Khan to Pant, no run","full on middle stump, flicked to midwicket"
7.6,"Natarajan to Pant, 1 run","low full toss at middle stump, punched straight to midwicket who fumbles and gives them a run at long-on"
7.5,"Natarajan to Pant, no run","full and just outside off, driven ambitiously, but with little force, to extra cover"
7.4,"Natarajan to Pant, SIX runs","swept over square leg! Vintage Pant. Good length ball in at middle and off. He gets on one knee and pulls out one of the cleanest sweeps, right off the middle"

6.6,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, no run","inside edge onto pad. Googly, good length and wide outside off. Looks to drive away from the body"
6.5,"Rashid Khan to Rahane, OUT","lbw appeal given. Two sounds on it. Rahane runs the timer out and decides not to review. it's a quick googly outside off, he's on the front foot for the block. He's beaten on the inside edge and is right in front of off and middle. No question on the line there. And seemingly no edge on that"
6.4,"Rashid Khan to Rahane, no run","short of a length and just outside off, punched back to the bowler"
6.3,"Rashid Khan to Pant, 1 run","short and wide outside off, going away from him. Cut to sweeper cover"

6.1,"Rashid Khan to Hetmyer, OUT","clips off stump first ball! Good length, a slider starting from just outside off stump. It's a regulation legbreak. Hetmyer backs away and looks to drive through the covers with all stumps exposed. It marginally gets the outside edge of the off stump"
5.6,"Holder to Rahane, 4 leg byes",past the keeper. Good length and onto the pads. Gets forward for the flick and it defects off the thigh guard
5.5,"Holder to Rahane, SIX runs","pulls it over the midwicket boundary. Short of a length at middle stump, rising up at the hips and he gets his weight onto the front foot as he pulls"
5.4,"Holder to Hetmyer, 1 run","short of a length at off stump, pushed to point's left"
5.3,"Holder to Hetmyer, FOUR runs","slogged to the midwicket boundary. Good length and just outside off, onto the front foot and across the angle he goes"
5.2,"Holder to Hetmyer, FOUR runs",past backward point's jump. Full and wide outside off. Reaches out and chops at that. Nadeem stretches high to his left with both hands and only manages a fingertip on it

3.5,"Holder to Hetmyer, 1 run","short at middle stump, crunches the hook out to deep square"
3.4,"Holder to Hetmyer, no run","missed run-out chance as the ball slips out of Holder's hand. A yorker at off stump, jammed pitch side on the off side. Hetmyer takes off for a speculative run and is sent back. Holder's lost the ball just as he looks to release the throw"

2.6,"Sandeep to Hetmyer, no run","good length on leg stump, flicked to miwicket"
2.5,"Sandeep to Rahane, 1 run","survives a run-out chance at the non-striker's end. Good length and just outside off, punched to straight extra cover's right and takes off.

1.6,"Nadeem to Stoinis, OUT",slapped straight to mid-off! Good length and sliding into middle stump. He backs away to make room and meets this on the up with an angled bat. Possibly looking to go over mid-off but he gets no elevation. Straight into Warner's lap

0.3,"Sandeep to S Dhawan, OUT",taken at mid-off! They have Delhi's form batsman for a golden duck. Classic Sandeep - a full ball hooping away from middle and off stump. Dhawan looks to force a flick through midwicket and closes the face too early. It's off the leading edge and Warner tracks it nicely as he takes short steps backwards and to his right
0.2,"Sandeep to Rahane, 1 run",full and swung in at off stump. Walks down at it and punches to long-on

19.3,"Rabada to Williamson, 1 run","full and into the toes, flicked to deep square"

18.4,"Nortje to Pandey, no run","lifts his foot to save his toes! There are peculiarities on offer every time Pandey is out in the middle, but this one is new. A yorker headed for his foot and he just lifts it. It slides through between the boot and leg stump"
18.3,"Nortje to Pandey, FOUR runs","thick edge over short third man. Full slower ball outside off, looks to blaze it over extra cover. The ball grips and rises"
18.3,"Nortje to Pandey, 1 wide","good length and very wide outside off, left alone"
18.2,"Nortje to Williamson, 1 run",full and dipping slower ball outside off again. Lunges out at that and flicks to deep square

17.6,"Stoinis to Williamson, no run","short of a length at middle stump, backs into the leg side and punches straight to extra cover"
17.5,"Stoinis to Pandey, 1 run","slower ball, sliding on low at a length and wide outside off. Shuffles and slogs to deep midwicket off the thick inside edge"
17.4,"Stoinis to Williamson, 1 run","full slower ball at middle stump. Shuffles and flicks, gets it off the inside edge and towards short fine"
17.3,"Stoinis to Pandey, 1 run",full slower ball wide outside off. Gets on a knee and looks to loft that over extra. Comes off the toe-end and floats down to long-on
17.2,"Stoinis to Pandey, 2 runs",swatted to long-on's right. Another high full toss. Dew already? This is outside off and he drags it into the leg side with a pull
17.1,"Stoinis to Williamson, 1 run",short and into leg stump. Backs away and pulls to deep square
16.6,"Deshpande to Pandey, SIX runs",just over deep midwicket. High full toss swerving in at middle stump. On the front foot again and with swinging room. Comes off the high part of the bat but there's enough pace on that
16.5,"Deshpande to Pandey, FOUR runs","pulled between deep midwicket and long-on. Slower short ball, sitting up outside off. Deshpande has fed Pandey his two favourite shots this over - this one is the front foot pull"
16.4,"Deshpande to Pandey, no run",full toss straight onto his thigh as he walks down. Hurriedly whips it straight to square leg
16.3,"Deshpande to Pandey, FOUR runs","hammered past the bowler. Loves the straight drives. This one is in the slot, just outside off, he half-steps into the leg side and gets it into the straight boundary, all along the ground"
16.2,"Deshpande to Pandey, no run","full and just outside off, looks to club through the leg side and gets an inside edge onto boot"

15.5,"Axar Patel to Pandey, no run","good length outside off, steps out and swings through the line. Inside edge onto pad"
15.4,"Axar Patel to Pandey, no run","nicely bowled. Anticipating that Pandey will step out. Pushes it flat and slides it off a length, into his body. Steps out and taps it back to the bowler"
15.4,"Axar Patel to Pandey, 1 wide","good length and down leg side, left alone"
15.3,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","good length and into off stump, backs away and punches to sweeper"
15.2,"Axar Patel to Pandey, 1 leg bye",good length and sliding onto the pads as he steps out. Looks to flick and it deflects to short third man's left

14.6,"Nortje to Pandey, FOUR runs",crunched over the non-striker. Full and at off stump. Clears the front leg as he walks down the pitch and swings sweetly on the rise
14.5,"Nortje to Pandey, no run","good length and just outside off, looks to punch on the up towards long-on. Gets an inside edge onto pad"
14.5,"Nortje to Pandey, 1 wide",short ball outside off. Too short. Pandey can't get a pull attempt on it
14.4,"Nortje to Pandey, no run","length and just outside off, 147.9kph, punched into the covers"
14.3,"Nortje to Saha, OUT","looks to clear mid-off again, but the bowler's adjusted his length. Slams it into a length just outside off. Saha backs away for another loft, but that keeps getting big on him and he can only end up lofting it like they do at catching practice. Mid-off takes it easily. Falls short of a hundred by 13 runs, but he has done a fantastic job tonight in a more familiar role"
14.2,"Nortje to Saha, FOUR runs",gently lofted wide of mid-off. Full and into leg stump. Takes stance down leg side with the stumps exposed and then waits on this drive and opens the face late
14.1,"Nortje to Pandey, 1 run","full and just outside off, front leg clear as he nails this drive along the ground. Long-on cleans up to his left"
13.6,"Stoinis to Saha, FOUR runs","backs away and ramps to third man. Slower short ball rising at off stump, Walks into the leg side and deliberately stabs between keeper and short third"

13.4,"Stoinis to Saha, 1 run","short outside off, steps out and gets an under-edge on the pull"

13.2,"Stoinis to Pandey, 1 run",short and rising in the corridor. Miscued pull to long-on's left
13.1,"Stoinis to Pandey, 2 runs","slower short ball wide outside off, pulled to long-on's right"
12.6,"Rabada to Saha, SIX runs",sweet sound on the pull over midwicket. Short of a length and just outside off. Backs away and times it perfectly. Picks his spot well too. There's no one back on the boundary and this dips into the boundary padding on the full
12.5,"Rabada to Saha, 4 leg byes",deflected off the body and into the third man boundary. It's a slower short ball at off stump. He's through the attempted pull early. It hits the him on the right shoulder and trickles past the keeper
12.4,"Rabada to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length on middle stump, gets behind that and nudges into midwicket"
12.3,"Rabada to Saha, 1 run","just short of third man. Full and just outside off, looks to go inside-out over cover, ends up slicing it a bit too much"
12.2,"Rabada to Saha, 2 runs",short of a length and just outside off. Cuts aerially to third man's right
12.1,"Rabada to Saha, no run",good length and into leg stump. Looks to flick aerially and cops that in the mid-riff
11.6,"Axar Patel to Saha, 1 run","good length and just outside off, steps out and punches to deep extra cover"
11.5,"Axar Patel to Saha, FOUR runs",oh lovely placement. They brought cover in and put extra cover out. Saha backs away and punches this length ball to that deep fielder's left off the back foot. Rabada gets a hand on it too with a dive to his left. Manages to push it into the padding with the momentum
11.4,"Axar Patel to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length and outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
11.3,"Axar Patel to Saha, 3 runs","good length and into leg stump, shuffles into the off side, exposes the stumps and gets a delicate ramp to the keeper's left. Ashwin gives chase and takes an inelegant tumble"

11.1,"Axar Patel to Saha, no run","good length and just outside off, steps out and drives to extra cover"
10.6,"Deshpande to Saha, 1 leg bye",full slower ball just past leg stump. Looks to flick and cops that on the pad as it dips on him
10.5,"Deshpande to Pandey, 3 runs","mistimed lofted drive. To mid-off's left. Good length and into middle stump. Makes room and drives on the up, but the bat turns in his hand. Iyer gives chase and pulls it in"
10.4,"Deshpande to Saha, 1 run","low full toss at off stump, leans in and flicks to deep square"
10.3,"Deshpande to Saha, FOUR runs","caressed to the point boundary. Short of a length just outside off, waits on that with the feet static, and then opens the face late to punch this to point's left"
10.2,"Deshpande to Saha, FOUR runs","places the pull to deep square's right for his fifty. This is no flash in the pan, Saha has a superb IPL record as an opener. And in his first game as opener, he's cashed in. Short of a length ball into leg stump, he's cramped a touch but manages to pull from under it and bisect the two fielders in the deep"
10.1,"Deshpande to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, off the floor as he opens the face and guides to third man"
9.6,"Ashwin to Saha, FOUR runs","one-handed swipe to the long leg boundary. This looks like a knuckle ball, good length and moving away from middle stump. He got low and well forward in reaching out for this. Bottom hand came off as he swept"
9.5,"Ashwin to Saha, 2 runs",good length and turning away just outside off. Punched on the up to sweeper's right
9.4,"Ashwin to Warner, OUT","taken at extra cover. Slows it way down this time, Ashwin, and manages to find some grip and turn. Warner looking to hit this full leg-stump ball with the angle, into the leg side. Ends up slicing it as it turns away and it's an easy catch. Top bowling that to end one of the best knocks of the season"
9.3,"Ashwin to Warner, FOUR runs",long-off does well to get a hand but only manages to swat it into the boundary padding to his left. Length ball pushed through fast and he made room to slap this on the up. Nortje ran to his left and looked to push that in on the half-volley with his left hand
9.2,"Ashwin to Saha, 1 run","good length on middle stump, gets forward and flicks to deep square"

8.4,"Deshpande to Warner, 2 runs","full and just outside off, driven to mid-off's right and his throw at the non-striker's end is misfielded by the fielder backing up at square leg. They get an extra run"
8.3,"Deshpande to Saha, 1 run",full and just outside off. Makes room to try and drive to mid-off's left. Doesn't connect well enough
8.2,"Deshpande to Warner, 1 run","full and just outside off, hangs leg side of that and lifts this cover drive to sweeper's left"
8.1,"Deshpande to Saha, 1 run","low full toss at leg stump, flicked to deep square"

7.3,"Ashwin to Saha, 1 run","short of a length outside off, cut to sweeper cover"

6.6,"Axar Patel to Saha, 1 run","full and into off stump, leans in and flicks to deep square"

5.5,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs",slashed to the backward this man boundary for the fifty! Oh this is some birthday bash for Warner. A 25-ball half-century. This is on a length and pushed wide of him and he reaches out with an open face. There is a sweeper point but he won't get close
5.4,"Rabada to Warner, SIX runs",launched it over wide long-on! Short of a length and at middle stump again. This time he doesn't defend - makes room instead and takes him on with the pull and nails the connection this time
5.3,"Rabada to Warner, no run","good length and cramped on off stump, defended into the off side"
5.2,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs","slapped over extra cover. Good length and pushed wide outside off. Front leg in the leg side, arms reaching way outside off and lifted on the rise"

4.5,"Axar Patel to Warner, FOUR runs","punched wide of mid-off and beats his sprint too. Good length and into middle stump. Had to jump quickly into the leg side to make room, but did it well enough for the power into the punch"

4.3,"Axar Patel to Warner, no run","dropped short and wide, waits on that and hits the cut straight to extra cover"

3.5,"Nortje to Warner, 2 runs","good length and into leg stump, uses the angle to deep square's left"
3.4,"Nortje to Warner, FOUR runs","slower short ball wide outside off, quick feet as he jumps out to reach that and then cut it between backward point and cover"
3.3,"Nortje to Warner, FOUR runs","crunches it past the bowler. Warner again with the front leg well out of the way, and this is a full ball just outside off"
3.2,"Nortje to Warner, no run","good length and just outside off, punched into the covers"
3.1,"Nortje to Warner, 2 runs",good length and into the pads. Uses the angle to flick this aerially over midwicket. Safely wide of deep square

2.2,"Ashwin to Warner, no run",short of a length and sliding into his body again as he looks to open up the covers with a punch
2.1,"Ashwin to Warner, no run",good length and sliding into leg stump. Looks to to back away and punch through cover but finds extra
1.6,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run","good length and just outside off, allows it on and jabs it to third man's left. Slips at the other end as he thinks of the second"
1.5,"Rabada to Saha, 1 run","full at off stump, looks to drive on the rise and gets it off the thick inside edge to mid-on"
1.4,"Rabada to Saha, 2 runs","just clears cover. Length ball outside off, gets a stride out and looks to lift that over the infield on the up, but that comes off the toe end and plonks into the turf past the back-pedaling Stoinis"
1.3,"Rabada to Saha, FOUR runs","flicked past square leg. Full and into the pads. Waits on that and flicks aerially, but safely to the diving fielder's right"
1.2,"Rabada to Saha, FOUR runs","inside edge past the keeper and into the fine leg boundary. Good length and just outside off, reaches out at that and looks to drive on the up. Possibly through the leg side. Didn't get anywhere near it"
1.1,"Rabada to Warner, 3 runs",swiped over mid-on. Good length and just outside off. Keeps the front leg in the leg side and swings across the line. It comes off the inside half. Deshpande pulls it back in with a slide at the boundary
0.6,"Nortje to Saha, no run",beaten on the edge. Short of a length and rising up in the corridor as he feels for it
0.5,"Nortje to Saha, FOUR runs",hurried pull but a controlled one in the end. This is short of a length and into his body. Pulled off the high part and well to fine leg's left
0.4,"Nortje to Saha, no run","short of a length and curving away outside off, mistimed punch on the up"
0.3,"Nortje to Warner, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched into the covers off the back foot. A direct hit at the striker's end from Axar Patel. It deflects towards the midwicket boundary but Saha's gone a long way after grounding his bat and the chance of a second is gone"
0.2,"Nortje to Warner, no run","good length and just outside off, angled in. Defended to midwicket off the inside half"
0.1,"Nortje to Warner, no run","full and into off stump, watchfully pushed into the covers"
18.5,"Ferguson to Pooran, 1 run","sealed with a leg-bye. That is five straight wins. Short of a length again, quick again, but they run off the thigh pad. There might have been an inside edge because the umpire hasn't ruled this a leg-bye"
18.4,"Ferguson to Mandeep, 1 run","nearly a run-out. Short of a length, just outside off, he opens the face, but the point is in close. Pooran has to go back, but they will get the overthrow"
18.3,"Ferguson to Pooran, 1 run","short of a length, quick, runs this down to third man for one"
18.2,"Ferguson to Pooran, no run","full, fast, 147ks, some movement away. Beats the outside edge"
18.1,"Ferguson to Gayle, OUT","massive slower ball. At 122ks. He is looking to leave it, but it is still there in front of his face. So he looks to ramp it, but ends up gloving it to short third man. Stand up and applaud another Gayle special. The game was in the balance when he came out to bat. The game is no more now"
17.6,"Cummins to Mandeep, SIX runs","and Mandeep celebrates this performance with a six. Again Cummins misses his yorker mark by a few inches, and this time he goes to his favourite area: over midwicket"
17.5,"Cummins to Mandeep, no run","bouncer, looks to ramp it away, but it is too high. Not called a wide"
17.4,"Cummins to Mandeep, FOUR runs","just short of the yorker length, and he goes over extra cover for four more. Hit off the cue, but has enough in it to clear the infield"
17.3,"Cummins to Mandeep, no run","looks to move around in the crease, and Cummins slips in a wide yorker to earn a dot"
17.2,"Cummins to Gayle, 1 run","another yorker, dug out for one to long-on"
17.1,"Cummins to Gayle, no run","starts off with the perfect yorker, in front of off. Dug out back to him"

16.5,"Ferguson to Mandeep, 1 run","slower ball, nearly a yorker, dug out for one"
16.4,"Ferguson to Gayle, 1 run","short of a length again, inside edge, just short and wide of the keeper. That is the fifty. He flashes the big smile and ""The Boss"" sign on the back of his bat. And this time it is written the right way, and not upside-down"
16.3,"Ferguson to Gayle, no run","even shorter than last ball, and somehow manages to stay full of the pulling length. Defended"
16.2,"Ferguson to Gayle, SIX runs","oh Gayle at his best. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this ball except that it is bowled to Universe Boss. Short of a length, rib-high, 140-plus ks, and still he punches this over mid-off for a six. That is extraordinary"
16.1,"Ferguson to Gayle, FOUR runs","lovely bouncer at 146ks, gets it shoulder high, but the top edge goes fine of fine leg for four"
15.6,"Prasidh to Mandeep, FOUR runs","regal pull shot. Short, outside off, and he pulls the pants off it. In front of square it goes. One-bounce four again"
15.5,"Prasidh to Gayle, 1 run","short of a length, around off, no room. Opens the face on this"
15.4,"Prasidh to Mandeep, 1 run","yorker, runs off the inside half of the bat for one. Singh looks to the skies and blows a kiss. Paying tribute to his father, whom he lost three days ago. Can't believe how he is even managing to play, let alone compete at such high level. A special fifty"
15.3,"Prasidh to Mandeep, no run","short of a length, just outside off, opens the face, but can't place it wide of point"
15.2,"Prasidh to Mandeep, FOUR runs","short, and Singh gets inside the line to pull this to deep midwicket. Into the fence, on the first bounce"

14.6,"Varun to Mandeep, 1 run","wrong'un, goes back to push this down to long-on for one"
14.5,"Varun to Gayle, 1 run","short of a length, and he goes back to bludgeon it down the ground, straight of long-on. Tripathi puts in a big dive to keep them down to one"
14.4,"Varun to Gayle, 2 runs","on a length, quick, angling across him, pushed between point and cover-point, and he comes back for two"
14.3,"Varun to Mandeep, 1 run","this one looks like the other one, and he goes back punch this into the leg side for one"
14.2,"Varun to Mandeep, no run","slower in the air, drags the length back, pushed to extra cover"
14.1,"Varun to Mandeep, FOUR runs","legcutter, too full, and Singh drops his back knee to drive him over extra cover. Lovely shot"
13.6,"Ferguson to Mandeep, 1 leg bye","slower ball, on a length, into the pads, beats his pull, concedes a leg-bye"
13.6,"Ferguson to Mandeep, 1 wide","another bouncer, 148ks, but he has gone too high with it"
13.5,"Ferguson to Mandeep, no run","quick bouncer, 152ks. Singh looks to use the pace and upper-cut him, but it is too quick for him"
13.4,"Ferguson to Mandeep, FOUR runs","full and fast, 152.5ks, but the pace doesn't matter if you pitch it in the slot. He drives this wide of long-on for four. That is the one shot he has enjoyed tonight"
13.3,"Ferguson to Gayle, 1 run","short of a length again, pushed to the right of pint, and Rana puts a dive in but the collection is not clean. They pinch the single"
13.2,"Ferguson to Gayle, no run","short of a length, outside off, he looks to run it down, gets a bottom edge through to the keeper"
13.1,"Ferguson to Mandeep, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, runs this down to third man for one"
12.6,"Narine to Gayle, no run","carrom ball, beats him, hits him on the pad, but is turning too much after pitching on leg"
12.5,"Narine to Gayle, 2 runs",but now he will amble through for a couple after dunking this length ball into a gap deep on the leg side
12.4,"Narine to Gayle, no run","on a length, outside off, pushed to point. He is not charging through for ones"
12.3,"Narine to Gayle, SIX runs","too short, too slow, and Gayle goes deep in the crease to pull this over wide long-on. They keep writing him off every year, but Gayle keeps writing himself back in"
12.2,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run","on a length, outside off, punches this square of deep cover, but Gayle is not sprinting a tight second"
12.1,"Narine to Gayle, 1 run","offbreak, on a length, and he pushes this just wide of cover for a quick single"
11.6,"Ferguson to Gayle, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, runs this down to third man"
11.5,"Ferguson to Gayle, FOUR runs","that is how difficult it is to bowl to Gayle. Ferguson has nearly nailed this yorker, but Gayle takes this on the full and opens the face to beat point to his right"
11.4,"Ferguson to Mandeep, 1 run","slower legcutter, Singh plays the late-cut, but the man at point gets a hand to it with a dive"
11.3,"Ferguson to Mandeep, no run","shorter, meaner, 140ks, and beats him on the hook. Gets is higher than the shoulder"
11.2,"Ferguson to Mandeep, no run","gets the length right now. Short of a length, 145ks, jags back in, beats the inside edge"
11.1,"Ferguson to Mandeep, FOUR runs","not with on-pace length balls, no he won't. Singh is staying deep to loft this. Goes wide of long-on"
10.6,"Narine to Gayle, SIX runs","gets one in his slot, well in his slot, and Gaule depostis this leg-side half-volley over wide long-on. Such smart batting. Nothing to do with length balls, and take toll of the full ones"
10.5,"Narine to Gayle, no run","on a length, outside off, and he has left it alone. Gayle is not taking any risks against Narine"
10.4,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run","offbreak, starts straight, concedes a leg-bye even though he has beaten him"
10.3,"Narine to Gayle, 1 run","down the leg side, plays the vertical sweep to long leg for one"
10.2,"Narine to Gayle, no run","on a length, straight, punched to midwicket"
10.1,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run",Singh chips the first ball to long-off for one
9.6,"Varun to Gayle, SIX runs","he is going to take the risk with the googly, look to buy the wicket, but again just a touch too full. Gayle knows he can clear this field with a mis-hit if this is in his zone. And this is not sweetly hit, and yet the skier clears long-off with ease"
9.5,"Varun to Gayle, SIX runs","Mr Gayle announces himself. Varun makes the mistake of bowling a touch too full, and Gayle knows he is clearing this short boundary if it is in his zone. Goes over long-on"
9.4,"Varun to Gayle, no run","quick legcutter, beats him on the outside edge as he defends"
9.3,"Varun to Mandeep, 1 run","wide and skiddy, cut away to deep cover"
9.2,"Varun to Mandeep, FOUR runs","Singh pulls out a timely reverse hit. This is a legcutter, outside off, and bounces on him. Seems like he has been beaten but he catches up with it and sends it over short third man"
9.1,"Varun to Mandeep, no run","on a length, outside off, cut away, but straight to point"
8.6,"Narine to Gayle, no run","on a length, on off. Gayle pays him respect. Defends"
8.5,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run","seam-up knuckle ball, chipped off the outside edge, over the bowler's head"
8.4,"Narine to Mandeep, no run","offbreak, slow, and stays low, and takes the inside edge onto the pad"
8.3,"Narine to Gayle, 1 run","slow length ball, outside off, he opens the face, gets a single as the diving slip deflects this into a gap"
8.2,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run","into the pads, worked to leg for one"
8.1,"Narine to Mandeep, no run","flighted outside off, pushed to cover"
7.6,"Varun to Rahul, OUT","given out lbw, and Rahul is not using the review. And I think this is missing leg, but I will wait for the replays to prove me wrong. Looks like the skiddy wrong'un from around off, and the sharp quick turn beats him. Umpire Illingworth raises the finger, but the question is: is it turning too much? We will have to wait for the end of the timeout for the answer. Umpire's call on the leg stump"
7.5,"Varun to Rahul, no run","on a length, outside off, this time the cut goes straight to point"
7.4,"Varun to Rahul, FOUR runs","too short, wide, and he goes back to cut it square of deep cover. Delays the cut to get this placement"
7.3,"Varun to Rahul, no run","short of a length, quicker, punched down the ground, but not wide enough of Varun to his right"
7.2,"Varun to Mandeep, 1 run","legcutter, driven in the air, just to the left of Varun, who is not quick enough to thrust a hand out"
7.1,"Varun to Rahul, 1 run","on a length, around off, goes with the angle. Pushed to leg for one"
6.6,"Narine to Rahul, 1 run",another away-swinger. Looks like that knuckle-ball seam-up floater. Gets a bottom edge on it. Single to short third man
6.5,"Narine to Rahul, 2 runs","offbreak, middle and leg, pushed deep into the leg side for two"
6.4,"Narine to Mandeep, 1 run","short of a length, pulled into the leg side"
6.3,"Narine to Mandeep, no run",yes this is swing and not turn. Again it dips and swings. Pushed to short cover. It is a carrom ball bowled with the seam up
6.2,"Narine to Rahul, 1 run","slight swing away from Rahul, driven to deep cover. Seam-up this time. Perhaps the last one was too"
6.1,"Narine to Rahul, no run","carrom ball, outside off, beats his cut"
5.6,"Varun to Rahul, 1 run","wrong'un, on a length, into the pads, pushed wide of mid-on for one"
5.5,"Varun to Rahul, no run","on a length, outside off, hit off the toe end to cover-point"
5.4,"Varun to Mandeep, 1 run","full and straight, pushed down to long-on for one"
5.3,"Varun to Mandeep, no run","quicker, fuller, on off, pushed to short cover again"
5.2,"Varun to Mandeep, no run","on a length, just outside off, Singh goes deep to punch this to short cover"
5.1,"Varun to Mandeep, no run","legcutter, on a length, punched to cover-point"
4.6,"Cummins to Rahul, no run","slower ball, on a length, outside off, punched to backward point"
4.5,"Cummins to Mandeep, 1 run","short of a length, short-arm pull to deep square for one"
4.4,"Cummins to Mandeep, FOUR runs","on a length, straight, and he swipes across its line. Not a clean hit but clears midwicket in the circle, and that is all you need in the first six overs"
4.3,"Cummins to Mandeep, 2 runs","Has Tripathi manufactured a run-out here? Singh has got back in by a frame. Pushes this short-of-a-length ball to deep point, Tripathi charges at it from deep cover, picks up one-handed and throws in the same motion. Singh is struggling, but he just about makes it"
4.2,"Cummins to Mandeep, no run","low full toss, around leg, dug out to short cover"
4.1,"Cummins to Mandeep, SIX runs","Mandeep gets going. He is waiting for this length. Short of a length, around off, and he stays in the crease to pull this over midwicket"
3.6,"Prasidh to Mandeep, 1 run","on a length, outside off, pushed wide of mid-off for one"
3.5,"Prasidh to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, dropped towards point for one"
3.4,"Prasidh to Rahul, no run","extra bounce. Rahul shuffles across early, and then backs away. Kirshna goes short of a length, and the loopy bounce beats him cut"
3.3,"Prasidh to Rahul, no run","short of a length, straight, runs off the thick outside edge to point"
3.2,"Prasidh to Rahul, FOUR runs","low full toss, 143ks, on off. Knocking practice. Drives this straight of mid-off for four"
3.1,"Prasidh to Rahul, FOUR runs","Rahul takes charge. Stays back to a length ball, moves to off, and lofts him over wide mid-on. Not the cleanest of strikes but enough in it to go away for four"
2.6,"Cummins to Mandeep, no run","short of a length, wide, cut straight to cover-point again"
2.5,"Cummins to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, just outside off, drops this wide of cover for one"
2.4,"Cummins to Mandeep, 1 run","tries the big swing down the line, gets too far under it, but the mis-hit clears mid-off. Just about"
2.3,"Cummins to Mandeep, no run","full, just outside off, he makes room to drive, but can't beat cover-point"
2.2,"Cummins to Mandeep, no run",looks for the pull to a wide short ball at 146ks. Well just short of a length and not a long hop. Beats the pull on the bottom edge
2.1,"Cummins to Mandeep, no run","on a length, aiming top of off. Singh defends this back to him"
1.6,"Prasidh to Rahul, 2 runs","lovely shot. All hands and strong wrists. This shortish ball gets big on him, but he goes through with the back-foot drive. To the right of cover-point. Nagarkoti's chase and dive saves two runs for KKR. Well he saves one, and casual running saves the other"
1.5,"Prasidh to Mandeep, 1 run","on a length, outside off, not much power in this drive. A single wide of mid-off"
1.4,"Prasidh to Mandeep, no run","nearly played on. He looks to open the face on this, but it jabs back a little to take the bottom edge. His feet save him from getting bowled"
1.3,"Prasidh to Mandeep, no run","wide length ball, driven on the up, but can't beat cover-point"
1.2,"Prasidh to Mandeep, no run","short of a length, 141ks, outside off, pushed to cover"
1.1,"Prasidh to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, straight, punched wide of mid-on for one"
0.6,"Cummins to Mandeep, no run","length ball, outside off, hits him high on the bat as Singh defends"
0.5,"Cummins to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, at off, runs off the thick edge to third man for one"
0.4,"Cummins to Rahul, no run","short of a length, outside off, punched to point"
0.3,"Cummins to Rahul, no run",beaten on the outside edge This length ball seams away despite a wobbly seam
0.2,"Cummins to Rahul, no run","full, just outside off, pushed to mid-off"
0.1,"Cummins to Rahul, FOUR runs","some excitement first ball, but it fizzles out soon. Rahul has steered this to third man. It nearly carries all the way, but then Krishna lets it slide through his legs"
19.6,"Jordan to Prasidh, no run","beats him with a yorker, but it does my head in why they don't try to run the bye. Really strange they won't keep running till they are run out"
19.5,"Jordan to Varun, OUT",looks to ramp it instead of looking to take the single to hand over the strike to Ferguson. Jordan beats him and uproots the leg stump
19.4,"Jordan to Ferguson, 1 run","full and straight, doesn't let him get under it, driven to long-on just for the one"
19.3,"Jordan to Varun, 1 run","really full again, dug out wide of long-on, but they take just the one"
19.2,"Jordan to Varun, 2 leg byes","length ball, angling in, cramping him up for room. Varun gets two leg-byes fine of fine leg"
19.1,"Jordan to Ferguson, 1 run",gets the yorker almost right. No way Ferguson is getting under the low full toss. Just the single to long-off
18.6,"Shami to Ferguson, 1 leg bye","short of a length, into the ribs, they get a leg-bye"
18.5,"Shami to Ferguson, SIX runs","Ferguson sends a question mark to Gill. Why did you deny me the strike? Makes room, and takes this full ball and sends it over extra cover for a six"
18.4,"Shami to Varun, 1 run","full toss, middle and leg, pushed towards wide mid-off for one"
18.3,"Shami to Gill, OUT","low full toss, right in the hitting slot, but he hits this straight to deep midwicket. Just a chip instead of a full-blooded slog. Perhaps Shami denied him any slogging room by following him"
18.2,"Shami to Gill, no run","makes room, Shami follows him with a full and straight delivery. He hits this straight to long-on, and turns down the single"
18.1,"Shami to Ferguson, 1 run","oh right in the sweet hitting slot, but Ferguson doesn't get all of it. Just the single to long-on"
17.6,"Jordan to Ferguson, 1 run","low full toss again, down the leg side, dug out to deep midwicket for one. They have missed out on three straight full tosses"
17.5,"Jordan to Gill, 1 run","another low full toss, and he ends up hitting this straight to deep backward square leg for one"
17.4,"Jordan to Gill, no run","full toss, hits his pad, on the full, Jordan appeals big time, but this is headed down leg. Gill has just moved too far across to take toll of this full toss"
17.3,"Jordan to Ferguson, 1 run","yorker almost, middle and leg, dug out down to long-on for one"
17.2,"Jordan to Ferguson, FOUR runs","short, wide, on-pace, and he flays at it. Upper-cuts it over point for four more"
17.1,"Jordan to Ferguson, FOUR runs","this ball is relief. Full, outside off, with mid-off up. And on-pace. Driven wide of mid-off and along the ground"
16.6,"Ashwin to Gill, FOUR runs","classy shot. Ashwin stays wide with his legbreak,s but pitches this up this time, and he is down on his back knee to loft thim over extra cover"
16.5,"Ashwin to Ferguson, 1 run","full, on the pads, clipped away to deep midwicket"
16.4,"Ashwin to Ferguson, FOUR runs","wrong'un, quick and on a length, so Ferguson opens the face late to guide this past slip for four"
16.3,"Ashwin to Gill, 1 run","another wide legbreak, and there is some turn on it. Mis-hit straight of cover, and he will take the one now"
16.2,"Ashwin to Gill, no run",looks for the reverse sweep to this wide legbreak. Beaten
16.1,"Ashwin to Gill, no run","wide legbreak, punched straight to extra cover"
15.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Ferguson, no run","sweeps this from well outside off, and Gill has now turned down the single. He wants strike at the start of the next over"
15.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Ferguson, no run","down the wicket first ball, Bishnoi bowls a wide legbreak, and he is lucky to get a bit of an inside edge"
15.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Cummins, OUT","this is a straighter wrong'un, and he gets his man. Cummins wants to review, but they don't have a review left. This googly starts just outside off, and it is closer than the last one, but it is still headed down leg"
15.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Cummins, no run","another wrong'un, beats him comprehensively this time, but this is sliding down leg. Not given. But he has convinced his captain to go for the review. Replays show it is missing leg"
15.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Cummins, no run","wrong'un this time, worked to leg"
15.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Cummins, no run","short of a length, outside off, he plays for the turn, gets an inside edge onto the pad"
14.6,"Ashwin to Cummins, 1 run","wrong'un, from outside off, he gets an inside edge on it for one"
14.5,"Ashwin to Cummins, no run",another tentative push back to him
14.4,"Ashwin to Cummins, no run","flighted just outside off, defended"
14.3,"Ashwin to Cummins, no run","quick, flat legbreak, Cummins is tentative as he pushes at it from deep inside the crease. Just gets an outside edge, past slip"
14.2,"Ashwin to Nagarkoti,, OUT","that ends a tortured stay for Nagarkoti. And it is torture when you are not picking legspinners. Misses another wrong'un as he looks for a big cover drive, and this turns back enough to hit the wicket"
14.1,"Ashwin to Nagarkoti,, no run","full, slow, just outside off, thick edge back to him"
13.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, no run","full, outside off, driven to extra cover"
13.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 2 runs","flat, into the pads, placed wide of deep midwicket. That is a fifty for Gill. Good to seem him back with form and intent"
13.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Nagarkoti,, 1 run",chipped back over his head. Unconvincing shot again
13.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Nagarkoti,, 2 runs","slow, full, down leg, runs off the inside half of the bat fine on the leg side for a couple"
13.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 1 run","on a length, on off, turns away, punched to deep cover for one"
13.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, no run","legbreak, just outside off, punched straight to extra cover"
12.6,"Ashwin to Nagarkoti,, no run","fails to pick the googly again. It can get really difficult if you are not picking it from the hand. Looking for a big booming drive, and then gets a thick inside edge to short fine leg"
12.5,"Ashwin to Gill, 1 run","short, slow, Gill won't get any timing into this. Just the single to long-on"
12.4,"Ashwin to Nagarkoti,, 1 run",this one has sat in the surface. Nagarkoti aborts his cut and ends up checking his shot. Just clears cover-point
12.3,"Ashwin to Nagarkoti,, no run","doesn't read the googly again, this one starts from within the stumps and hits him on the pad. Going down leg, though"
12.2,"Ashwin to Nagarkoti,, no run","wide wrong'un, comes back in a long way, he dabs on it, but can't clear slip"
12.1,"Ashwin to Nagarkoti,, no run","some turn for this legbreak, hit back to him"
11.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Nagarkoti,, 1 run","wrong'un, he picks it, works it into the leg side for a single"
11.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 1 run","legbreak, middle and off, turning away, pushed to long-on for one"
11.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Nagarkoti,, 1 run",pushed to deep cover for one as he gets too full
11.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Nagarkoti,, no run","another wrong'un, and this time he picks it and defends it off the front foot"
11.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Nagarkoti,, no run","wrong'un outside off, and he has not picked it. The inside edge hits the pad"
11.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 1 run","flat, length ball, punched to wide long-off"
10.6,"Jordan to Narine, OUT","slower ball, and Narine has dragged this on. Wide off cutter, on a length, Narine is looking to go over cover with his drive, but gets the toe-end of the bat onto his wicket"
10.6,"Jordan to Narine, 1 wide","shorter, higher, wide"
10.5,"Jordan to Narine, FOUR runs","cheeky. Jordan goes short and at his body, but he ramps this over the keeper's head. Just arches a little to make the room"
10.4,"Jordan to Narine, no run","short of a length, outside off, punched to point"
10.3,"Jordan to Narine, 2 runs","gets away with this. Short of a length, into the body, handcuffs him with the angle. Narine throws his bat at it, and manages to clear midwicket with this aerial hit"
10.3,"Jordan to Narine, 1 wide","looks to dig it in short, but gets it only rib high. And also down leg"
10.2,"Jordan to Gill, 1 run","slower ball, short, wide, cut away for one"
10.1,"Jordan to Gill, no run","yorker, outside off, beats him on the inside edge"
9.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 1 run","short, wide, cut away to deep point for one"
9.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Morgan, OUT","Bushnoi strikes. Wrong'un outside leg, Morgan goes for the aerial sweep, just that degree of spin means the connection is not the sweetest, and even on these short boundaries, that results in a catch at deep backward square leg"
9.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 1 run","flatter, on a length, punched to long-off for one"
9.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, SIX runs","Gill just keeps clearing long-on. This is not a half-volley. Bishnoi has bowled a legbreak on length, but his reach means he can access it and go over long-on"
9.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Morgan, 1 run","slow in the air, outside off, swept along the ground to deep midwicket for one"
9.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 1 run","down the wicket first up, ends up dragging this to long-on for one. No turn on the ball"
8.6,"Jordan to Morgan, no run","Morgan is looking to get outside the line of off and access the leg side, but ends up playing a cover drive to this length ball. Straight to extra cover. Just the respite KXIP needed"
8.5,"Jordan to Morgan, no run","short of a length, widish, out of his reach, and quick. Beaten"
8.4,"Jordan to Gill, 1 run","slower ball, short, outside off, pulled down to long-on for one"
8.3,"Jordan to Gill, no run","wide and full, he drives at it, gets a bottom edge through to the keeper. Along the ground"
8.2,"Jordan to Gill, no run","short, wide, he looks to cut, but his back foot is stuck on the leg stump. Beaten on the cut"
8.1,"Jordan to Morgan, 1 run","Morgan is looking to charge him, and Jordan starts off with a slower ball to keep him in check. Punched to deep point"
7.6,"Ashwin to Gill, SIX runs","slog sweep. With the spin, against the spin, it doesn't matter. They are not letting the spinners bowl. Reminiscent of the Samson-Smith assault against CSK. Down on a knee to send this over wide long-on"
7.5,"Ashwin to Gill, no run","full, middle and off, dragged to short midwicket"
7.4,"Ashwin to Morgan, 1 run","slider, short, wide, cut away for one to deep point"
7.3,"Ashwin to Morgan, SIX runs",Morgan is in some mood. He is taking these short boundaries on and succeeding. This is not off the middle of the bat but has cleared long-on with ease. He skips down and just goes through it with full conviction even though he is not to the pitch of the ball
7.2,"Ashwin to Morgan, no run","flighted outside off, pushed back to the right of Ashwin"
7.1,"Ashwin to Gill, 1 run","on a length, on off, some turn, punched down to long-off for one"
6.6,"Maxwell to Morgan, SIX runs","flat low six. Maxwell bowls only slightly short, but that is enough for these small boundaries. Morgan goes over deep backward square leg. It is a skimmer"
6.5,"Maxwell to Morgan, no run","slow in the air, on a length, some turn, pushed to extra cover"
6.4,"Maxwell to Gill, 1 run","on a length, middle and off, punched down to long-on for one"
6.3,"Maxwell to Morgan, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, punched to deep midwicket"
6.2,"Maxwell to Morgan, FOUR runs","excellent batting. Top shot. Makes room, takes this from way outside leg, and drives him over extra cover for four"
6.1,"Maxwell to Morgan, no run","on a length, just outside off, pushed to cover"
5.6,"Shami to Gill, SIX runs","this is into the road. This is T20. Who cares if you have lost three early wickets? You still have seven over the next 17 overs. Shami bowls a half-volley on the pads, and he languidly clips this over wide long-on. LOvely to watch"
5.5,"Shami to Gill, SIX runs","lovely shot. Gill seemed to have turned a corner last game the way he struck the ball, and now he is showing more of it. High-arm on-the-up punch to a length ball, all the way over long-on"
5.4,"Shami to Morgan, 1 run","down the wicket, gets too close to the pitch of this ball, but sneaks in a single to mid-off"
5.3,"Shami to Morgan, FOUR runs","short of a length, no room, Morgan plays a bit of a late-cut, guiding this wide of point, using Shami's pace"
5.2,"Shami to Morgan, no run","looks to hook this bouncer, but is beaten. Looks really high to me but not called a wide"
5.1,"Shami to Morgan, FOUR runs","Morgan continues to punch back. Skips down the wicket again, turns this into a length ball and goes over mid-on"
4.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, no run","on a length, angling in, hits the inside half of the bat as he drives"
4.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, FOUR runs","that is dismissive. He skips down the wicket, Arshdeep digs this in short, and he pulls this through square leg. Rolls his wrists on this"
4.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Morgan, 1 run","angling in, Morgan stands his ground and flicks this to deep square for one"
4.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Morgan, FOUR runs","Morgan keeps charging at him, Arshdeep bowls a wide length ball, and he gets a thick outside edge well fine of third man who is placed square"
4.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, 1 run","again extra bounce from just short of a length, but he gets a single to mid-off this time"
4.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, no run","short of a length, outside off, he punches this on top of the bounce. Straight to point"
3.6,"Shami to Morgan, no run","down the wicket, creates a bit of a driving length, but ends up toe-ending this to cover-point"
3.5,"Shami to Morgan, no run","cramps him up with this shortish ball, punched straight to point this time"
3.4,"Shami to Morgan, FOUR runs","short of a length, not too wide, but he upper-cuts this over point. This one travels. Just one bounce into the fence"
3.3,"Shami to Gill, 1 run","on a length, angling into the pads, clipped away for a single to deep square leg"
3.2,"Shami to Gill, no run","half-volley on the pads, beats his attempt to flick this away. Missed out on runs here"
3.1,"Shami to Gill, no run","on a length, just outside off. Defended"
2.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Morgan, 2 runs","down the wicket, slightly early into the shot but clears midwicket with a swipe"
2.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Morgan, no run","slight shimmy down the wicket, defends this length ball outside off"
2.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Morgan, no run","length ball outside off, left alone as it holds its line"
2.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, runs this down to third man"
2.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, 1 wide","wide length ball, too wide"
2.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, no run","on a length, outside off, left alone"
2.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, FOUR runs","full, on the pads, clipped away square on the leg side"
1.6,"Shami to Karthik, OUT","this is even better. Too good in fact: he has been given but Karthik has reviewed it immediately. Lovely length ball, just outside off, holds its line, there is a sound as it passes his bat. Karthik contends the sound has come from his bat hitting the pad, but the Snicko shows a spike at the exact moment the ball is next to the bat. And it does also hit the pad at around the same time. So the benefit of the doubt has to go to the on-field call"
1.5,"Shami to Karthik, no run",leaves alone outside off now. It is a little Test-like
1.4,"Shami to Tripathi, OUT","Shami strikes. Test-match lines and lengths. Attacking top of off on the angle, and then leaving him after pitching. Top-quality bowling. Tripathi pushes at it with an open face, and edges it through"
1.3,"Shami to Gill, 1 run","Maxwell saves three. Push-driven on the up, straight of cover, wide of mid-off. It beats the first man, but Maxwell cuts the angle and puts in a big dive"
1.2,"Shami to Gill, no run","short of a length, skids through, hits him high on the pad after nipping in and beating his bat"
1.1,"Shami to Gill, no run","on a length, outside off, holds its line. He leaves it alone"
0.6,"Maxwell to Tripathi, no run","quicker, flatter, shorter. Defended with an open face"
0.5,"Maxwell to Tripathi, SIX runs",Tripathi takes on deep midwicket and wins. The confidence from a fresh wicket and a small ground. He slog-sweeps this just over the fence
0.4,"Maxwell to Gill, 1 run","stays on a length, on the pads, punched to wide long-on"
0.3,"Maxwell to Tripathi, 1 run","on a length, outside leg, pushed wide of short midwicket for one"
0.2,"Maxwell to Rana, OUT","Rana annihilated Ashwin the other day, but he is out first ball to a much lesser offspinner. The shot is on. This is a length ball, outside leg, both square leg and fine leg inside the circle. So the sweep is on, but all he manages is a soft top edge straight to Gayle at short fine leg"
0.1,"Maxwell to Gill, 1 run","full, outside leg, clipped to deep midwicket for one"
18.2,"Pattinson to Stokes, FOUR runs","lifts it over extra cover to seal the win. Low full toss pushed across him, reaches out and opens the face perfectly"
18.1,"Pattinson to Stokes, SIX runs","swipes it over midwicket to bring up his second IPL hundred! This is what Stokes does when he gets past 50 in the IPL - turns them into hundreds. Length ball picked up with a pristine pull shot. He's struggled to get the runs away but has been pretty close to flawless tonight. His previous century also came in chase, this is a record in the IPL"
17.6,"Boult to Samson, no run","short and wide outside off, beaten on the cut"
17.5,"Boult to Stokes, 1 run","slower short ball down leg side, pulled out to deep backward square"
17.4,"Boult to Samson, 1 run","full on the pads, flicked straight to short fine"
17.3,"Boult to Stokes, 1 run",short and just outside off. Check-pull down to long-on as that stops on him
17.2,"Boult to Stokes, no run",full and following him down leg side. Driven on the bounce to the bowler
17.1,"Boult to Samson, 1 run","low full toss outside off, driven to long-off's left"
16.6,"Bumrah to Stokes, FOUR runs","top edge over the keeper. Short and across the corridor, looks to pull along the ground and this is into the third man boundary"
16.5,"Bumrah to Stokes, no run",short and climbing across middle stump. Sways out of the way to let it go
16.4,"Bumrah to Samson, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
16.3,"Bumrah to Stokes, 1 run","slower short ball at leg stump, pulled into the square leg region"
16.2,"Bumrah to Stokes, 2 runs","good length outside off, allows that on ad chops to third man's left. Comes back for the second and puts in a slide to get into the nineties. It's sent upstairs for the run out but he was well in"
16.1,"Bumrah to Stokes, 2 runs","good length on leg stump, glanced to deep square's left"
15.6,"Boult to Stokes, 1 run","yorker into leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
15.5,"Boult to Stokes, FOUR runs",tickled fine. Yorker dipping down leg side and he helps it along off the front foot
15.4,"Boult to Stokes, 2 runs","slower ball at a length on middle stump, waits on that and nudges with soft hands to long-on's left"
15.3,"Boult to Stokes, FOUR runs",thick outside edge fine of short third man. Slower short ball rising outside off. Backs into the leg side and goes hard with the cut that he's ultimately not in control of
15.2,"Boult to Stokes, 2 runs","length and at the body, shoveled into the vacant midwicket region off the back foot"
15.1,"Boult to Stokes, 2 runs","just clears extra cover. Slower short ball outside off, waits on that for the lofted cut which comes off the toe-end. Sweeper cleans up to the left"
14.6,"Bumrah to Samson, 2 runs","short of a length outside off, allows it on and drags this to deep midwicket's left to bring up his fifty. Flexes his left bicep and gives it a pat with the bat as he acknowledges the applause from his dugout"
14.5,"Bumrah to Samson, FOUR runs",tickled fine. Attempted yorker is a low full toss heading down leg side. Stays tall and closes the face delicately on this
14.4,"Bumrah to Samson, FOUR runs","short and angled down leg side. Waits on it and caresses this with a pull, to fine leg's right. Desperate slide to the right from Pattinson after an intense sprint. Gets a hand but can't stop that rolling into the boundary"
14.3,"Bumrah to Stokes, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length and wide outside off. Cut to sweeper's right"
14.2,"Bumrah to Samson, 1 run","slower short ball just outside off, pulled to deep square"
14.1,"Bumrah to Stokes, 1 leg bye","yorker down leg side, thuds the pads as he looks to flick"
13.6,"Chahar to Samson, SIX runs","steps out and slaps it on the up over the bowler! That is an incredible shot because he's been beaten in flight but still manages to get six. It's slow and dipping at a length outside off. He's almost had to go flat-batted to clear the rope, the way you would after you step out to a fast bowler"
13.5,"Chahar to Samson, FOUR runs","chopped past point. Chahar loops this at a length, wide outside off. Usually the kind of delivery a leggie bowls when he expects the batsman to step out. Samson stays deep, gets the front foot out and gets this square drive to the fielder's left"
13.4,"Chahar to Stokes, 1 run","googly, short of a length at leg stump. Pulled to deep midwicket"
13.3,"Chahar to Stokes, SIX runs",steps out and drills it over the bowler's head. It's length and pushed through at middle stump. He's met that at the pitch and launched it off the low part of the bat
13.2,"Chahar to Samson, 1 run","full and wide outside off, loses shape as he looks to blaze this through the covers. Off the inside edge down to long-on"
13.1,"Chahar to Stokes, 1 leg bye","good length and down leg side, cops the attempted sweep on the pad"
12.6,"Pattinson to Samson, FOUR runs","deft and effective. Short and climbing in the corridor. He leaps off the ground, watches that right under his eyes and opens the face to dab this past short third man"
12.6,"Pattinson to Samson, 1 wide","slower short ball down leg side, left alone"
12.5,"Pattinson to Samson, SIX runs","a beauty from Samson! Trademark straight six against the fast bowler. It's a length ball just outside off, he's so well balanced as he swings through the line of this and lofts it over the long-off boundary. Sweet, sweet connection"
12.4,"Pattinson to Stokes, 1 run","yorker at middle stump, can't get the drive away. Single at midwicket"
12.3,"Pattinson to Stokes, no run",beaten on the ramp. Short of a length and climbing above middle stump as he drops into the off side
12.2,"Pattinson to Stokes, 2 runs","low full toss outside off, hangs deep and drills this to long-off's left. Pollard does superbly to sprint across and slide to his left, but even better to stop himself from sliding into the boundary padding"
12.1,"Pattinson to Stokes, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, reaches out and slaps it on the up to extra cover's left"
11.6,"Chahar to Samson, no run","good length at middle stump, gets low for the ramp but is through it early. Looks like that hit the glove, after coming off the cue-end"
11.5,"Chahar to Stokes, 1 run","diagonal run up again. Googly at a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
11.4,"Chahar to Stokes, no run",beaten on the cut. Chahar goes to the diagonal run up between umpire and stumps. He's still over the wicket. Short of a length and climbing away from him
11.3,"Chahar to Samson, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punched to deep extra cover off the back foot"
11.2,"Chahar to Stokes, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punched to long-on off the back foot"
11.1,"Chahar to Stokes, no run","slides through under the bat. Googly, short of a length and spinning across the corridor as he looks to pull this over deep midwicket"
10.6,"Bumrah to Stokes, 1 leg bye",appeal for lbw turned down.
10.5,"Bumrah to Stokes, no run","full and just outside off, misitimed drive to extra cover"
10.4,"Bumrah to Samson, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, flicked to deep square"
10.3,"Bumrah to Stokes, 1 run",short of a length slower ball outside off. Chopped to sweeper cover
10.2,"Bumrah to Samson, 1 run","good length and into the body, tapped past the non-striker off the back foot"
10.2,"Bumrah to Samson, 1 wide",short and well down leg side. QDK leaps a long way to his left to gather
10.1,"Bumrah to Samson, no run","slower short ball just outside off, backs away and finds point with a well-timed cut"
9.6,"Krunal to Stokes, FOUR runs","short of a length and into leg stump, swiped with the turn and there's a mix-up between deep square and deep midwicket as they converge. Neither is sure which one has to sprint at this. In the end it's into the boundary and that is Stokes' first fifty of the season and it's come off 28 balls"
9.5,"Krunal to Stokes, FOUR runs","low full toss on leg stump, clears the front leg and pumps it between non-striker and stumps. Too quick for long-on to his right"
9.4,"Krunal to Samson, 1 run","yorker at leg stump, squeezed out to deep extra cover's right"
9.3,"Krunal to Stokes, 1 bye","another yorker, just inside the tramline. Left alone again. QDK can't gather cleanly"
9.2,"Krunal to Stokes, no run","fires a yorker ust inside the tramline, left alone"
9.1,"Krunal to Samson, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched on the up to extra cover"
8.6,"Pollard to Samson, 1 run","good length cutter outside off, clipped to deep midwicket off the front foot"
8.6,"Pollard to Samson, 1 wide","full slower ball, spins down leg side. Left alone"
8.5,"Pollard to Stokes, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, punched to long-off"
8.5,"Pollard to Stokes, 1 wide","full slower ball, down leg side. Rolls out to the keeper"
8.4,"Pollard to Stokes, no run","lbw appeal is turned down as Stokes gets in a tangle attempting the reverse sweep. It's a length ball from around the wicket, it's come off the glove"
8.3,"Pollard to Samson, 1 run","slower ball at a length outside off, gets a little too much bat for a second on this pat to long-on's right"
8.2,"Pollard to Samson, 2 runs","slower ball at a length on middle stump, leans in and tucks it to long-on's right"
8.1,"Pollard to Samson, SIX runs","launched over long-off! Sweet as ever. It's overpitched outside off, he hangs back to open up the exact spot he's hit it in. A clean swing with the straight bat offered"
7.6,"Chahar to Samson, 1 run","good length at middle stump, a bit late on the slog sweep. It dribbes out to deep midwicket"
7.5,"Chahar to Stokes, 1 run",good length and just outside off. Punched to extra cover's left off the back foot
7.4,"Chahar to Samson, 1 run","tossed up outside off, mistimed drive to long-on"
7.3,"Chahar to Stokes, 1 run","dropped short outside off, punched to long-off from the back foot"
7.2,"Chahar to Stokes, FOUR runs","reverse sweep past backward point. And rapidly too. Picks this full one from outside leg, is almost arching by the end of that to get it in front of his pad. The fielder can barely get a hand out to his left"
7.1,"Chahar to Stokes, SIX runs","gets the slog sweep over deep midwicket. His first six of the season. This is a length ball, pushed flat at middle stump. Gets on one knee and swings cleanly across it"
7.1,"Chahar to Stokes, 1 wide","full and down leg side, beaten on the sweep"
6.6,"Pollard to Samson, no run",short and wide slower ball outside off. Stabbed to backward point
6.5,"Pollard to Stokes, 1 run","slower ball, skidding on outside off. Short of a length. Subdued pull to long-on's left"
6.5,"Pollard to Stokes, 1 wide",beaten as he runs down at this. Short and wide and past the tramline
6.4,"Pollard to Samson, 1 run","good length and just outside off, a languid punch down to long-off"
6.3,"Pollard to Stokes, 1 run","full and wide outside off, driven along the ground to sweeper cover"
6.2,"Pollard to Stokes, no run","slower ball, short of a length and past the outside edge as he looks to steer to third man"
6.1,"Pollard to Samson, 1 run","full slower ball outside off, leans in and flicks through midwicket"
5.6,"Krunal to Stokes, FOUR runs","just out of Hardik's reach at deep midwicket. A difficult one but a drop nonetheless, because he had made the ground. Good length ball at middle stump, slices the attempted slog sweep. Hardik runs backwards and to his right, but can't get his hands on it as he lunges. It bounces well inside the line and trickles into the boundary. Looks it like it curved away from him at the end"
5.5,"Krunal to Stokes, FOUR runs",finally threads one. Full and tossed up at off stump. Gets down on the back knee and gets the reverse sweep square of short third man
5.4,"Krunal to Stokes, no run","low full toss wide outside off, slashed straight to cover"
5.3,"Krunal to Stokes, no run","full on leg stump, backs into the leg side for room and drives straight to extra cover"
5.2,"Krunal to Stokes, no run",beaten on the reverse sweep. That was full and across his off stump
5.1,"Krunal to Stokes, 2 runs","good length at leg stump, flicked out to deep midwicket"
4.6,"Pattinson to Samson, no run",good length and at middle stump. Defended to mid-on off the back foot
4.6,"Pattinson to Samson, 1 wide","bouncer down leg side, left alone"
4.5,"Pattinson to Samson, no run",short at leg stump. Awkwardly fended into the leg side. Stokes goes halfway down and then back as Samson refuses the run
4.4,"Pattinson to Smith, OUT",inside edge and onto leg stump! That's a good delivery from Pattinson. Gets it to jag back in off a good length from outside off. Smith is looking to force it through the covers for the initial line and the movement is enough for the ball to take the inside edge. Leg stump if out of the gorund
4.3,"Pattinson to Smith, no run",beaten as he looks for the ramp. Short of a length and climbing over leg stump as Smith steps into the off side
4.2,"Pattinson to Stokes, 1 run",slower full ball at off stump. Front leg out of the way as he check-punches to mid-off
4.1,"Pattinson to Stokes, 2 runs","just clears mid-on. Good length at leg stump, gets big on him as he offers the full face and looks to loft it on the rise"
3.6,"Bumrah to Smith, no run","short of a length and just outside off, beaten on the chop"
3.5,"Bumrah to Smith, SIX runs","hoicked over the square leg boundary! Hangs deep in the crease, waits for the length ball angled into him. Then swishes from from under that, a complete closing of the bat's face. To the point that the bat face is facing the bowler after a full rotation after he completes this shot"
3.4,"Bumrah to Stokes, 1 run","short and going across him. Looks like he wanted to pull that initially, but followed it with his hands. Got decent timing on the push through the off side, but point tumbles to the left and stops"
3.3,"Bumrah to Smith, 1 run",good length and cramped at middle and off. Hurriedly stabs to mid-on
3.2,"Bumrah to Smith, no run","good length and in at off stump, defended off the front foot"
3.1,"Bumrah to Smith, FOUR runs","oh lovely timing! Good length and slanted into the corridor. Forces this drive off the back foot and gets it to Pollard's left at mid-off. He gives chase, puts in the slide and pulls it in. It keeps rolling towards the line with the momentum though and on his second attempt to keep it in, he touches the boundary padding"
2.6,"Boult to Stokes, FOUR runs",sliced past extra cover! Walking into the leg side again. Boult overpitches on a stumps line. Stokes has made plenty of room and drives on the rise. A little uppishly but to the fielder's right
2.5,"Boult to Stokes, FOUR runs","lofted over the bowler. Not off the middle, that sticks in the pitch a little. But it's got enough. Full ball, and the full face offered. Trickles into the padding as mid-off and mid-on give chase"
2.4,"Boult to Stokes, FOUR runs",drilled past the bowler's ankles. He walks into the leg side. Boult follows him with an attempted yorker. Stokes meets it on the full though and punches firmly
2.3,"Boult to Stokes, no run","short of a length outside off, punched into the covers"
2.2,"Boult to Stokes, FOUR runs","good length and into the pads. Walks into that, as he does, and clips it through midwicket"
2.1,"Boult to Stokes, no run","good length at leg stump, defended to mid-on"
1.6,"Pattinson to Smith, no run","short of a length outside off, nicely behind the line to defend off the back foot"
1.5,"Pattinson to Uthappa, OUT",taken at mid-on. Locked on the front foot again. This is a length ball outside off. He wants to shovel that wide of mid-on. But it's off the high part of the bat and floats gently to Pollard's left
1.4,"Pattinson to Uthappa, FOUR runs","full and just outside off, a nice stride forward as he drives elegantly to mid-off's left"
1.3,"Pattinson to Uthappa, no run",good length and cutting into the corridor. Gets forward and pats it to midwicket
1.2,"Pattinson to Uthappa, no run",good length and angled into the corridor. Punched to mid-on
1.1,"Pattinson to Uthappa, FOUR runs",lofted over midwicket. Short of a length and just outside off. He's locked on the front foot but he watches closely and lifts the pull sweetly
0.6,"Boult to Uthappa, 1 run","good length on middle stump, gets the front leg across and pats this uppushly to mid-on's right"
0.5,"Boult to Uthappa, no run",good length and tight at the stumps. Defended down the pitch
0.4,"Boult to Uthappa, no run",good length and swung into the corridor. Punched on the rise to mid-on's left
0.3,"Boult to Uthappa, no run",beaten. Good length and going across off stump as he feels for the one coming into him
0.2,"Boult to Uthappa, 2 runs","leading edge falls short of backward point and the bad bounce sneaks through him. Full and just outside off, looked for the straight drive but brought an angled bat down on that"
0.1,"Boult to Uthappa, 2 runs","good length, and an inswinger outside off. Leans in for the drive. Hard hands get him a thick inside edge to midwicket's right"
19.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandya, SIX runs","clubs this over the bowler Unreal hitting arcs on this guy. Completely intimidates the young bowler, who has bowled yet another length ball right at that back leg which is deep in the crease outside off stump. That's the slot for Pandya. And he uses his core strength to hammer it on the up from there"
19.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandya, SIX runs","brings up fifty with his sixth six. Short and wide outside off, split stance and then quick hands from under this. He doesn't time it too well but it's wide of long-off and into the boards"
19.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandya, FOUR runs","lofted over extra cover. Good length and wide outside off, the back leg is out to give him the reach and he opens the face late. It's off  the low part of the bat but it's in the gap"
19.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandya, FOUR runs","slapped to the extra cover boundary. Once again, he puts the back leg into the off side and sets up with a split stance. Tyagi goes short and wide and he chucks the hands at this and gets it over extra cover"
19.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandya, SIX runs","clears deep midwicket. Casual. Short of a length ball outside off, he gets the back leg into the off side to get in line of that and pulls it cleanly"
19.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Krunal, 1 run",full and just outside off. Attempted drive comes off the toe-end and trickles down to long-on
18.6,"Archer to Krunal, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, mistimed pull out to deep square"
18.5,"Archer to Krunal, no run","short and just outside off, gets on his toes for the upper cut but is beaten"
18.4,"Archer to Pandya, 1 run","yorker just outside off, chopped straight to point"
18.3,"Archer to Pandya, no run","full and just outside off, wants to pierce the covers with the drive but he hits this straight to extra cover. There was no sweeper"
18.2,"Archer to Krunal, 1 run","yorker at middle stump, jammed into the covers"
18.1,"Archer to Tiwary, OUT","taken at long-on. Low full toss at middle stump, wants to loft it over that fielder but it's come off the low part of the bat and is taken well inside"
17.6,"Rajpoot to Pandya, SIX runs",another full toss and it is sent over square! 27 off Rajpoot's last over. He finishes with 60 off his four. Full toss on leg stump at 133kph. Hardik merely waits and lifts
17.5,"Rajpoot to Pandya, SIX runs",pulls this over vacant fine leg. Shuffles to open up that side of the ground and Rajpoot gives him a thigh-height full toss on leg stump. He simply lifts it with the angle
17.4,"Rajpoot to Pandya, SIX runs","whipped over long-off! This is overpitched outside off, his feet are static but he gets his upper body out on top of the ball as he meets it, and then whips his wrists out at it. That is an ode to the helicopter shot"
17.3,"Rajpoot to Tiwary, 1 run","short and at the body, misses on the attempted pull"
17.2,"Rajpoot to Pandya, 1 run","full and just outside off, drilled along the floor to sweeper cover"
17.1,"Rajpoot to Pandya, SIX runs","high full toss lifted past long-on. Just. It's outside off and his attempted pull is not off the middle of the bat. It is wide of long-on though, and just to his right"
17.1,"Rajpoot to Pandya, 1 wide",yorker just past the tramline outside off
16.6,"Archer to Tiwary, SIX runs","swipes it over the long leg boundary. Lost the radar with this one too, did Jofra. Short and angled into the hips from around the wicket. Tiwary swivels and helps it along"
16.5,"Archer to Tiwary, FOUR runs","full and just outside off, clears the front leg and lifts this straight over the bowler. Jofra missed on the yorker"
16.4,"Archer to Pandya, 1 run","low full toss outside off, driven to long-off's left"
16.3,"Archer to Tiwary, 1 run","yorker at middle stump, jammed down towards long-on"
16.2,"Archer to Tiwary, FOUR runs",inside edge past short fine. He follows Tiwary down leg side and he can't get the attempted slog away
16.1,"Archer to Pandya, 1 run","legcutter, good length and in at off stump. Punched to extra cover"
15.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandya, 1 run","dropped at deep midwicket. Tewatia had that in his grasp but couldn't keep it as he went to floor. Good length ball outside off, a slog off the inside half. He caught it in front of his right shin but it popped out as he lost balance and went forward"
15.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Tiwary, 1 run",just short of fine leg. Cramps him with another bouncer. He gets bat on the hook this time but not enough for it to carry
15.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Tiwary, no run","bouncer at the front shoulder, swivels to try and hook but that's past him"
15.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandya, 1 run","low full toss at middle stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
15.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Tiwary, 1 run",good length and across him from middle stump at 135kph. Pushed into the covers off the outside half

14.6,"Gopal to Pandya, 1 run","tossed up full outside off, out to the pitch of that before driving to long-off"
14.5,"Gopal to Pandya, no run","googly at a length on middle stump, defended to midwicktet's left"
14.4,"Gopal to Tiwary, 1 run","googly, short and wide outside off. Cut to sweeper cover"

14.2,"Gopal to Tiwary, 1 run","short of a length and wide outside off, toe-ended cut to extra cover's right"
14.1,"Gopal to Tiwary, FOUR runs",hammered to sweeper's left. Dropped short and very wide outside off. Reaches out and muscles the cut

13.5,"Tewatia to Tiwary, no run","googly at middle stump, defended into the covers"
13.4,"Tewatia to Tiwary, FOUR runs",slugs it wide of deep midwicket. Good length and lobbed up slowly at leg stump. Steps out and gets it a little off the inside half of the bat. Still nearly clears the line to the fielder's right
13.3,"Tewatia to Tiwary, no run","googly at leg stump, reaches out and defends on the front foot"
13.2,"Tewatia to Pandya, 1 run","good length at leg stump, looks to stab through midwicket off the back foot and gets an outside edge to short third's left. Strange outcome, because that ball was actually coming into him"
13.1,"Tewatia to Tiwary, 1 run","low full toss on leg stump, driven to long-on's left"
12.6,"Gopal to Pollard, OUT","cuts through him and takes out the stumps! Oh that'll feel good for the bowler. It's a googly, landing on a good length outside off. Pollard is on the back foot and swishing outside the line of this as it spins past the inside edge and tonks off stump. That's the first time Pollard has been dismissed since the season opener"
12.5,"Gopal to Pollard, no run","full and just outside off, defended down the pitch"
12.4,"Gopal to Pollard, SIX runs","Stokes with the one-handed pluck attempt at long-off, but this one has a lot more venom in it. He goes with his right-hand too, but that's a bit past him when he jumps and he can only help it along. Full and wide outside off and he used his reach to drive firmly through the line"
12.3,"Gopal to Pollard, no run","good length at off stump, defended off the back foot"
12.2,"Gopal to Yadav, OUT","lofted straight to long-off. SKY is playing this loft off the back foot, because he wants to make room to go from in to out and over extra cover. But he's managed to lift this full ball from middle stump straight into Stokes' hands"
12.1,"Gopal to Tiwary, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
11.6,"Tewatia to Tiwary, 1 run","short and just outside off, punched to sweeper cover"
11.5,"Tewatia to Tiwary, no run","googly, full and just outside leg stump. Looks for the sweep and cops it on the pad"

10.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Tiwary, 1 run","short at middle stump, pulled to deep midwicket"
10.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Tiwary, no run",rapidly past the bat. A quick yorker outside off to wake him up
10.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Ishan, OUT","one-handed pluck from Jofra at third man Tyagi has his head in his hands. It's a tough one, slightly self-inflicted after he took a couple of steps in, but Archer watches it closely, jumps upwards and back to stretch and grab this one-handed. It's a short ball outside off, he looks for the upper cut and seems to have just gotten away at first glance. Not tonight. Jofra's team-mates are dumbstruck after that effort. all but Ben Stokes, who looks to the skies and cackles"
10.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Ishan, no run",inside edge onto thigh. Looks for the big slog across the line at this short and wide ball outside off
10.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Ishan, no run","full and wide outside off, looks for the drive through cover but only manages to jam it into the pitch"
10.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, 1 run","full and into the pads, flicked to deep square"
9.6,"Tewatia to Ishan, FOUR runs","helps it wide of short fine. Low full toss at leg stump, gets down on a knee and uses the pace from the quicker one to ramp it to the long leg boundary"
9.5,"Tewatia to Yadav, 1 run",short of a length and turning away from outside off. Lofted pull towards deep midwicket
9.4,"Tewatia to Ishan, 1 run","googly, short of a length on middle. Gets back and whips through square leg"
9.3,"Tewatia to Yadav, 1 run","good length and down leg side, shuffles and paddles to short fine's right"
9.2,"Tewatia to Ishan, 1 run",leading edge lands safely in the off side. Was looking to slog this googly from middle stump
9.1,"Tewatia to Ishan, 2 runs","short of a length and just outside off, gets deep and whips this to Stokes' left at long-on. Puts in a slide and parries it in for Buttler at deep midwicket to retrieve"
8.6,"Gopal to Yadav, FOUR runs","lovely loft straight over the bowler. This is full outside off, he puts in a small stride to get to the pitch and is clear about where he wants to hit that. Just a gentle raise of the bat after meeting the ball on the drive"
8.5,"Gopal to Ishan, 1 run","good length on leg, flicked to deep midwicket"
8.4,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run","dropped by sweeper. Tewatia running in. A tough chance low and in front of him. Full ball lofted, inside-out and straight in line with Tewatia at deep cover, but he had to sprint in a lot and just managed to get his palms under that as he put in a slide. Couldn't hold on"
8.3,"Gopal to Yadav, FOUR runs","sliced over point. Probably not where he intended to go, but you can't always tell with SKY. It's a length ball outside off, he steps out and goes inside-out. The bat turns in his hands but he clears point comfortably"
8.2,"Gopal to Ishan, 1 run","googly, good length and turning away wide outside off. He shuffles to open up the leg side but is forced to pull towards long-on because of the slow pace"

7.4,"Tewatia to Yadav, no run","tossed up on off stump, drives straight to extra cover"
7.3,"Tewatia to Yadav, no run",good length and sticking in the surface as he drives on the up again. Falls just short of extra cover

7.1,"Tewatia to Yadav, 2 runs","good length and just outside off, lifts it inside-out with the turn and on the rise to sweeper cover's right"

5.5,"Rajpoot to Ishan, SIX runs","slower short ball, sitting up nicely down leg side. Reaches out and slaps this over short fine. Hard enough to just clear the boundary too"

5.3,"Rajpoot to Yadav, 1 run",good length and punched to mid-on's right
5.2,"Rajpoot to Yadav, SIX runs","ramps to the long leg boundary. Mr. Reverse V. This is short of a length outside off, even moving away from him. But he reaches out and swishes his bat to lift it over the infield"

4.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Ishan, no run","short of a length and just outside off, punched firmly off the back foot to find short cover point"
4.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, 1 run","good length and just outside off, pushed out towards third man"
4.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length at middle stump, swipes across that to find deep square with a thick inside edge"
3.6,"Rajpoot to Ishan, 1 run","short at leg stump, miscued pull out to deep square"
3.5,"Rajpoot to Ishan, no run",past the edge. Short of a length at middle and off. Arches into the leg side for try and steer to third man again
3.4,"Rajpoot to Ishan, FOUR runs","expertly done. Short and angled across him. Third man is in, point is in, he opens the face and helps it between them"
3.3,"Rajpoot to Yadav, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
3.3,"Rajpoot to Yadav, 1 wide","slower ball, short of a length and down leg side. Samson gets his body behind this after diving to the left. Stokes from slip picks that up and throws at the no-striker's end where Kishan was diving after being sent back. Was safely in and there was no direct hit"
3.3,"Rajpoot to Yadav, 1 wide","good length and down leg side, 134kph, can't get bat on it"
3.2,"Rajpoot to Ishan, 1 run","good length and just outside off, defended into the covers"
3.1,"Rajpoot to Ishan, 4 leg byes",big lbw appeal. Rajpoot has swung it into the pads from over the wicket. Those are difficult to get on the review. Smith doesn't review. It was full and Kishan's head was falling over as he looked to play the flick. Tracking says it pitched outside leg
2.6,"Archer to Yadav, no run","good length and in at off stump, defended to mid-on off the front foot"
2.5,"Archer to Ishan, 1 run",good length and just outside off. Gets forward and opens the face to steer to third man
2.4,"Archer to Ishan, no run",past the left shoulder. Try pulling that. Kishan won't. Sways away from it to let it pass
2.3,"Archer to Ishan, no run",beaten on the pull. Short and across off stump. Stays lower than he expects and is past the under-edge
2.2,"Archer to Ishan, no run","good length and at leg stump. Looks for the flick and cops that on the pad and is limping before going to ground. Looks like that hit him on the side of the right knee, just where the knee roll of the pad ends"
2.1,"Archer to Ishan, no run","good length at middle stump, defended down the pitch off the back foot"
1.6,"Rajpoot to Ishan, 1 run","good length at the stumps, pushed into the leg side off the front foot"
1.5,"Rajpoot to Ishan, FOUR runs","pulled to the midwicket boundary. Short of a length and just outside off, hangs deep in the crease and swipes across the angle. Aerial for a bit but safe"
1.4,"Rajpoot to Ishan, no run","short of a length and wide outside off, looks to drive on the rise but goes too hard. Under-edge into the covers"
1.3,"Rajpoot to Ishan, no run","good length and just outside off, defended on the back foot"
1.2,"Rajpoot to Ishan, FOUR runs","inside edge is past the keeper. Short of a length and across him. Angled bat from Kishan too as he looks to go square. It comes on slower than he expects. Misses off stump comfortably, and then Buttler's Samson's right hand"
1.2,"Rajpoot to Ishan, 1 wide","length and curving down leg side, past the flick"
1.1,"Rajpoot to Ishan, no run","full inswinger just outside off, leans in to that and defends into the covers"
0.6,"Archer to Yadav, 2 runs","good length and just outside off, hard-handed push on the front foot. Thick inside edge runs to fine leg's left"
0.6,"Archer to Yadav, 1 wide","short and down leg side, beaten on the attempted pull"
0.5,"Archer to de Kock, OUT","chopped on! Jofra delivers, almost every time. Good length and swung away outside off. Stays still and reaches out with an angled bat, trying to stab that towards third man. It's a big inside edge onto stumps"
0.4,"Archer to de Kock, SIX runs","slapped over square leg. He's in terrific form to be pulling Jofra for six from just short of a good length. No movement on that, he drops his back shoulder to get the weight back and uses the pace to launch this"
0.3,"Archer to de Kock, no run",
0.2,"Archer to de Kock, no run","good length on leg stump, defended into the leg side off the back foot"
0.1,"Archer to Ishan, 1 run",edge is past second slip. Short of a length and swung away from middle stump. He follows with his hands and ends up steering to third man's right
18.4,"Morris to Gaikwad, SIX runs","sealed with a six. Pace on the ball, short into the body, and he plays the pick-up pull over long leg"
18.3,"Morris to Gaikwad, no run","low full toss, dug out to short cover"
18.2,"Morris to Gaikwad, FOUR runs","on a length, on-pace, the story of RCB'a defence. Gaikwad picks it up over midwicket for four more"
18.1,"Morris to Gaikwad, no run","on a length, just outside off, inside edge onto the boot"
17.6,"Saini to Dhoni, no run","nearly a yorker, 144ks, Dhoni pushes this back to him"
17.5,"Saini to Dhoni, no run","low full toss, hit down the ground and along the ground and straight to mid-off"
17.4,"Saini to Dhoni, no run","on a length, just outside off, pushed to cover"
17.3,"Saini to Dhoni, no run","slower ball, short of a length, wide, cut hard to backward point"
17.2,"Saini to Dhoni, no run","on a length, outside off, looks to punch this hard but doesn't get any power into this"
17.1,"Saini to Dhoni, FOUR runs","Dhoni will not take this deep. On-pace length ball with mid-off up, and he picks his spot. Goes over wide mid-off for four"
16.6,"Chahal to Dhoni, 1 run","Dhoni wants to hit an early six, leaves the crease, but is done in in the air, and ends up with just the single to long-on"
16.5,"Chahal to Dhoni, no run","on a length, Dhoni rocks back, punches this hard but straight to extra cover"
16.4,"Chahal to Gaikwad, 1 run","low full toss, driven to long-on for one"
16.3,"Chahal to Dhoni, 1 run","full again, drilled to long-off for one"
16.2,"Chahal to Gaikwad, 1 run","slow, high, dipping, driven nicely to long-off for one"
16.1,"Chahal to Dhoni, 1 leg bye","slow, full, drifting in. Leg-bye as Dhoni misses with his attempted nurdle"
15.6,"Saini to Dhoni, 1 run","short and wide, lucky to get away with it as Dhoni has cut this straight to deep cover"
15.5,"Saini to Dhoni, no run","full, straight, 145ks, swinging in, pushed to short midwicket"
15.4,"Saini to Gaikwad, 1 run","on a length, angling in, pushed past midwicket for one"
15.3,"Saini to Dhoni, 1 run","full and straight, pushed to long-on for one"
15.2,"Saini to Dhoni, no run","full, 145ks, just outside off, punched to mid-off"
15.1,"Saini to Gaikwad, 1 run","wide length ball, driven on the up to deep cover. Pace on again"
14.6,"Morris to Dhoni, FOUR runs","short again, on-pace again, 143s. Dhoni pulls him handsomely again. And there is no deep square leg in place"
14.5,"Morris to Dhoni, FOUR runs","they all know he likes the bouncer. It is the one in the ribs that causes his trouble. Not a chest-high short ball outside off, and pulls this square of that long leg. Again an on-pace delivery"
14.4,"Morris to Dhoni, no run","on a length, middle and leg, some late swing to beat his attempt to work it to leg"
14.3,"Morris to Gaikwad, 1 run","quick length ball, into the pads, worked away for a single"
14.3,"Morris to Gaikwad, 1 wide","short again, and a wide down the leg side"
14.2,"Morris to Dhoni, 1 run","short ball, 140ks, he pulls this hard but can't beat long leg"
14.1,"Morris to Dhoni, no run","on a length, cramping him up, pushed back to him"
13.6,"Chahal to Dhoni, 1 run","too full again, driven down to long-on for another single"
13.5,"Chahal to Gaikwad, 1 run","full, really full, driven to long-off for one. Brings up his maiden IPL fifty"
13.4,"Chahal to Dhoni, 1 run","on a length, sliding down, worked behind square for one"
13.3,"Chahal to Rayudu, OUT",big shriek of a YES from Kohli as Rayudu sweeps all around a full legbreak. He is bowled neck and crop. The off stump gone. Chahal comes back and creates a chance. Who would have thought?
13.2,"Chahal to Gaikwad, 1 run","legbreak, on a length, goes back to punch this to deep cover"
13.1,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run",cuts away a length ball for a single
12.6,"Sundar to Gaikwad, 2 runs","on a length, middle and leg, bunted into the leg side for two"

12.2,"Sundar to Rayudu, 1 run","full, outside leg, worked to deep midwicket for one"
12.1,"Sundar to Gaikwad, 1 run","slight shimmy, then wegiht transfer back to a flat delivery. Punches this down to long-on"
11.6,"Siraj to Rayudu, SIX runs","Rayudu creates all the momentum and timing with his charge down the wicket. And even though Siraj has slowed this down to 127ks, he times it perfectly for a six over long-on. Turns this into a length ball with his charged down the wicket"
11.5,"Siraj to Rayudu, no run","short of a length, straight, pulled down the ground but not past the short straight midwicket"
11.4,"Siraj to Rayudu, 2 runs","slower bouncer creates an opportunity. Who would have thought it? The top edge doesn't carry to deep square leg, though"
11.3,"Siraj to Gaikwad, 1 run","oh sweet god, finally we see a slower ball, worked to leg for one"
11.2,"Siraj to Gaikwad, FOUR runs",half-volley at 140ks. RCB bowlers infuriating here. Haven't they watched how CSk bowled? Gaikwad accepts the gift with thanks and pushes this wide of mid-off for four
11.1,"Siraj to Rayudu, 1 run","on a length, on off, 140ks, worked to leg for one"
10.6,"Sundar to Rayudu, 1 run","on a length, angling towards off, worked behind square on the leg side for one"
10.5,"Sundar to Gaikwad, 1 run","down the wicket, not to its pitch, but pushes it past cover for another single"
10.4,"Sundar to Rayudu, 1 run","short, and it turns to defeat his pull. Bottom edge to short fine for a single"
10.3,"Sundar to Gaikwad, 1 run","on a length, straight, driven down to long-on for one"
10.2,"Sundar to Rayudu, 1 run","on the pads, on a length, worked around the corner for one"
10.1,"Sundar to Rayudu, FOUR runs","nails a sweep first ball. Down on a knee early, takes a length ball and sweeps it over square leg"
9.6,"Saini to Rayudu, 1 run","full and straight, 146ks, driven down to long-on"
9.5,"Saini to Rayudu, FOUR runs","pace on the ball again. Rayudu skips down the wicket. Saini goes short of a length and wide at 140ks. Rayudu of course loves the pace, and goes up and over point"
9.4,"Saini to Rayudu, no run","on a length, 146ks this time, defended back to him"
9.3,"Saini to Rayudu, SIX runs","pace on the ball. Short, wide, 144ks. Rayudu loves it. Upper-cuts it for a six"
9.2,"Saini to Rayudu, no run","on a length, 144ks, just outside off, defended off the back foot"
9.1,"Saini to Rayudu, no run","on a length, just outside off, Rayudu gets a thick inside edge even as he looks to drive past cover"
8.6,"Ali to Rayudu, 1 run","on a length, outside off, he goes back to open the face for a single to short third man"
8.5,"Ali to Rayudu, no run","flighted, on off, driven back to him"
8.4,"Ali to Rayudu, FOUR runs","excellent bowling but Rayudu gets away with it. No slip in place. He has got lovely dip on this, Rayudu is playing for the offbreak, but it goes straight on and takes the outside edge for four"
8.3,"Ali to Gaikwad, 1 run","flighted outside off, driven to deep cover for one"
8.2,"Ali to Gaikwad, no run","quicker, on a length, turning in, defended"
8.1,"Ali to Gaikwad, SIX runs","top shot. Gaikwad in the zone here. Skips down the wicket, gets close to this ball, and goes against the turn to clear long-off. Timing. Something RCB batsmen struggled for"
7.6,"Chahal to Gaikwad, 1 run","p[itched up slightly, driven to deep cover for one"
7.5,"Chahal to Gaikwad, no run",looks for the late cut but this slow legbreak beats him just outside off
7.4,"Chahal to Gaikwad, FOUR runs","lovely sweep. On a length, middle and leg, and he sweeps down on it, and between long leg and deep midwicket"
7.3,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run","slower in the air, just outside off, swept to deep square leg"
7.2,"Chahal to Rayudu, no run","down the wicket, beaten in the flight, there is appeal for pad first, but this is turning too much. Not given"
7.1,"Chahal to Rayudu, no run","quick, length ball, a lebgreak. Defended with an open face"
6.6,"Ali to Rayudu, 1 run","full, middle and leg, driven to long-on for one"
6.5,"Ali to Gaikwad, 1 run","nice flight and drift, he covers it and drives this to long-on for one"
6.4,"Ali to Gaikwad, no run","full, outside off, pushed to short cover"
6.3,"Ali to Rayudu, 1 run","sweep from outside off, gets a single to deep backward square"
6.2,"Ali to Gaikwad, 1 run",dip and then turn. Hit uppishy back to Moeen but doesn't carry
6.1,"Ali to Rayudu, 1 run","some turn on this offbreak, worked to leg for one"
5.6,"Morris to Gaikwad, no run","on a length, at him, hits him high on the bat"
5.5,"Morris to Gaikwad, no run","wide half-volley outswinger, driven straight to short extra cover"
5.4,"Morris to Gaikwad, no run","top delivery. On a length, on-pace, pitches just outside off and then seams away against the angle. Beats him"
5.3,"Morris to Gaikwad, no run","slower ball, full, outside off, pushed to cover"
5.2,"Morris to Gaikwad, 2 runs","full, swinging out, push-driven past extra cover for two"
5.1,"Morris to du Plessis, OUT","and Morris strikes first ball back. Du Plessis looks to use the pace on this seam-up delivery. It is on a length, and he is looking to go over cover. Ends up toe-ending it, and Siraj takes a smart catch running back"
4.6,"Chahal to du Plessis, 1 run","slider, middle and leg, runs off the inside half of the bat"
4.5,"Chahal to Gaikwad, 1 run","perfect length-ball legbreak, runs off the outside half of the bat, and another single at cover-point grants them a single"
4.4,"Chahal to Gaikwad, 2 runs","slow, tossed up high, and wide. Gaikwad stays back to cut this to cover-point where a fumble gets them two"
4.3,"Chahal to Gaikwad, no run","looks like a wrong'un, picked off the surface and defended"
4.2,"Chahal to du Plessis, 1 run",pushed to deep cover for one
4.1,"Chahal to Gaikwad, 1 run","dropped but this is a thick edge for a keeper. Gaikwad goes back to cut a shortish ball, and gets a thick thick edge. It is a big deflection. Not really a drop. The only way it is getting caught is off a deflection of the glove but it lands safe"
3.6,"Siraj to du Plessis, no run","du Plessis winds up for a big hit down the ground, Siraj bowls a good slower ball on a length and just outside off. He has to change his mind, and defend to cover"
3.5,"Siraj to du Plessis, SIX runs",not smart. A quick bouncer on a slow pitch with the fine leg up. You want to bounce them? Get the field first. The top edge sails over short fine leg for six
3.4,"Siraj to du Plessis, FOUR runs","ramp this time. Siraj bowls a length ball, short of a length, and du Plessis goes deep in the crease to send this over short fine leg"
3.3,"Siraj to Gaikwad, 1 run","run-out missed. On a length, outside off, pushed straight to Kohli at point, and he missed wildly with the direct hit"
3.2,"Siraj to Gaikwad, FOUR runs","Gaikwad taking them on now. He skips down the wicket, Siraj bowls short of a length, outside off, and he gets on top of the bounce and goes up and over cover with a high-elbow drive"
3.1,"Siraj to Gaikwad, no run","full, outside off, some swing, defended to cover"
2.6,"Sundar to du Plessis, no run","slight shimmy, yorks himself up, digs this out back to Sundar"
2.5,"Sundar to du Plessis, 2 runs","on a length, middle and leg, and he uses soft hands to place this wide of midwicket for two"
2.4,"Sundar to Gaikwad, 1 run","quick length ball, punched down to long-on for one"
2.3,"Sundar to Gaikwad, 2 runs","on a length, angling in, uses soft hands, places this to the left of deep midwicket for two"
2.2,"Sundar to Gaikwad, SIX runs","another nice shot. He knows long-on is back, so he makes room and chips this over mid-off. Just an extension of the arms, and a chip, but he has timed it well enough to send this all the way for a six"
2.1,"Sundar to Gaikwad, no run","on a length, on off, punched to short straight midwicket"
1.6,"Morris to du Plessis, SIX runs","lovoly shot. On-pace, on a length, middle and leg, and he lofts this over midwicket. Using the new ball and the early pace of the pitch"
1.5,"Morris to du Plessis, FOUR runs","tries the yorker, I think, but it is down leg anyway, and he glances this fine of short fine leg for four"
1.4,"Morris to du Plessis, no run","length ball, 133ks, offcutter, hits him high on the bat. Doesn't carry to short cover"
1.3,"Morris to Gaikwad, 1 run","on a length, angling in, clipped away to deep midwicket"
1.2,"Morris to du Plessis, 1 run","short of a length, straight, tucked away off the hip for one"
1.1,"Morris to Gaikwad, 1 run","on a length, straight, pushed to mid-on for one. Padikkal is a little slow there"

19.6,"Chahar to Gurkeerat, 1 run","Man  skips down the wicket, yorks himself up, gets a single to extra cover"
19.5,"Chahar to Sundar, 1 run","slower again, short of a length, hit in the air for a single to long-off"
19.4,"Chahar to Sundar, FOUR runs","lovely shot first up. Slower ball, on a length, outside off, and he stands his ground to drive this over extra cover for four"
19.3,"Chahar to Morris, OUT",yorker. The pitch doesn't matter here. This is just the quick yorker after that big slower one last ball. Disturbs the furniture
19.2,"Chahar to Morris, no run","big slower ball, 114ks, Morris is well early into the slog. Beaten"
19.1,"Chahar to Gurkeerat, 1 run","short of a length, on-pace, pulled to deep midwicket for one"
18.6,"Sam Curran to Kohli, OUT","yet another man perished trying to take on the slowness of this pitch. Excellent catch too. Slower ball, on off, right in the slot, but Kohli can't get enough in it as he looks to clear long-off. Du Plessis sprints to his right to make the catch"
18.5,"Sam Curran to Morris, 1 run","looks to slog at a length ball, gets the inside half of the bat for a single to deep midwicket"
18.4,"Sam Curran to Morris, no run","sharp bouncer, 136ks, hits his helmet right in the badge. Excellent free-hit delivery"
18.4,"Sam Curran to Kohli, (no ball) 1 run","high full toss, steered down to third man. Another fifty for Kohli. In difficult conditions for T20 batting. No-ball too"
18.3,"Sam Curran to Morris, 1 run","low full toss, outside off, dug out to long-on for one"
18.2,"Sam Curran to Kohli, 1 run","down the wicket, low full toss, driven to long-off for one"
18.2,"Sam Curran to Kohli, 1 wide","sees Kohli skip down the wicket, he slips in a lovely wide full delivery past him. And oh, wait a second, this is a shocker. It has been called a wide. It is well inside that wide marker"
18.1,"Sam Curran to Ali, OUT","Ali looks to take on the slow pitch and perishes. Skips down, gets a length ball in the slot, but he ends up hitting this slower offcutter straight to long-off"
17.6,"Chahar to Kohli, 2 runs","down the wicket, Chahar follows him, and he pushes this low full toss wide of long-on for two"
17.5,"Chahar to Ali, 1 run","Moeen looks to smack the first ball big, gets an edge towards long-on for one"
17.4,"Chahar to Kohli, 1 run",short of a length to the advancing Kohli. Just the single to point
17.3,"Chahar to AB, OUT","the slowness of the surface gets de Villiers. A length ball, in the slot, and he looks to hit a six. The knuckle ball does him in, and the mis-hit goes straight down long-on's throat"
17.2,"Chahar to Kohli, 1 run","full, in the slot, and he hits this hard but straight to long-on. He is not happy, and lets out a grunt"
17.1,"Chahar to Kohli, 2 runs",Kohli is skipping down again to make his own pace. Mis-hits this cover-drive but he has placed this in front of deep cover. Comes back for two
16.6,"Jadeja to Kohli, 1 run","quick length ball, middle and leg, pushed into the leg side for one"
16.5,"Jadeja to AB, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to deep cover for one"
16.4,"Jadeja to Kohli, 1 run","on a length, middle and leg, worked to leg for another single"

16.1,"Jadeja to Kohli, 1 run","length ball, into the pads, worked away to leg"

14.5,"Jadeja to AB, 1 run",goes back to punch this length ball to deep cover
14.4,"Jadeja to Kohli, 1 run","Kohli nearly holes out. He jumps out of the crease, Jadeja pulls the length back, and he is beaten so comprehensively in the flight that the mis-hit doesn't even carry to long-on"

13.6,"Tahir to Kohli, FOUR runs",brute power and timing. Down the wicket to take this on the half-volley and drills this down the ground. Straight of long-off it goes for four. Only the second fifty second between Kohli and de Villiers when playing CSK

10.1,"Santner to Kohli, 1 run","on a length, middle and leg, pushed square of short straight midwicket for one"
9.6,"Tahir to AB, FOUR runs","short, wide, de Villiers rocks back to cut this in front of square and beats the man at deep cover to his right"
9.5,"Tahir to Kohli, 1 run","Jadeja misses de Villiers. Kohli has hit this straight to Jadeja at short third, and responds to AB's call. But Ab is really struggling except that Jadeja misses with the direct hit"

9.3,"Tahir to Kohli, 2 runs","uses wrists to drag this drive towards long-on, and comes back for two as he has hit this straight of the man"

8.2,"Santner to AB, FOUR runs","Tahir is quite a few yards off the deep cover fence, which has resulted in four. Driven past cover in the circle, and Tahir fails to cut the angle or dive to his right. This has cost them two runs"
8.1,"Santner to AB, no run","full, middle and off, defended to cover"
7.6,"Tahir to AB, 1 run",de Villiers behind the line this time and works this to leg
7.5,"Tahir to AB, no run","shorter, and it sits in the surface. Takes extra bounce, and beats his attempt to play to cover"
7.4,"Tahir to Kohli, 1 run",goes back to work this length ball into the leg side

6.2,"Santner to Kohli, 1 run",driven to long-on for one
6.1,"Santner to Padikkal, OUT","Padikkal does the right thing but the pitch is slow. He wants to take on spin early, when the ball is still coming on. He steps out to try to hit him over long-on, but he sends it only as far as Faf du Plessis at long-on. While tumbling over he relays the catch to Gaikwad to his left, and Padikkal is gone"

3.6,"Sam Curran to Padikkal, no run","short of a length, just outside off, pushed towards point, who is in tight on the single"
3.5,"Sam Curran to Finch, OUT","Finch will have to wait another day to come off. Curran sees him come down at him, and slips in the slower bouncer, which also cramps Finch up. Finch goes ahead with the aggressive shot, managing only a skier to cover"
3.4,"Sam Curran to Padikkal, 1 run","full, angling in, clipped to deep midwicket for one"
3.3,"Sam Curran to Finch, 1 run","walks down at him, Curran pulls the length back, he works this to deep square for one"
3.2,"Sam Curran to Padikkal, 1 run","slower ball, Padikkal well early into the shot, ends up dragging this towards deep midwicket, but it doesn't carry to the man"

3.1,"Sam Curran to Finch, 1 run","full, angling in, pushed wide of mid-on"
2.6,"Chahar to Padikkal, no run","excellent delivery. Trying to swing this away, but it goes pretty straight in the air, pitches on a length on middle and leg, and then leaves him to beat the bat"

2.4,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 run","swings in again, Padikkal looks for a whip into the leg side and gets a thick inside edge onto the pad"
2.3,"Chahar to Padikkal, no run","on a length, swinging in, headed towards middle and leg. Defended"
2.2,"Chahar to Padikkal, SIX runs","that is a bit of Jayasuriya. A length ball, wide outside off, and he stays back to cut this over point. All the way for six. And this man is way taller than Jayasuriya"
2.1,"Chahar to Padikkal, no run","makes room to try to go over the off side, but is beaten outside off"
1.6,"Monu Kumar to Finch, FOUR runs","down the wicket again, but catches up with this leg-side wide this time and tickles it away for four to fine leg"

1.5,"Monu Kumar to Finch, no run","on a length, angling in, pushed back to Kumar"
1.4,"Monu Kumar to Finch, no run","short and wide, at 127ks. Looks like a bit of a cutter. Finch tries to pull, there is a sound as the ball goes past his bat but nobody appeals. Nothing on the snicko"

1.3,"Monu Kumar to Padikkal, 1 run","wide length ball, cut away to square third man"

0.6,"Chahar to Finch, FOUR runs","inswinger, he sees it early, and also sees it sliding down leg, which gives him the freedom to swing through its line. Plays the pick-up shot over midwicket with a bit of a whip of the wrists"
0.5,"Chahar to Finch, FOUR runs","length-ball outswinger, he stays in the crease and lofts him over mid-off. Doesn't try to hit a six. Just enough to clear the infield"
0.4,"Chahar to Finch, no run","down the wicket again, Chahah bowls a good outswinger around off. Defended back to him"
0.3,"Chahar to Finch, 2 leg byes","walking at him again. He has been doing this all IPL, it seems like. Chahar bowls the inswinger, and that beats him, but he has managed to get outside the line. Gets two leg-byes off the thigh pad"
0.2,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 run","this one swings away from the left-hand batsman, but the pitch is slow and he picks it off the pitch and dabs this behind square on the off side"
0.1,"Chahar to Padikkal, no run","pitched up, wide outside off, left alone"
19.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Ahmed, OUT","run out at the striker's end as Khaleel takes a walk. Good length and just outside off, dabs this to point and literally takes a walk for the most part until he sees point sprinting in at that. It's too late by then and the direct hit has him"
19.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Ahmed, no run","slower ball, short of a length and just outside off and defended into the off side."
19.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Garg, OUT","Jordan settles under that at long-on and takes it! Kings XI are all but there. another short of a length ball, dug in as a cutter. Sitting up at off stump. He backs away and pulls off the toe-end. Jordan watches closely as he moves with the ball and lunges at the very end to take it close to the ground. It's coming off spectacularly for KXIP - they want them to hit leg side and leg side is exactly where they've tried to hit"
19.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Sandeep, OUT","taken at midwicket. Slower ball, short and in at off stump. Sandeep backs into the leg side and makes room. He has swinging room for the pull but it's come off the toe-end and Ashwin plukcs it running to his right"
19.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Garg, 1 run","skied pull shot well in front of fine leg. They take the run. Short and into the body, gets under it and pulls aerially off the high part of the bat"
18.6,"Jordan to Sandeep, no run","he sends it about a yard down the pitch. It's a length ball, just outside off, there for the slog. Slog he does, but it's not his man skill. Off the under-edge and into the pitch"
18.5,"Jordan to Garg, 1 run","full and just outside off, dipping into the corridor. Leans in for an elegant cover drive to sweeper cover"
18.4,"Jordan to Rashid Khan, OUT","he's scythed it straight to sweeper cover! Oh, you're kidding me! Good length ball wide outside off, stretches out at that and simply throws his hands at it, with an open face. It's a long, long boundary and the fielder runs in and takes a straightforward catch"
18.3,"Jordan to Holder, OUT",sliced straight to extra cover! This is full and just outside off. He clears the front leg and wants to go inside-out over extra. The fielder is right on the circle and Holder's bat turns in the hands. This is a simple catch for Mandeep
18.2,"Jordan to Garg, 1 run","full and just outside off, looks to drive through cover and gets an inside edge onto pad"
18.1,"Jordan to Holder, 1 run","nails the yorker at middle stump. Some dip and hoop inwards at Holder, who can only jab it down to long-on"
17.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Garg, no run","good length, another cutter outside off. Gets forward and opens the face to find backward point"
17.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Shankar, OUT","he's got him! Arshdeep's strangle has resulted in an edge. Rolls the fingers on this. Remember, he's around the wicket. So the short of length ball is into Shankar's body. Shankar is walking down into the leg side to try and open the face and get this through backward point and short third man. He gets a thin outside edge to Rahul"
17.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Holder, 1 run","Shankar is down on the ground after running through to the striker's end. The throw has hit him on the left side of the head. He is wearing a helmet against pacers. He usually doesn't, against spinners, and such a blow could have been fatal in that case. He has also survived a run-out chance. It's a short ball just outside off, stabbed to point where Pooran is the man. He sprints in, gather and throws it on the bounce and Shankar is struck on the grille as he grounds his bat. Looks dramatic as he goes down because he was also sprinting full speed. But the medical team is out quickly and he is on his feet pretty soon as well. He's okay. Shakes hands with Pooran and the exchange smiles. He's good to bat on."
17.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Shankar, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, clips to short fine's left off the back foot"
17.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Holder, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, turns it to midwicket's right off the back foot"
17.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Holder, no run","cops that on the box, it appears. Short of a length ball sneaks under his attempted pull and catches him flush in the box"
16.6,"Jordan to Shankar, FOUR runs","oh gorgeous! Another picturesque lofted drive to the straight boundary from Shankar. Mid-off was in so there's no risk in this. It's a length ball just outside off, his feet are static and he offers the full face to loft this over the bowler"
16.5,"Jordan to Holder, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper"
16.4,"Jordan to Shankar, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
16.3,"Jordan to Holder, 1 run","good length outside off, punched off the back foot to sweeper cover"
16.2,"Jordan to Holder, no run","full and just outside off, inside edge onto pad as he looks to stab this through cover"
16.1,"Jordan to Pandey, OUT","taken by long-off running to his right! It's J Suchith, perennial IPL super-sub fielder. Pandey's release shot doesn't come off. This is a full ball just outside off, he looks for the long drive over the bowler's head but it comes off the bottom. Suchith sprints to his right and times the jump perfectly as he takes it with a reverse cup. Then he lands delicately enough to hang on and do a lap in front of his dugout"
16.1,"Jordan to Pandey, 1 wide","full toss down leg side, has a hack at that and misses"
15.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Shankar, no run","googly, short and wide outside off, cut to backward point off the under-edge"

14.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Shankar, 1 run","full outside off, opens the face and runs it through point"
14.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Shankar, FOUR runs","guided past backward point. Full and wide outside off, reaches out and opens the face to find the third man boundary. Third man was in the circle"
14.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Pandey, 1 run",full and into the corridor. Slogs across that and gets it off the thick inside edge to deep midwicket
14.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Pandey, no run","good length outside off, stabbed to extra cover off the back foot"
14.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Shankar, 1 run","overpitched outside off, sweetly driven to long-off"
14.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Pandey, 1 run","good length outside off, punched to long-off on the up"
13.6,"Ashwin to Shankar, FOUR runs",elegant and straight past the bowler. The full face offered again on Shankar's big stride out and he lofts this past where the umpire's head might have been if he hadn't ducked
13.5,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","tossed up wide outside off, driven along the ground to long-off"
13.4,"Ashwin to Pandey, no run","googly, short of a length and turning into the corridor. Backs away for the cut and in the end he's just scrambling to get some bat on it"
13.3,"Ashwin to Shankar, 1 run","short and wide outside off, a crisp cut to sweeper cover"
13.2,"Ashwin to Shankar, no run","good length outside off, jabbed back to the bowler"
13.1,"Ashwin to Shankar, FOUR runs",too much for long-on. This is full and tossed up on leg stump. Gets a nice stride to meet this at the pitch and drives uppishly with the full face offered. It's to long-on's left and Jordan puts in a big dive to his left but can only parry it into the boundary padding
12.6,"Jordan to Pandey, no run","good length and just outside off, pushed back to the bowler on the bounce"
12.5,"Jordan to Shankar, 1 run","full on the pads, flicked to deep backward square"

12.3,"Jordan to Pandey, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven to Maxwell's right at mid-off. He gets the direct hit in and they send it upstairs, but Pandey is safely grounded"

12.1,"Jordan to Pandey, no run","short and wide outside off, he's beaten on the cut"
11.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Shankar, no run","good length outside off, blocked on the front foot"

10.3,"Jordan to Shankar, no run","good length at middle stump, defended off the back foot"
10.2,"Jordan to Shankar, no run",checks the punch and it ends up at mid-off. The pitch is gripping. Short and wide outside off and he pulls out of a forceful punch through cover
10.1,"Jordan to Pandey, 1 run","short and outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
9.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pandey, 1 run","good length and into middle stump, punched towards deep midwicket off the inside half"

9.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Shankar, no run","good length outside off, defended on the front foot"
9.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Shankar, no run","googly, good length and turning in from wide outside off. Big stride out to defend"

8.6,"Shami to Shankar, no run","yorker length at off stump, pushed out to short extra cover"
8.5,"Shami to Abdul Samad, OUT","can't clear mid-off. Overpitched and just outside off, wanted to loft that and was in decent shape and all. But he couldn't find the elevation to beat Chirs Jordan's perfectly-timed leap"
8.4,"Shami to Pandey, 1 run","good length on middle stump, jabbed towards long-on"
8.3,"Shami to Pandey, no run","yorker just outside off, jammed out towards backward point"
8.2,"Shami to Abdul Samad, 1 run","good length and just outside off, a handsome punch on the up to sweeper cover"

7.4,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","googly, wide outside off, reaches out and drives to point's right"
7.3,"Ashwin to Abdul Samad, 1 run","full and coming in from outside off. Looks to crunch that through the covers, gets it down to long-on off the inside half"
7.2,"Ashwin to Bairstow, OUT","bowled round his legs but this is more his doing than the bowler's. This is a full, slider at leg stump and he's walked across into the off side to try and sweep it. He's missed by a long way and that slides into leg stump"
7.1,"Ashwin to Pandey, 1 run","short and wide outside off, backs away and cuts to sweeper cover"
6.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Bairstow, no run",huge lbw appeal turned down and KL reviews again. Good length ball slides past the inside edge as he gets forward to defend and catches him on the back thigh in front of middle stump. Ultra Edge confirms no bat on it. Tracker shows that is missing leg stump by climbing over it. So a decent shout from Paul Reiffel and KXIP are out of reviews with that
6.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pandey, 1 run","good length at off stump, pushed to short cover's left"
6.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pandey, no run","short of a length and angled into middle stump, onto the back foot to pat this to midwicket"
6.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pandey, no run",googly jumping into the pad as he gets on the back foot. He can't get the glance away
6.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Warner, OUT","appeal for catch behind is reviewed by Rahul who looks very confident. It's a full googly outside off, Warner is looking for the reverse whip again, possibly aerial this time. It's past him and into KL's gloves. The ball goes by the Warner's glove on the way to the keepere's gloves and right around then, Ultra Edge shows a spike. Warner had a smile after that review was taken, and is shaking his head as he walks off. Seems like he didn't feel that. But it is a good review for KXIP. Warner won't get a 10th consecutive fifty against them"
6.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Warner, FOUR runs","reverse-whip past short third man. Good length and pushed across him outside off, reaches out and sweeps into the floor and very fine"
5.6,"Ashwin to Bairstow, no run","short of a length outside off, coming back in again. Looks to punch through cover, it comes off the inside half, to the bowler"
5.5,"Ashwin to Bairstow, no run","googly, climbing onto the thigh guard as he stays on the back foot to try and punch this through the leg side"
5.4,"Ashwin to Bairstow, no run","good length and into the corridor, punched to extra cover off the back foot"
5.3,"Ashwin to Bairstow, no run",appeal for lbw as he looks for the reverse sweep against this googly outside off. Rahul says that hit him outside off and turns down the review
5.2,"Ashwin to Bairstow, FOUR runs","oh sweet sound. He has bludgeoned this sweep. Good length and just outside off, down and on the front foot again, and the conventional sweep blazes past square leg"
5.1,"Ashwin to Bairstow, FOUR runs","reverse sweep past backward point. Good length legbreak outside off, gets low, makes up his mind, and gets a wonderful bat swing through this. Shami dives over it, to his right"
4.6,"Shami to Warner, FOUR runs","good length and climbing up at leg stump, but Warner swivels on the back leg and gets front-on before dragging this wide of mid-on with a pull shot"
4.5,"Shami to Warner, no run","good length at middle stump, defended into the covers"
4.4,"Shami to Warner, FOUR runs","flat-batted over the bowler. Short of a length at middle stump, gets the front leg away and hammers this on the up. A slap to clear the bowler"
4.3,"Shami to Bairstow, 1 run","good length outisde off, jabs with hard hands and gets it into the square leg region with a closed face"
4.2,"Shami to Bairstow, no run",good length and cutting in from outside off. Cops it on the thigh as he looks to whip into the leg side
4.1,"Shami to Warner, 1 run","good length at off stump, squeezed into the covers from the crease"
3.6,"Ashwin to Bairstow, no run",doesn't pick this googly as it hits his withdrawn bat. It's a length ball wide outside off and his bat is tucked behind the front foot stride as he looks to leave
3.5,"Ashwin to Bairstow, no run","quicker one, short of a length and outside off. Hurried punch into the pitch"
3.4,"Ashwin to Bairstow, FOUR runs","chopped between keeper and slip.Googly coming back in at off stump, just short of a length. He's jumping into the leg side for the cut and this comes off the edge to dribble past Gayle's left shin"
3.3,"Ashwin to Bairstow, no run",good length and wide outside off. Drives inside the line of that to be beaten as it turns away
3.2,"Ashwin to Bairstow, no run",nearly through him. Googly comes back in sharply as Bairstow is desperate to make room for the punch through the covers. Gets it off the inside half to short fine
3.1,"Ashwin to Warner, 1 run",dropped short and turning into leg stump. Pulled straight to deep square
2.6,"Shami to Bairstow, FOUR runs","low full toss on leg stump, waits on it and clips that to the vacant long leg boundary"
2.5,"Shami to Bairstow, no run","full and just outside off, walks down once again and nearly yorks himself. Taps this off the toe-end to mid-off"
2.4,"Shami to Bairstow, no run","full on middle stump, walks at that and drives to mid-on"
2.3,"Shami to Warner, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, leaps off the pitch as he nudges this down to third man"
2.2,"Shami to Warner, 2 runs",just clears mid-off. Short ball climbing across him and he can't smother the angle with his attempted pull
2.1,"Shami to Warner, no run","good length and just outside off, keeps the front leg clear and drills this on the up to mid-off"
1.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, pings off the thick inside edge to short fine as he has a prod at it"
1.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, no run",good length and cramping him on the mid-riff as he looks to stab that behind square on the leg side
1.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, SIX runs",he's swept him. Over square leg. It's an outswinger on a good length and Warner has got down on a knee and turned this high into the leg side. Incredible skill
1.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Bairstow, 1 run",short of a length and slanted into the corridor. Bairstow looks to force that through the covers and gets a thick inside edge towards fine leg
1.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Bairstow, 1 wide","good length and down leg side, past the attempted flick"
1.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, 1 run","good length on leg stump, glanced to deep square off the back foot"
1.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Bairstow, 1 run",good length and just outside off. Chops it into the pitch off the under-edge and looks up to see Warner absolutley haring down for the run
0.6,"Shami to Warner, 2 runs","short of a length on leg stump, allows that one and nudges to deep square's right before sprinting back and sliding to make his ground as weak throw comes in"
0.5,"Shami to Warner, no run","short at middle stump, subdued pull to short fine leg"
0.4,"Shami to Warner, SIX runs",reaches out and helps that over the extra cover boundary. Overpitched and a lot of width outside off. He got on one knee and ran his hands from under this. Flat and into the ad boards
0.3,"Shami to Warner, no run",big lbw appeal as this one swings into Warner. He's beaten on the flick but that pitched and hit him outside the line of leg stump
0.3,"Shami to Warner, 1 wide","full and down leg side, can't get bat on it"
0.2,"Shami to Warner, no run","full and marginal shape away, starting wide outside off. Left alone"
0.1,"Shami to Warner, 2 runs",good length and in the corridor. Walks into this and opens the face for an easy second to third man's left
19.6,"Natarajan to Pooran, 2 runs","low full toss outside off, driven to deep extra cover's left"
19.5,"Natarajan to Pooran, 2 runs","low full toss outside off, swept along the floor to deep midwicket's left and the throw isn't anywhere near accurate enough"
19.4,"Natarajan to Pooran, no run","beaten again by the wide yorker outside off. Once againhe goes for the chop, this time he can't get bat on it"
19.3,"Natarajan to Pooran, no run","yorker just outside off, tries to chop it past short third man but can't beat him"
19.2,"Natarajan to Pooran, no run","yorker wide outside off, looks for the lap sweep and is beaten. Lovely bowling this, bowling so wide that he can't exploit the square region on the leg side. And with point back on the line, boundary options are difficult"
19.1,"Natarajan to Pooran, FOUR runs","slides though Warner and Rashid backing up behind him can't quite react at the extra cover boundary. Low full toss outside off, driven betweem long-off and deep extra. Looks like it bobbles past Warner's right hand and he misses out as a result"
19.1,"Natarajan to Pooran, 1 wide","forces him to leave that. A wide yorker outside off, he was shaping for the ramp and withdrew late, probably thought that would have been called wide .oh and it was. Looked okay to me given how much Pooran shuffled"
18.6,"Ahmed to Pooran, 1 run","full and just outside off, stabbed out towards long-off"
18.5,"Ahmed to Pooran, no run",vicious yorker has him scrambling to get his foot out of the way. Manages to squeeze it off the inside edge to short fine
18.4,"Ahmed to Pooran, 2 runs","run out chance missed because Khaleel is not at the stumps. Inexplicable, really, there was plenty of time. Warner, the long-on fielder, is furious. It's a length ball nudged towards long-on and the throw is on the bounce and adjacent to the stumps, but the bowler is backing up about a yard and a half behind"
18.3,"Ahmed to Pooran, FOUR runs","at long last, a boundary. After more than 11 overs. A slower short ball at middle stump, sits up nicely for him and he gets half on the front foot and pulls to the square leg boundary"
18.2,"Ahmed to Ashwin, OUT","a direct hit at the non-striker's end. And Ashwin is well short. Full slower ball outside off, gets well forward and opens the face to run this to point. Shankar swoops down on that and releases quickly to hit the stumps on the half volley"
18.1,"Ahmed to Ashwin, 2 runs","full and wide outside off, reaches out and slices to third man's right"
17.6,"Holder to Ashwin, 1 run","slower ball cutting in from a length outside off, watchfully dropped pitch side with soft hands"
17.5,"Holder to Pooran, 1 run","low full toss outside off, driven sweetly along the ground, straight to deep extra cover"
17.4,"Holder to Ashwin, 1 run","full and just outside off, leans in and pushes that to point off the front foot"
17.3,"Holder to Jordan, OUT",taken at short fine. Slower short ball just outside off. Looks for the pull shot again but this grips and gets big on him. The top edge floats straight to the fielder
17.3,"Holder to Jordan, 1 wide","low full toss down leg side, beaten on the flick"
17.2,"Holder to Jordan, 2 runs","slower short ball outside off, waits on that and pulls to deep square's left"
17.1,"Holder to Pooran, 1 run","full toss wide outside off, toe-ended drive into the covers"
16.6,"Ahmed to Pooran, 1 run","good length ball, cutting in at off stump. Inside edge onto pad as he looks to flick this"
16.5,"Ahmed to Jordan, 1 run","good length slower ball on leg stump, gets on the back foot and pushes this into the leg side with soft hands"
16.4,"Ahmed to Pooran, 1 run","good length and just outside off, opens the face and runs to short third"
16.3,"Ahmed to Jordan, 1 run","slower short ball just outside off, punched to extra cover's left. Garg slides to his left to keep  that to one"
16.2,"Ahmed to Pooran, 1 run","slower ball at a length outside off, opens the face and runs it to short third"
16.1,"Ahmed to Pooran, 2 runs","full slower ball outside off, leans in and flicks this down to long-on"
15.6,"Natarajan to Pooran, 1 run","full and wide outside off, slashed out to deep backward point"
15.5,"Natarajan to Jordan, 1 run","low full toss on leg stump, patted down to long-on"
15.4,"Natarajan to Jordan, no run","good length cutter, rising past the outside edge as he looks to defend off the back foot"
15.3,"Natarajan to Jordan, no run","slower ball at a length, pushed wide of the corridor outside off. Looks for the cut, gets it off the under-edge into the pitch"
15.2,"Natarajan to Jordan, 2 runs","good length on the pads, onto the back foot to push this to short fine leg's left"
15.2,"Natarajan to Jordan, 1 wide","good length and down leg side, beaten on the flick"
15.1,"Natarajan to Pooran, 1 run","full and wide outside off, looks for the big drive off the front foot. Gets it to sweeper's right"
14.6,"Rashid Khan to Jordan, no run","good length and sliding onto off stump, defended off the back foot"
14.5,"Rashid Khan to Jordan, no run",good length and ripping past the outside edge as he hangs the bat out at it
14.4,"Rashid Khan to Jordan, no run","good length outside off, pushed into the covers"
14.3,"Rashid Khan to Jordan, no run","good length on middle stump, gets on the back foot and flicks to short fine"
14.2,"Rashid Khan to Hooda, OUT",excited stumping appeal from YJB. This legbreak outside off turns past his bat as he looks to flick and his back leg has dragged out and is in the air as that happens. Bairstow quick to break the stumps and that is a straightforward decision for the third umpire
14.1,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, 1 run",good length and turning into the body. Nudged to deep square's right off the back foot
13.6,"Sandeep to Hooda, no run","good length and just outside off, punched back to the bowler on the front foot"
13.6,"Sandeep to Hooda, 1 wide","bouncer in the corridor, sways away from that to let it go. It's above head height"
13.5,"Sandeep to Pooran, 1 run","full at middle stump, shuffles and drives to long-on"
13.4,"Sandeep to Maxwell, OUT","he finds long-on. Warner tracks it to his right, stretches to take it and drops to the floor to complete it all. It's full and into middle stump. Clears the front leg and looks for the slog, but gets no elevation on it. It's a big boundary and Warner takes it well inside as it dips to his right"
13.3,"Sandeep to Maxwell, 2 runs","slower ball, short of a length outside off. Mistimed pull to long-on's right"
13.2,"Sandeep to Maxwell, 2 runs","knuckle ball at a length outside off, steps out and drives on the rise to long-off's left"
13.1,"Sandeep to Pooran, 1 run","short of a length outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
12.6,"Natarajan to Maxwell, no run","yorker at off stump, the attempted drive trickles off the toe-end to extra cover"
12.5,"Natarajan to Maxwell, 2 runs","good length outside off, half a stride forward to punch to sweeper's right"
12.4,"Natarajan to Pooran, 1 run","good length at off stump, uses the angle and shovels this to deep midwicket"
12.3,"Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length and wide outside off. Slaps that on the rise and to sweeper's left"
12.2,"Natarajan to Pooran, 1 leg bye",short of a length and skidding low in the corridor again. Looks to pull again and cops that on the raised front pad
12.1,"Natarajan to Pooran, no run",beaten on the pull. That stays lower in the corridor than he expected as he set up on the back foot
11.6,"Holder to Pooran, 1 run","full at middle stump, flicked uppishly to deep square's right"
11.5,"Holder to Maxwell, 1 run","short of a length slower ball just outside off, shuffles and clips to fine leg"

10.4,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, 1 run","full googly outside off, leans in and drives to long-off"
10.3,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to long-off"
10.2,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, no run",good length and into the body. Tapped into the covers
10.1,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, OUT","through him with a beauty! KL Rahul has missed two consecutive googlies from Rashid. The second one tonks middle stump. KXIP have lost two in two after a watchful start. This is tossed up outside off, dipping deliciously to draw Rahul forward. He drives for the one that turns, tying to poke it through the covers, but that's snuck past the inside edge to hit the stumps. Genius from Rashid to get a batsman of Rahul's form like that"
9.6,"Holder to Gayle, OUT","drilled straight to Warner at long-off! Loopy slower ball outside off, brings the bat down on that rather than swing through it to get distance. It's flat, throat height and pouched by an elated Warner"
9.5,"Holder to Gayle, no run","yorker at middle stump, squeezed out to midwicket"
9.4,"Holder to Rahul, 1 run","yorker at leg stump, jammed down to long-on"
9.3,"Holder to Gayle, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven to cover"
9.2,"Holder to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length and into the pads, caressed down to fine leg with a pull"
9.1,"Holder to Gayle, 1 run","top edge over the keeper and third man cleans up to his right. Short of a length slower ball, rising in the corridor as he looks to pull"
9.1,"Holder to Gayle, 1 wide","low full toss, very very wide outside off"
8.6,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, no run","googly, short of a length and ripping into the body. He doesn't pick it and his attempted punch through the off side ends up at midwicket"
8.5,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, no run","good length and wide outside off, reaches out and guides it to backward point"
8.4,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, no run",good length and turning away from middle stump. Squared up as he defends the legbreak off the outside part of the bat
8.3,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, 1 run","full on middle stump, mistimed sweep to deep square's left"
8.2,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, no run","it's taken some convincing but Warner takes a review against the lbw decision. Gwhip this. Gayle is pinned in front of the stumps on the back foot, struck around the knee roll as he tries to glance. But that has pitched outside leg and they lose the review. Keeper and bowler looked convinced. Tracker also shows the ball was climbing over leg stump"
8.1,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, no run","full and pushed through quick at leg stump, looks for the slog and cops that on the pad"
7.6,"Natarajan to Gayle, 1 run","yorker in the corridor, jams it into the pitch and it bounces over the bowler for a single at long-off"
7.5,"Natarajan to Gayle, no run","full and just outside off, left alone"
7.4,"Natarajan to Rahul, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
7.3,"Natarajan to Gayle, 1 run","good length on leg stump, glanced to fine leg off the back foot"
7.2,"Natarajan to Gayle, no run","good length and into leg stump, pushed to midwicket off the back foot"
7.1,"Natarajan to Rahul, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to sweeper cover off the back foot"
6.6,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, no run","rips past the outside edge. Googly, short of a length on leg and squaring him up as he gets onto the back foot to defend. A big appeal from the keeper. The sound might have been the ball brushing the top of the left pad"
6.5,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, SIX runs","clears long-on. By just enough in the end. It's a miscued pull. Or a hurried one, at the very least. Short of a length and skidding on quickly at middle stump. It's almost a speculative pull in the end, comes off the inside part, but it's into the cameramen"
6.4,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, no run","googly, short of a length and hurrying him outside off. Mistimed cut to extra cover"
6.3,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, 1 run","googly, turning into middle stump. He's onto the back foot to punch to long-on"
6.2,"Rashid Khan to Gayle, 1 run","good length and at middle stump, onto the back foot to push through midwicket"
6.1,"Rashid Khan to Rahul, 1 run","low full toss at off stump, driven along the floor to long-on"
5.6,"Holder to Gayle, no run","yorker and just outside off, looks to chop behind point but is beaten this time"
5.5,"Holder to Gayle, FOUR runs","slower short ball just outside off, waits on it and opens the face late to get the late cut past short third man"
5.4,"Holder to Gayle, no run","good length and just outside off, pushed into the covers"
5.3,"Holder to Gayle, FOUR runs","good length and just outside off, brings the hammer down on that, hardly any feet, but the off-drive is well to mid-off's right"
5.2,"Holder to Rahul, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
5.1,"Holder to Gayle, 1 bye","friendly, knee-high full toss outside off and Gayle misses it completely on the drive. And the bounce is a bit awkward for YJB who doesn't gather cleanly and has to give chase"
4.6,"Sandeep to Mandeep, OUT",Rashid takes it at deep square leg. Looked like a knuckle ball. Full and at off stump. Gets on one knee again and hits this high into the evening sky with the attempted slog. Rashid has to run in a little and to his left. Samad tracks back from midwicket for a bit but lets it be. Rashid follows it as it dips on him and hangs on safely
4.5,"Sandeep to Mandeep, no run","good length outside off, poked into the off side"
4.4,"Sandeep to Mandeep, FOUR runs","the ball slips from Samad's hands at the boundary and two turns to four. Legcutter, good length and just outside off. Gets down and brings out a miscued slog sweep. Samad sprints to his right at long-on and picks up with his right hand, but it looks like the swing of the hand has met his leg and he's lost his bearings"
4.3,"Sandeep to Mandeep, 2 runs",short of a length and angled into off stump. Backs away to try and punch through the covers but he's through it too soon. It gets the thick inside part of the bat and just evades mid-off to the right
4.2,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","full at middle stump, driven along the ground to long-on"
4.1,"Sandeep to Rahul, SIX runs","pumped over the midwicket boundary! He's sent that into the top tier. It's dropped short outside off and he's nicely set with swinging room for the lofted pull. And once again, it is an absolutely delicious connection off the middle of the bat"
3.6,"Ahmed to Mandeep, 2 runs",just evades Warner running back from mid-off. Full slower ball and Mandeep is down on one knee early for the drive. He's outfoxed. Ends up lofting this a few yards behind Warner who runs back and puts in a big dive as it bounces past his face
3.5,"Ahmed to Rahul, 1 run","good length outside off, punched to sweeper cover"
3.4,"Ahmed to Rahul, FOUR runs","clattered wide of mid-on. Short of a length across him and he hangs on the back foot for the pull, gets it right off the middle and you can hear the echoes in the stadium"
3.3,"Ahmed to Mandeep, 1 run","good length and pushed across off stump, punched to sweeper cover"
3.2,"Ahmed to Mandeep, 2 runs","short of a length and just outside off, looks for the aerial pull but gets it off the high part of the bat. Clears midwicket"
3.1,"Ahmed to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, onto the back foot to pat this behind square on the off side"
2.6,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched on the rise to extra cover's right. Big dive there but only a touch managed on the way to mid-off"
2.5,"Sandeep to Rahul, no run","short of a length outside off, chopped to point"
2.4,"Sandeep to Mandeep, 3 runs","short and wide outside off, gets big on him and he uses it to cut that over the cover point fielder who then gives chase to pull it in"
2.3,"Sandeep to Mandeep, no run","good length and just outside off, punched into the covers off the back foot"
2.2,"Sandeep to Mandeep, no run","good length and just outside off, chops into the off side off the front foot"
2.1,"Sandeep to Mandeep, no run","good length and just outside off, steps out and drives on the rise to extra cover"
1.6,"Ahmed to Rahul, no run","length outside off, driven on the rise to extra cover"
1.5,"Ahmed to Rahul, no run","good length and just outside off, defended into the off side"
1.4,"Ahmed to Rahul, FOUR runs",thick edge to the third man boundary. Looks to drive this length ball through the covers from outside off and ends up playing inside the line
1.3,"Ahmed to Rahul, no run","good length and at the stumps, drops it in the infield on the leg side and wants to sneak the run but he's sent back. On the way back there's a direct hit with an under-arm flick, from Shankar it appears, but replays show Rahul has made his ground"
1.2,"Ahmed to Rahul, no run","full and just outside off, driven along the floor to cover point"
1.1,"Ahmed to Rahul, no run","good length and just outside off, punched to cover off the back foot"
0.6,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run",good length and curved into middle stump. Punched to mid-om off the back foot
0.5,"Sandeep to Mandeep, 1 run","good length and just outside off, opens the face and runs it to third man"
0.4,"Sandeep to Mandeep, no run","good length and into middle stump, pushed into the leg side off the front foot"
0.3,"Sandeep to Mandeep, 2 runs","full inswinger at middle stump, walks at it and clips to mid-on who rushes in and misses the ball with the attempted single-handed pick up. Samad took his eye off too early"
0.2,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","full in-dipper at the pads, leans in and clips it to mid-on's right"
0.1,"Sandeep to Rahul, no run","full inswinger at off stump, defended down the pitch"
19.6,"Ferguson to Ashwin, no run","quick short ball, gets the bottom edge to short third man. Ashwin has the right idea. He wants the single. Nortje sends him back"
19.5,"Ferguson to Deshpande, OUT","and a length ball produces another catch at long-on. This is just a languid hit, which he has timed well enough to carry it all the way to the fence. DC could still be bowled out"
19.4,"Ferguson to Ashwin, 1 run","yorker now, dug out for a single to long-on"
19.3,"Ferguson to Ashwin, no run","slower bouncer, outside off, beaten on the ramp. He wants the wide call but doesn't get it"
19.2,"Ferguson to Deshpande, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, he opens the face for a single"
19.1,"Ferguson to Ashwin, 1 run","low full toss, squeezed out to deep cover for one"
18.6,"Cummins to Deshpande, no run","yorker, on the spot, dug out back to him"
18.5,"Cummins to Rabada, OUT","length ball, into the pads, and Cummins has got another wicket. Not the best ball to get a wicket with but he has bowled quite a few good ones in the previous games for no rewards in the last column. This has been hit straight down the throat of long-on"
18.4,"Cummins to Rabada, no run",slower wide full ball as Rabada backs away. Another dot
18.3,"Cummins to Rabada, no run","low full toss, nearly a yorker, dug out back to him"
18.2,"Cummins to Ashwin, 1 run",Cummins responds with a near yorker. dug out towards long-on for one
18.1,"Cummins to Ashwin, FOUR runs","lovely shot but all too late. Driven on top of the bounce, past extra cover, thuds into the fence"
17.6,"Varun to Ashwin, 1 run",nice little hit straight of long-off but not powerful enough
17.5,"Varun to Rabada, 1 run","wrong'un, swept away to deep midwicket. Straight of him"
17.4,"Varun to Rabada, no run","full, dipping, nearly a yorker, dug out back to him"
17.3,"Varun to Rabada, FOUR runs","excellent shot. Picks the offbreak, goes down on a knee, and hits him straight of long-off"
17.2,"Varun to Ashwin, 1 run","he sweeps, but straight to deep square leg for one"
17.1,"Varun to Rabada, 1 run","wrong'un, on a length, Rabada pushes it into the leg side for one"
16.6,"Cummins to Ashwin, FOUR runs",Ashwin moves across his wicket to pull this shortish ball past midwicket and all the way to the midwicket fence. Along the ground
16.5,"Cummins to Rabada, 1 run",hit in the air but it falls short of mid-off. Early into his push. Takes the tight single
16.4,"Cummins to Ashwin, 1 run","looking for yorker, gives him the low full toss, driven to deep cover"
16.3,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run","short of a length, outside off, punched to cover"
16.2,"Cummins to Ashwin, no run","extra bounce from short of a length, and beats Ashwin's attempt at the late-cut"
16.1,"Cummins to Rabada, 1 run","on a length, angling in, hits the bat high"
15.6,"Varun to Ashwin, no run","quick length ball, Ashwin opens the face, can't beat short third man"
15.5,"Varun to Axar Patel, OUT","that's the five-for. The wrong'un this time. Hits the top of off. The first five-for for KKR since Narine did it in 2012. Seems like Axar has picked the wrong'un and is looking to make room and hit it over the off side, but he has been done in completely by the flight first and then the turn. the first five-for of this IPL"
15.4,"Varun to Rabada, 1 run","slower in the air, outside off, punched to long-off for one"
15.3,"Varun to Axar Patel, 1 run","quicker, length ball, pushed into the leg side for one"
15.2,"Varun to Axar Patel, no run","on a length, legcutter, hit back to him"
15.1,"Varun to Stoinis, OUT",No. 4 for Varu. The legcutter is turning enough to do the DC hitters in. And none of them is looking to hit with the turn. All four have perished hitting to leg with the ball turning away from them. Another big outer edge as the ball turns away from him. Taken easily at long-off
14.6,"Narine to Axar Patel, no run","tries the big sweep, is beaten and hit on the pad, but this is pitched outside leg"
14.5,"Narine to Stoinis, 1 run","offbreak, straight, worked into the leg side for one"
14.4,"Narine to Stoinis, 2 runs","carrom ball, short of a length, pulled into the leg side. Wide of long-on. Bigger boundary means they get two"
14.3,"Narine to Axar Patel, 1 run","short of a length, no pace or room, tucked away off the hip"
14.2,"Narine to Axar Patel, SIX runs","slog sweep against the turn, but to the shorter boundary, and Patel has connected this well enough to clear deep midwicket"
14.1,"Narine to Stoinis, 1 run","slow offbreak, middle and leg, guided to short fine for one"
13.6,"Varun to Stoinis, 1 run","full legcutter, driven to long-on for one"
13.5,"Varun to Axar Patel, 1 run","offbreak, on a length, just outside off, pushed past point"
13.5,"Varun to Axar Patel, 1 wide",wide down the leg side
13.4,"Varun to Stoinis, 1 run","slow and loopy all right, but wide and too full. Driven hard to long-off"
13.3,"Varun to Iyer, OUT","and he is on a hat-trick. That earlier drop has not cost them anything. Lovely carrom-ball legcutter, on a length, outside off. Iyer likes the length and wants to go over long-on, but there is a puff of dust where the ball pitches, and the ball turns away from it. He toe-ends a skier to long-on"
13.2,"Varun to Hetmyer, OUT","but Varun gets the other big hitter. Seems like wrong'un, Hetmyer sees it in is swinging arc, clears the front leg and tries to go over long-on. The top edge only carries as far as the boundary edge where he is caught smartly"
13.1,"Varun to Iyer, 1 run",dropped by Varun himself. Iyer tries to hit a big six but gets a massive top edge towards straight cover. Varun calls it for himself even though he is running back. Might have been better off letting the guy running in take this. Doesn't even get a hand on it
12.6,"Narine to Hetmyer, SIX runs","Hetmyer breaks the shackles. On a length, outside off, Hetmyer clears the front leg and swings hard to create his own pace on this. It goes very high but long enough to clear the fielder at long-on"
12.5,"Narine to Iyer, 1 run","tries the big slog, but Narine again stays slow and outside off. The toe end goes to leg"
12.4,"Narine to Iyer, no run","on a length, no room, punched hard to cover"
12.3,"Narine to Iyer, 2 runs","offbreak, slow, on a length, punched straight of long-on for two"
12.2,"Narine to Hetmyer, 1 run","wide length ball, outside off, and he mis-hits this wide of long-off"
12.1,"Narine to Iyer, 3 runs","Iyer looks to lap him, but Narine gives him no pace to work with. He doesn't get the boundary but will take three"
11.6,"Varun to Hetmyer, 2 runs","on a length, outside leg, soft hands, gets a couple of wide long-on"
11.5,"Varun to Iyer, 1 run","quick, short, 105ks, Iyer late into the pull, manages to get this wide of midwicket"
11.4,"Varun to Hetmyer, 1 run","on a length, legcutter, punched to wide long-on"
11.3,"Varun to Iyer, 1 run","quick, flat, on a length, pushed to deep cover for one"
11.2,"Varun to Pant, OUT","caught on the long leg-side boundary. And not even the boundary. Well inside. Varun bowls the wrong'un, full, outside leg, and Pant plays the kinda vertical sweep that he does. The top edge is taken at deep square leg"
11.1,"Varun to Pant, no run","legcutter, around off, defended back to him"
10.6,"Ferguson to Iyer, no run","Iyer keeps backing away after shuffling across, but Ferguson is not falling for it again. Beats him with the short ball this time"
10.5,"Ferguson to Pant, 1 run","quick sharp skiddy short ball, keeps the pull down for one"
10.4,"Ferguson to Iyer, 1 run","the double shuffle from Iyer again, Ferguson bowls short this time, cut away to deep cover"
10.3,"Ferguson to Iyer, FOUR runs","Iyer is stepping it up here. Shuffles across early, then backs away, takes a full ball and goes inside-out, wide of mid-off"
10.2,"Ferguson to Iyer, FOUR runs","picks his spot. Just a touch too full. He has mid-off up so he is likely to bowl short of a length, but gets into the length zone, and Iyer drives it over mid-off"
10.1,"Ferguson to Iyer, 2 runs","short of a length, into the body, tucked away into a hole on the leg side, the bigger boundary"
9.6,"Narine to Iyer, 1 run",again he keeps denying Iyer the hitting length or the pace to work with. Hit hard but straight down to long-on
9.5,"Narine to Pant, 1 run","slog sweep into the bigger part of the ground, and there is a deep midwicket in place"
9.4,"Narine to Iyer, 1 run","slow, short of a length, Iyer can't find any timing on the pull"
9.3,"Narine to Pant, 1 run","down the wicket, beaten in flight, driven down the ground and straight of long-off"
9.2,"Narine to Iyer, 1 run","Narine stays on a length, and gives Iyer no pace to work with. Punched to wide long-on for one"
9.1,"Narine to Pant, 1 run",down the wicket to push this length ball to long-off for one
8.6,"Ferguson to Pant, 1 run","on a length, quick, 148ks, outside off, pushed wide of cover for one"
8.5,"Ferguson to Pant, no run","yorker, on off, dug out to mid-on"
8.4,"Ferguson to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, at him, Iyer opens the face for a single"
8.3,"Ferguson to Pant, 1 run","gets inside the line of this length ball and whips this fine of fine leg. The tall lanky fast bowler, Krishna, does well to keep this down to one"
8.2,"Ferguson to Pant, FOUR runs","on pace, on length, outside off, and he clears the front leg and slogs him over midwicket for four"
8.1,"Ferguson to Pant, no run","big slower ball, half-volley outside off, hit back to Ferguson"
7.6,"Narine to Pant, 1 run","offbreak, Pant is down the wicket to punch this down to long-on"
7.5,"Narine to Pant, no run","down the wicket, Narine slows it down, and he ends up playing it back to Narine"
7.4,"Narine to Pant, no run","on a length, just outside off, defended back to him"
7.3,"Narine to Iyer, 1 run","carrom ball, it seems like, punched to deep cover"
7.2,"Narine to Iyer, 2 runs","on a length, middle and leg, worked into the leg side"
7.1,"Narine to Iyer, 2 runs","this is a newish action, the leading arm breaks away early and stays away from the rest of the body. Bowls down the leg side, is worked away"
7.1,"Narine to Iyer, 1 wide",starts off with a wide down the leg side
6.6,"Ferguson to Iyer, 1 run","wide length ball, driven on the up, just the single to deep cover"
6.5,"Ferguson to Pant, 1 run","full and fast, hit back softly towards the bowler, and he hits the wicket at the non-striker's end. Takes the single off the defelction"
6.4,"Ferguson to Pant, no run","and now he looks to go to leg after shuffling across, but falls over and is beaten outside off"
6.3,"Ferguson to Pant, FOUR runs","not much wrong with this ball but Pant has punched this away for four. Short of a length, no room, but he slaps this square of backward point and in front of deep third man"
6.2,"Ferguson to Pant, 2 runs","bouncer, gets big on him, still manages to clear the infield with the pull and gets a couple to deep midwicket"
6.1,"Ferguson to Pant, no run",and suddenly you can tell the extra pace when a length ball hits the bat high. Defended to leg
5.6,"Nagarkoti, to Pant, 1 run","on a length, just outside off, pushed wide of cover"
5.5,"Nagarkoti, to Pant, no run","on a length, 138ks, outside off, opens the face to point"
5.4,"Nagarkoti, to Pant, no run","short of a length, not much room outside off, punched to extra cover"
5.3,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, 1 run","moves around in the crease as he often does, but Nagarkoti doesn't budge from his length. Iyer opens the face to takes a single to point"
5.2,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, no run","on a length, middle and off, hits him high on the bat"
5.1,"Nagarkoti, to Pant, 1 run","short, rib-high, pulled to deep square leg. Falls short of him"
4.6,"Prasidh to Pant, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, pushed to point"
4.6,"Prasidh to Pant, 1 wide","big slower ball, loopy full toss outside leg. This is called wide. A never-ending over"
4.5,"Prasidh to Iyer, 1 run","length ball, outside off, slogged to deep midwicket. He is caught but this is a free hit, remember. He has bowled the free hit well to have sent the slog to one of the two fielders outside the circle"
4.5,"Prasidh to Pant, (no ball) 1 leg bye","this is a good bouncer on the free hit, Pant is beaten on the hook, and hit on the helmet. But another no-ball. A big one"
4.5,"Prasidh to Pant, (no ball)","near yorker, outside off, driven to mid-off. This is a no-ball"
4.4,"Prasidh to Pant, no run","yorker, just outside off, dug out back to him"
4.3,"Prasidh to Pant, no run","wide length ball, driven on the up, but straight to mid-off"
4.2,"Prasidh to Pant, SIX runs","oh the Pant we know. This is bouncer outside off, and he gets inside the line of it to help it along over short fine leg. His head is down when he plays the shot and not even looking at the ball"
4.1,"Prasidh to Pant, no run","short of a length, at him, Pant looks to work this to let, gets a leading edge, which falls short of the diving Krishna"
3.6,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, no run","short of a length, outside off, pushed to point"
3.5,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, no run","short of a length, outside off, gets a bottom edge"
3.4,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, FOUR runs","and he picks this same gap bu shuffling across to convert this length ball into a straight ball. He has taken this from outside off, and clipped it behind square on the leg side"
3.3,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, FOUR runs","tucked away off the hip, and the fine leg is in and deep square leg is forward of square. And this rolls into the gap and into the boundary"
3.2,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, no run","short of a length again, but this time there is no room to work with. Defended back to him"
3.1,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, no run","short of a length, wide, punched to point"
2.6,"Cummins to Pant, no run","short of a length, just outside off, fended back to him"
2.5,"Cummins to Pant, no run","on the front foot to a shortish ball, hit high on the bat as he defends"
2.4,"Cummins to Pant, no run","short of a length, angling in, punched to point"
2.3,"Cummins to S Dhawan, OUT","like the London buses. And it tells you the old thing about bowling: you keep bowling well for long enough, and the wickets will come. And if they come after a long interval, they will come in clutches. Lovely ball to get the form man. On a length, angling in towards middle, then holding its line against the angle and uprooting the off stump. Dhawan likes to stay legside of the ball anyway. At 147.4ks too"
2.2,"Cummins to S Dhawan, no run","on a length, driven nicely on the up, but straight to extra cover"
2.1,"Cummins to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, hits the splice of the bat, they rush through for a quick single to cover. Morgan slips a little as he gets ready to throw"
1.6,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","Dhawan shows his form. Jumps out of the crease early, gets under this wide length ball, and sends it crashing over cover-point"
1.5,"Prasidh to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, tucked away off the hip"
1.4,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, no room, he looks to punch this to off, and gets an inside edge for a single to leg"
1.3,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, no run","on a length, middle and leg, punched to mid-on"
1.2,"Prasidh to Iyer, 1 run","on a length, angling in, pushed wide of mid-on for one"
1.1,"Prasidh to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, bottom edge on the cut for Dhawan"
0.6,"Cummins to Iyer, no run","on a length, angling in, pushed to mid-on"
0.5,"Cummins to Iyer, no run","short of a length, at his body, defended back to him"
0.4,"Cummins to Iyer, no run","on a length, into the pads, flicked away to leg, but straight to midwicket"
0.3,"Cummins to Iyer, no run","short of a length, no room, defended back to him"
0.2,"Cummins to Iyer, FOUR runs","full and straight again, looking for the lbw again, but Iyer plays a more forceful shot, and also this one doesn't jag back in. Not too wide of mid-on, but no dive comes in. And he doesn't anticipate the angle well enough either. Narine is the fielder"
0.1,"Cummins to Rahane, OUT","plumb lbw first ball. Wickets have been few and far between for Cummins, but he has struck immediately here. Full ball, the seam is not perfectly upright, but it pitches outside off and jags back in to beat Rahane's defensive prod. Dead in front"
19.6,"Stoinis to Morgan, OUT","another wide bouncer, another high ball, and another top edge. Rabada runs back from short fine leg to take the catch. A good last over from Stoinis given what had happened earlier"
19.5,"Stoinis to Rana, OUT","short, outside off, gets it high, and Rana has fallen to a short ball that has got big. Who would have thought? Except that it has happened in the last over of the innings and not the first. Top edge for a catch inside the circle. A very important hand in an emotional time for Rana"
19.4,"Stoinis to Rana, FOUR runs","full and wide, looking to deny him the leg-side hit, but the off side is also Rana's strength. And this is a half-volley. He opens the face and drives over backward point for four"
19.3,"Stoinis to Rana, FOUR runs","looks to drag this short ball from wide outside off, and gets a toe-end edge between the keeper and short fine leg"
19.2,"Stoinis to Rana, 2 runs","goes full and wide to a shuffling Rana, and he ends up slicing a low full toss square of deep cover for two"
19.1,"Stoinis to Rana, no run","oh Rana, why Rana? Tries the reverse ramp to an on-pace length ball. This is fair game for a wild slog over midwicket. What a miss. Beaten"
18.6,"Rabada to Morgan, FOUR runs","bonus runs but a love;y shot nonetheless. Ten runs so far off the Rabada over, and he makes room, and Rabada follows him with a short ball. He takes this from outside leg, opens the face, and guides it between short third and point"
18.5,"Rabada to Morgan, SIX runs",nice knee-high full toss. Yoroker gone wrong. Morgan sends him for a six back over his head. All unfurling of the wrists at the last moment. As Morgan often does with these hits
18.4,"Rabada to Rana, 1 run","nearly a yorker, outside leg again as Rana makes room. Squeezed out for one to point"
18.3,"Rabada to Morgan, 1 run","short of a length, no room, punched to deep point for one"
18.2,"Rabada to Rana, 1 run","slower ball, nearly a yorker, outside leg as he is making room. Pushed into the covers for one"
18.1,"Rabada to Morgan, 1 run","low full toss, takes the inside edge, single to short fine leg"
17.6,"Nortje to Rana, FOUR runs","finds the gap. Rana is looking to open up the short boundary by shuffling across, and he ends up slogging a length ball towards square leg. The fielder is there, and the ball has gone in air, but just wide of his dive"
17.5,"Nortje to Rana, no run","well bowled. Rana opens up the front leg, but he goes with a quick yorker outside off. Ends up being a low full toss but is out of Rana's reach"
17.4,"Nortje to Morgan, 1 run","slower ball again, nearly a yorker, dug out to cover for one"
17.3,"Nortje to Morgan, no run",shuffles across to try to access the short leg boundary. Nortje beats him with a slower ball that squeezes under his slog
17.2,"Nortje to Morgan, FOUR runs",mid-off is up so Morgan picks his spot. Gets under a length ball and lofts him over mid-off. Doesn't need to go for the six here. Just needs to clear 30 yards
17.1,"Nortje to Morgan, no run","short of a length, outside off, he opens the face but is beaten"
16.6,"Rabada to Rana, FOUR runs","the first proper bouncer to Rana all day, but without the field you need for a bouncer. The top edge sails over short fine leg for four. Very questionable plans and field sets from DC"
16.5,"Rabada to Rana, no run","slower ball, full outside off, hit straight to extra cover"
16.4,"Rabada to Narine, OUT","big boundary and Rabada gets his man. He digs this in short, cramps Narine up by following him, meaning the short off boundary is taken out of play. He pulls, makes a decent connection, but not decent enough to clear the big square-leg boundary. Caught, but has he played a match-turning, a season-turning knock here?"
16.4,"Rabada to Rana, 2 wide","slower short ball, down the leg side. This is a wide. And Pant fails to collect the half-volley. Another bye to go with it"
16.3,"Rabada to Rana, no run","misses out. This is a quick length ball angled down leg, and all he needs is a tickle. Instead it clips the pad on the way. Doesn't even get the wide ball"
16.2,"Rabada to Rana, no run","he makes room again, and Rabada follows him and he is beaten outside the leg stump"
16.1,"Rabada to Rana, FOUR runs","and now all bets are off. In the last four, outside edges will also fly. Rabada bowls length from round the wicket, Rana looks to go over mid-off and cover, but gets a thick edge over short third man"
15.6,"Deshpande to Narine, FOUR runs","top shot. Was looking like it might be the first over without a boundary in a long time, but he shuffles across to reach this full wide one and drives it between mid-off and extra cover for four"
15.5,"Deshpande to Rana, 1 run","stays full and wide, tough to reach it, dug out for just the single"
15.4,"Deshpande to Narine, 1 run","full, outside off, driven past the slow-diving extra cover"
15.3,"Deshpande to Narine, 2 runs","full and wide again, this time he gets bat on it, and thick outside edge brings them two"
15.2,"Deshpande to Narine, no run","full slot ball outside off, he looks to go over long-off, but swings down the wrong line"
15.1,"Deshpande to Narine, no run","another wide, but this time not called because the batsman has shuffled across"
15.1,"Deshpande to Narine, 1 wide",staats off with a big wide outside off
14.6,"Ashwin to Rana, no run","quicker, shorter, no room, punched to point for one. Six feet either side, and this would be four too"
14.5,"Ashwin to Rana, 2 runs","slower in the air, swept away fine, nearly beats short fine, and gets a second off the fumble"
14.4,"Ashwin to Narine, 1 run","Ashwin goes round-arm, almost like Jadhav, full, on off, drilled to long-off"
14.3,"Ashwin to Narine, SIX runs","legbreak, he picks it, and goes over for the big leg-side fence. Clean straight hit over long-on. That is a brave and well-timed hit"
14.2,"Ashwin to Narine, 2 runs","that's fifty for Narine. Sams might have given him a life here. Falls just short of the substitute fielder at deep backwards square leg, but this has been in the air for long. Reason for Ashwin to be disappointed"
14.1,"Ashwin to Narine, FOUR runs","short of a length, quick, and he drives him on the up, between deep cover and long-off. The short boundary means he gets four instead of two"
13.6,"Stoinis to Rana, FOUR runs","now he is picking his spots. Stoinis bowls full and wide, and he goes deep into the crease, breaks his back knee to get under it, and drives this in the air ans wide of deep cover. A Raina-like shot from a batsman who has a Raina-like weakness against the short ball"
13.5,"Stoinis to Narine, 1 run","slower ball outside off, edged away as he drives, but it falls well short of Pant"
13.4,"Stoinis to Narine, no run","full and wide, beats him on the drive"
13.3,"Stoinis to Narine, no run","full and outside off, left alone"
13.3,"Stoinis to Narine, 1 wide",goes slower again and trying to get out of Narine's reach. Ends up bowling a big wide outside off
13.2,"Stoinis to Narine, FOUR runs","short of a length, wide, slower, and he rocks back to punch him over straight extra cover. This is brutal batting"
13.1,"Stoinis to Narine, SIX runs",bowling short at Narine with the short leg-side boundary at Stoinis's pace? Not a good idea. Smoked away for a six over midwicket. This is only slightly higher than his waist
12.6,"Nortje to Rana, FOUR runs","and when it is going for you, it goes for you all day long. He looks like he is trying to go over mid-off, but gets an outside edge to this length ball, which beats third man. Brings up fifty for Rana"
12.5,"Nortje to Narine, 1 run","short ball, into the ribs, he is half-ducking-half-pulling but he has sent it into a safe place for a single to long leg"
12.4,"Nortje to Rana, 1 run","full and straight, driven wide of mid-off for one"
12.3,"Nortje to Narine, 1 run","makes room to go big, Nortje cramps him up, he takes the single to long-on"
12.2,"Nortje to Rana, 1 run",short-arm pull to long leg
12.1,"Nortje to Rana, no run","yes, no, run-out missed. Extremely casual running. Length ball, pushed to point. Rana wants one, Narine doesn't. Then Narine wants it but Rana doesn't. Narine has given up, but the throw misses, and Nortje not back to the wicket in time to collect it"
11.6,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run",swept away to deep square lg for one
11.5,"Ashwin to Rana, FOUR runs","classy batting. Tossed up outside off, and he stretches out to its pitch and drives him inside-out over extra cover. Confidence, touch, elegance"
11.4,"Ashwin to Narine, 1 run","slow in the air, Narine tries the big slog sweep, but gets an inside edge for one"
11.3,"Ashwin to Narine, SIX runs","Ashwin bowls a legbreak, pitches it short, and Narine doesn't need a second invitation to pull him over the short boundary over midwicket. This was the wrong'un, but didn't turn at all"
11.2,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run","Ashwin stays wide, driven to deep cover for one"
11.1,"Ashwin to Rana, FOUR runs","Rana is not looking at the size of the boundary. He has premeditated a reverse-sweep, and has nailed it, sending it over short third man"
10.6,"Stoinis to Rana, 1 run","short ball, Rana looks to swivel and pull behind square but ends up front-edging it towards deep midwicket for one. Is a slower ball, and he has toe-ended it"
10.5,"Stoinis to Narine, 1 leg bye","slower short ball, Narine early into the pull, but will take the leg-bye"
10.4,"Stoinis to Rana, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, opens the face, gets a single to square third man"
10.3,"Stoinis to Rana, no run",nearly a third boundary as he opens the face but can't beat short third man
10.2,"Stoinis to Rana, FOUR runs","even better. Just short of a length, just outside off, and he makes room to cut this past backward point. The confidence showing now. Picked the slower ball too"
10.1,"Stoinis to Rana, FOUR runs","Rana says I won't let Stoinis bowl without some tax. This is full, on the pads, and he goes inside-out. In the air, but well between mid-off and extra cover. Not the best timing but going to the short boundary"
9.6,"Deshpande to Narine, FOUR runs","he has manufactured this one. Deshpande bowls a length ball angling into his pads, but he makes room and goes inside-out. Slices this over backward point"
9.5,"Deshpande to Rana, 1 run","slower ball, outside off, punched away to deep cover"
9.4,"Deshpande to Rana, SIX runs","lovely shot over the short boundary. This is not too short at all, but Rana plays the swivel-pull. Just jumps on to the back foot with the front leg in the air, and this is only waist high so he can pull him for a six"
9.3,"Deshpande to Narine, 1 run","quick yorker, leg stump, 142ks, dug out for one to short fine leg"
9.2,"Deshpande to Narine, 2 runs","stays short of a length, and this time he goes along the ground with the punch. To the left of deep cover this time. Gets a couple"
9.1,"Deshpande to Narine, FOUR runs","short of a length, wide, not high pace, and he stays leg side of it to crunch him over backward point. No half measures"
8.6,"Ashwin to Narine, 1 run","flatter, quicker, punched to deep cover"
8.5,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run","Rana shows familiarity breeds, well, not fear. Down the wicket immediately, right to its pitch, and drives him inside-out for a single to deep cover"
8.4,"Ashwin to Narine, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover"
8.3,"Ashwin to Narine, FOUR runs","short of a length, quicker, Narine throws his hands at it, gets a thick outside edge, and beats short third man"
8.2,"Ashwin to Narine, SIX runs","clean clean strike. It is a brave shot on big boundaries with field back. Ashwin has given him no pace to work with and tossed it up nice and slow, but he drives him over long-off for a six. All power through timing"
8.1,"Ashwin to Narine, no run","on a length, no turn, defended back to Ashwin"
7.6,"Rabada to Rana, no run",beats him with extra bounce on a shortish ball outside off. Rana pushes at it with his hands
7.5,"Rabada to Narine, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, pushed to third man for one"
7.4,"Rabada to Narine, no run","on a length, just outside off, left alone"
7.4,"Rabada to Narine, 1 wide","stays short of a length, and bowls wide outside off"
7.3,"Rabada to Narine, no run","short of a length, outside off, left alone"
7.2,"Rabada to Karthik, OUT","and Karthik has been sacrificed again. He has been doing well in the second half of the innings, but KKR continue to send him in early. Not a great shot. Looks to work to leg a length ball pitched outside off, and it holds its line to take the edge through to Pant"
7.1,"Rabada to Rana, 1 run","wide length ball, hit in the air, but wide of point for one"
6.6,"Stoinis to Karthik, no run","short of a length, just outside off, pushed to point"
6.5,"Stoinis to Rana, 1 run","short of a length, hit just to the left of midwicket for one"
6.5,"Stoinis to Rana, 1 wide","full and wide, too wide"
6.4,"Stoinis to Karthik, 1 run","short, stays low as Karthik pulls. Gets a single to long leg"
6.3,"Stoinis to Rana, 1 run","short of a length, around off, steered down to third man"
6.2,"Stoinis to Rana, no run","on a length, middle and off, defended"
6.1,"Stoinis to Karthik, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, worked to leg for one"
5.6,"Nortje to Karthik, 1 run","full and straight, worked to leg for one"
5.5,"Nortje to Karthik, no run","superb seam bowling to a new batsman. On a length, just outside off, Karthik pushes for the angle, but it holds its line after pitching. Beaten"
5.4,"Nortje to Tripathi, OUT","too quick for Tripathi. Yorker at 148.3ks with a new ball. This is high-quality bowling. Not very high-quality batting, though, as his feet are away, and his bat comes down late. Middle stump and off stump knocked back"
5.3,"Nortje to Rana, 1 run","short of a length, tucked away to short fine leg"
5.2,"Nortje to Tripathi, 1 run","fuller this time, driven down and along the ground. A single to wide mid-off"
5.1,"Nortje to Tripathi, FOUR runs","Tripathi manufactures a boundary. This is his speciality. He makes room early, gets inside and under a length ball and lofts this over point"
4.6,"Axar Patel to Rana, no run","slow through the air, drops on him, beats him in the flight, turns back in, hits him on the pad, but he has got himself outside the line"
4.5,"Axar Patel to Rana, FOUR runs","short and wide, a rare loose ball from Patel, and Rana takes full toll, pulling him through midwicket"
4.4,"Axar Patel to Tripathi, 1 run","angled in, and worked into the leg side"
4.3,"Axar Patel to Tripathi, no run","short of a length, he rocks back, punches this, but can't beat cover-point"
4.2,"Axar Patel to Tripathi, no run","on a length, slow in the air, defended off the front foot"
4.1,"Axar Patel to Tripathi, 2 runs","tossed up, driven in the air but straight of cover and wide of long-off for two"
3.6,"Rabada to Tripathi, 1 run","short of a length, no room, runs this down to third man for one"
3.5,"Rabada to Tripathi, 2 runs","another shot not out of the screws but this he has just cleared mid-off. This length ball cramped him for room, but he went ahead with the aerial off-drive"
3.4,"Rabada to Tripathi, 2 runs","short ball to Tripathi, well outside off, but he goes ahead with the pull and clears mid-on"
3.3,"Rabada to Rana, 1 run","short of a length, around off, this time he manages to place the defensive shot wide of cover for one"
3.2,"Rabada to Rana, no run","short of a length again, just outside off, pushed to point"
3.1,"Rabada to Rana, no run","short of a length, around off, pushed with an open face"
2.6,"Deshpande to Tripathi, no run","short of a length, 141ks, at him, defended with an open face"
2.5,"Deshpande to Rana, 1 run","on a length, outside off, he opens the face to get a single to third man"
2.4,"Deshpande to Rana, no run","short of a length, at him, defended to leg"
2.3,"Deshpande to Rana, no run","on a length, middle and leg, defended back to him"
2.2,"Deshpande to Rana, FOUR runs","short, but not with sting in it. Only about waist high, and he pulls this across the line and over square leg"
2.1,"Deshpande to Rana, no run","on a length, middle and off, hits Rana's bat high as he defends"
1.6,"Nortje to Tripathi, no run","superb delivery first up. On a length, just outside off, and then moving off the seam, against the angle. Tripathi pushes inside its line"
1.5,"Nortje to Gill, OUT","that is a bit of a nothing dismissal. Short of a length, just outside off, and he punches at it but neither is he looking to go over the infield nor bothers to keep it down. Caught at backward point. And today was a day when Gill looked in good touch"
1.4,"Nortje to Rana, 1 run","just short of third man. Rana throws his hands at this shortish wide ball, and the top edge flies nearly all the way"
1.3,"Nortje to Gill, 1 run","length ball, on the pads, clipped into the bigger side of the field, but Deshpande does well at long leg to keep them down to one"
1.2,"Nortje to Rana, 1 run","nor does the delivery. Short of a length, outside off, runs this down to third man for one"
1.1,"Nortje to Rana, no run","for some reason, Nortje starts off with an offcutter. Trying to play with the mind of someone expecting one in the ribs. No feet. Beaten outside off"
0.6,"Deshpande to Gill, no run","just outside off this time, pushed to cover"
0.5,"Deshpande to Gill, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Gill seems to have found some touch today. On a length, middle and leg, no swing, and he drives this wide of mid-on. Not a half-volley, mind you"
0.4,"Deshpande to Gill, no run","on a length, angling in, defended to midwicket"
0.3,"Deshpande to Gill, no run","shimmy down the wicket, Deshpande keeps the length short. Defended"
0.2,"Deshpande to Gill, FOUR runs","lovely timing. Short of a length, slight swing, and he punches this on the up and in front of point for four. That should make him feel good"
0.1,"Deshpande to Gill, no run","short of a length, wide, sits in the surface, hits the toe end of the bat on the cut"
12.2,"Thakur to de Kock, FOUR runs","swatted to the square leg boundary. Knuckleball, short of a length at middle stump. Swivels and places the pull to deep midwicket's left"

10.5,"Thakur to Ishan, 1 run","dropped at midwicket. Gaikwad to his right. Full ball on leg stump, flicked aerially and it seems Gaikwad's jumped up a little too soon and only manages to push it out towards long-on"
10.4,"Thakur to de Kock, 1 run","slower ball at a length on middle stump, check-drive down to lpng-off"
10.3,"Thakur to de Kock, SIX runs","lofted over the long-off boundary. Full slower ball outside off, gets to the pitch of that and keeps the full face offered as he extends the arms through the line. Mid-off was in, so the risk was cut out"
10.2,"Thakur to Ishan, 1 run","full and just outside off, mistimed drive to mid-off's right"
10.1,"Thakur to de Kock, 1 run","short of a length outside off, opens the face and chops to third man"

9.5,"Tahir to de Kock, 1 run","full outside off, driven to long-off"
9.4,"Tahir to de Kock, no run","lbw appeal turned down. Good length, a slider outside off. Looks for the ramp and cops that on the front pad outside off"

8.3,"Jadeja to Ishan, SIX runs",fifty with a reverse-swept six. A brute of an innings tonight from Kishan. Gets in position quickly to this full ball outside off and lofts it over point

8.1,"Jadeja to de Kock, 1 run","full on off stump, flicked to deep square's right"
7.6,"Tahir to de Kock, 1 run",short of a length and turning into leg stump. Glanced out to deep square

7.3,"Tahir to Ishan, no run","good length and going on with the angle outside off, beaten on the attempted jab off the front foot"

6.6,"Thakur to de Kock, no run","good length outside off, another slower ball. Check-punch to mid-off"
6.5,"Thakur to de Kock, no run",beaten. Slower ball at a good length outside off. Leans in for the drive but that spins past the bat
6.4,"Thakur to de Kock, SIX runs","caressed onto the roof. A short ball at leg stump, swivels to open up that area for himself and gently sends this hook onto the main road via the roof"
6.3,"Thakur to Ishan, 1 run","full outside off, mistimed slog along the ground to long-on"
6.2,"Thakur to de Kock, 1 run","good length on leg stump, clipped to deep square's left off the back foot"

5.1,"Tahir to de Kock, 1 run","good length at leg stump, punched to deep midwicket off the back foot"
4.6,"Chahar to Ishan, SIX runs","spanked to the deep square boundary. Whew, those hands are moving rapidly tonight. It's a short ball at about throat height and he's over it quickly before pulling viciously. It's on its way down but it's over the line and makes a loud thump on the advertising board"
4.5,"Chahar to Ishan, FOUR runs","slapped on the up again, this one through cover. Short of a length and a lot of room outside off. Gets his weight into this and throws everything into the punch on the up"

3.5,"Hazlewood to Ishan, no run","beaten on the drive. Good length outside off, pitches and holds its line as Kishan leans in for the cover drive on the rise"
3.4,"Hazlewood to Ishan, FOUR runs","over first slip. Cramped on the cut in the corridor as this gets big on him, but he takes it on with a cut anyway. Faf has his right hand stretched and both feet off the ground, but he's not close to getting a finger on that"

3.2,"Hazlewood to Ishan, no run","good length and just outside off, defended into the covers"

2.6,"Chahar to de Kock, no run","length outside off, mistimed pat into the off side"
2.5,"Chahar to de Kock, FOUR runs","trickles into the backward point boundary. Length ball pushed across him. Steps out and has a slap at that. It's off the thick outside edge, high, and clearing short third man. Sweeper hares across to his right but it's got enough"

1.2,"Hazlewood to Ishan, no run","good length and just outside off, defended to point"
1.1,"Hazlewood to Ishan, FOUR runs",crunched to the cover boundary. Short and wide outside off. He springs onto his toes and slaps this in front of square with a horizontal bat

0.4,"Chahar to de Kock, no run","good length and just outside off, tapped into the covers on the up"
0.3,"Chahar to de Kock, FOUR runs","oh shot! Super, super straight drive. A pretty good ball too. Good length and curving sharply into the corridor. He keeps his stride short and well away from the incoming ball and offers the full face to punch this past the non-striker"
0.2,"Chahar to de Kock, FOUR runs","thick outside edge and sneaks under Hazlewood's dive to the right at third man. Full outswinger this time and QDK chases that with his hands, feet rooted in the crease"
0.1,"Chahar to de Kock, no run","full inswinger curves viciously at middle stump, punched towards mid-off with the full face offered"
19.6,"Boult to Sam Curran, OUT","rips out off stump. Yorker headed for off stump as Curran walks into the off side again to try and go behind square. Nutmegs him, makes him fall over and sends off stump flying out of the ground for his fourth wicket"
19.5,"Boult to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","brings up his fifty. One to remember for Sam Curran. Short ball at middle stump, weight onto the back foot and pulls aerially to fine leg's right, giving him no chance on the small boundary"
19.4,"Boult to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","lofted over backward point. Smart stuff from Curran. Not so from Boult. Overpitched and wide outside off, sycthes under that and opens the face late"
19.3,"Boult to Sam Curran, no run","appeal for lbw turned down. Good length outside off, jumps into the line of that and looks to whip it over fine leg. Struck on the pads outside off"
19.2,"Boult to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","slower short ball at middle stump, hangs deep and puts the pull shot sufficiently to deep square's left"
19.1,"Boult to Tahir, 1 run","full and wide outside off, hangs back and chucks the hands at that. Thick outside edge trickles to third man's left. Tiwary sprints and puts in the boot. Curran says no to the second"

18.5,"Bumrah to Tahir, no run","yorker at middle stump, jammed down the pitch"
18.4,"Bumrah to Tahir, FOUR runs","oh hello! Short ball, slanted into the corridor. Arches into the leg side and expertly ramps this fine of third man. Superb timing on that"
18.3,"Bumrah to Sam Curran, 1 run","low full toss on middle stump, punched to long-on"
18.2,"Bumrah to Sam Curran, 2 runs",squeezed past point but sweeper cover dives to the right to stop this. Yorker following him down leg side but he manages to time this chop with an open face
18.1,"Bumrah to Sam Curran, no run","low full toss at middle stump, tapped to extra cover off the toe-end"
17.6,"Coulter-Nile to Sam Curran, 1 run","yorker outside off, jammed out to mid-off"

17.5,"Coulter-Nile to Sam Curran, no run","slower short ball at middle stump this time, and this slips through from under his attempted pull. Another difficult take on the half-volley for QDK"
17.4,"Coulter-Nile to Sam Curran, no run","slower short ball outside off, floats past him long after he's had a pull at that. Tough bounce for QDK who manages to gather anyway"
17.3,"Coulter-Nile to Sam Curran, 2 runs","full and wide outside off, drilled wide of the sweeper"
17.2,"Coulter-Nile to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","finally gets the ramp away. He's been itching to get inside the line and hit NCN to the fine leg boundary. Finally gets a length ball coming into him from the corridor, and he's in position and gets that away"
17.1,"Coulter-Nile to Sam Curran, no run","short of a good length and into the body. Mistimed swipe across the line, off the thick inside edge to fine leg's right"
16.6,"Krunal to Tahir, FOUR runs","finds the boundary with placement. Short of a length and just outside off, allows that on and cuts late to bisect backward point and short third man"
16.5,"Krunal to Sam Curran, 1 run",bouncer and a misitmed pull on the bounce to deep midwicket. Curran steps out at that and gets it off the low part of the bat
16.4,"Krunal to Tahir, 1 run","good length and just outside off, jabbed to extra cover's left with soft hands. Pollard misfields that and they sneak a run"
16.3,"Krunal to Tahir, no run",stumping appeal sent upstairs. Full and wide and slow outside off. Tahir plays the big slog sweep and is beaten. The back toe was out briefly but he's got half the foot back in as he gets back up from the sweeping position

15.2,"Bumrah to Sam Curran, no run","good length at middle stump, defended off the front foot"
15.1,"Bumrah to Tahir, 1 bye","narrowly past off stump. Attempted yorker is a slow full toss in the corridor. QDK gets a bounce that he isn't comfortable with to his left, looks like he's copped it on the leg before having to chase it down"
14.6,"Coulter-Nile to Sam Curran, no run","bouncer at a middle stump line, gets inside the line and has a hack from under that. Well beaten"
14.5,"Coulter-Nile to Thakur, OUT","taken at backward point. Slower ball, short of a length outside off. Arches into the leg side and wants to slice this over the fielder off the back foot. He's done by the slower pace and hits this high and simple for that fielder"
14.4,"Coulter-Nile to Thakur, 2 runs","just wide of extra cover. Good length and rising up in the corridor, his attempted back foot punch is aerial as the bat turns in his hands"
14.3,"Coulter-Nile to Sam Curran, 1 run","good length and in at middle stump, backs away and chops to backward point"
14.2,"Coulter-Nile to Sam Curran, no run",short of a good length and in at middle stump. Gets low to try and ramp it fine and cops that on the arm on his way down before it trickles out to QDK
14.1,"Coulter-Nile to Thakur, 1 run","just short of deep square. Short of a length just outside off, has a slug across the line and ends up getting under that too much as it climbs. Elevation, more than anything, and the fielder running in can't even get close"
13.6,"Krunal to Thakur, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to short fine"
13.5,"Krunal to Sam Curran, 1 run","low full toss speared wide of off, driven to sweeper off the toe-end"

12.3,"Chahar to Thakur, no run","good length and turning away outside off, past the jab"
12.2,"Chahar to Thakur, no run",nearly plays it on. Short of a length and turning away outside off. Looks to flick but gets that onto his back leg off the inside edge
12.1,"Chahar to Sam Curran, 1 run","googly, short and wide outside off. Tapped to long-off, off the back foot with an angled bat"

9.4,"Coulter-Nile to Sam Curran, no run","bouncer in the corridor, sways away to let it go"
9.3,"Coulter-Nile to Sam Curran, SIX runs","launched onto the roof over long leg. NCN is around the wicket, and he's short and into the body. Curran swivels and puts that away off the back foot"

9.1,"Coulter-Nile to Thakur, no run","short of a length at middle stump, looks for the pull and cops this on the body"
8.6,"Chahar to Thakur, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, deep in the crease to nudge this to fine leg"
8.5,"Chahar to Chahar, OUT","he's out stumped on the attempted slog sweep! QDK took the bails off and was clapping already. The umpire didn't even need to send in upstairs. Deepak Chahar looks oblivious to the fact that he's at least a few inches outside here. No scramble back to make his ground or anything. It's a full, slow legbreak tossed up outside off. He wants to slog through midwicket and it spins past the bat. QDK can barely believe his luck"
8.4,"Chahar to Sam Curran, 1 run","short and just outside off, punched to sweeper cover"
8.3,"Chahar to Sam Curran, SIX runs","tonked over deep midwicket. Full and in the slot, just outside off. Gets a stride out, gets low and slogs this cleanly in that direction"
8.2,"Chahar to Chahar, 3 leg byes",full and sliding into the pads. Deflected off the outside of the pad as he can't get the flick away and fine leg cleans up to the right

7.6,"Coulter-Nile to Chahar, no run","good length and just outside off, pushed into the covers off the back foot"

6.5,"Chahar to Chahar, no run","good length and turning away outside off, pushed to midwicket off the back foot"
6.4,"Chahar to Dhoni, OUT","thin edge and he walks. That is a lovely follow-up delivery from the young legspinner. Goes slower, goes wider, and extracts a bit of turn from this. Dhoni is back to pushing with hard hands with a big stride. Swishing, in this case, at the very end, to try and get a single at cover. It spins and rises and gets a bit of the outside edge that QDK takes smartly"
6.3,"Chahar to Dhoni, SIX runs",steps out and lofts it straight. Good length ball pushed through flat. He's down to the pitch of that and gets a nice clean swing from under it
6.2,"Chahar to Dhoni, no run","good length at middle stump, stride out and a poke to extra cover"
6.1,"Chahar to Dhoni, no run","full on middle stump, pushed down the pitch off the front foot"

5.3,"Boult to Sam Curran, 1 run","short of a length and onto the hips, uses the angle and glances to to deep square's left"
5.2,"Boult to Jadeja, OUT","straight to midwicket. Short of a length and just outside off, steps out at that and pulls. But this got tight on him and the pull comes of the toe-end of the bat and floats harmlessly for Krunal at midiwicket"
5.1,"Boult to Jadeja, no run","good length and in at off stump, defended on the front foot"
4.6,"Krunal to Dhoni, no run","full and angled in towards off stump. Stabs for the line, it rolls down the pitch off the inside half"

3.6,"Bumrah to Jadeja, no run","bouncer at an off stump line, ducks under that to let it pass"
3.5,"Bumrah to Jadeja, FOUR runs",good length and angled into the pads from around the wicket. Gets on his toes and uses the angle to tuck this fine
3.4,"Bumrah to Dhoni, 1 run",good length and angled into off stump. Defended into midwicket off the inside edge
3.3,"Bumrah to Dhoni, FOUR runs","shot. Back of a length outside off, weight quickly onto the back foot and this is sliding on nicely off the pitch as he punches it through cover"
3.2,"Bumrah to Dhoni, no run","good length and in at off stump, defended from the crease"
3.1,"Bumrah to Dhoni, FOUR runs","edged between keeper and first slip. Short of a length and skidding on low outside off. Looks for the cut and gets an under-edge on that. It wouldn't have carried, but the two slips are staggered and pretty wide"
2.6,"Boult to Jadeja, 2 runs","good length and into the pads, nudged to deep square off the inside edge"
2.5,"Boult to du Plessis, OUT",there's a sound and the finger is up! Oh boy. Overpitched and wide outside off. Faf's feet are rooted as he throws the hands at this to try and pierce the covers. It's a thin edge straight into QDK's hands
2.4,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","good length and just outside off, allows it on and stabs it to point's left. Kishan with a leaping stop there"
2.3,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","full inswinger on off stump, driven to mid-off"
2.2,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","good length and just outside off, defended to point off the front foot"

1.6,"Bumrah to Dhoni, no run","bouncer at the helmet, sways out of the way to let it go"
1.5,"Bumrah to Jagadeesan, OUT",taken at slip! Good length delivery landing on the seam and coming back into the corridor. Jagadeesan has a stab at it with static feet and ends up playing inside the line of that. Beaten on pace. It's dipping on the slip fielder but he takes it cleanly
1.4,"Bumrah to Rayudu, OUT","caught down leg side. Three short balls to Rayudu tonight, and the last one gets him. This one is at his left shoulder and this time he doesn't get on top of the bounce for the pull. It pings off the glove and is an easy take for QDK to his left"
1.3,"Bumrah to Rayudu, 2 runs","short and just outside off, gets the front leg in the air and pulls this into the ground to fine leg's left"
1.2,"Bumrah to du Plessis, 1 run","good length and just outside off, looks to punch through the covers, gets a thick inside edge to midwicket"
1.1,"Bumrah to du Plessis, no run",good length and angled into off stump. Solidly defended from the crease
0.6,"Boult to Rayudu, no run","short ball climbing across the corridor, rapidly drops his hands to let that go"
0.5,"Boult to Gaikwad, OUT","huge lbw appeal is turned down. Pollard reviews it. This looks very good on first viewing. A full inswinger pinning him in front of leg stump as his head falls over into the off side and he misses on the flick. Ultra Edge confirms there's no bat on it and tracking shows it's pitched in line and is hitting leg stump. Gaikwad off without scoring, and through the perfect set up from one of the game's best bowlers. Three away, one in, and that is a duck on return"
0.4,"Boult to Gaikwad, no run","good length and just outside off, drops it into the off side with soft hands and is sent back as he takes off for a run"
0.3,"Boult to Gaikwad, no run","beaten again. Good length and pushed across him again, making him reach out a little more this time on the front foot"

0.1,"Boult to Gaikwad, no run",good length and some curve into middle stump. Blocked on the front foot
18.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Shankar, FOUR runs","and that is the match and the fifty in one clean swing. Tyagi pitches it short, and he pulls him stylishly over midwicket"
17.6,"Stokes to Shankar, 1 run","short of a length, around off, dropped to leg for one"
17.5,"Stokes to Pandey, 1 run","slower ball, he recovers well, drives him down to long-on for one"
17.4,"Stokes to Pandey, SIX runs","the exclamation mark on a horror night for Stokes. A length ball, swinging into the pads, and he has nonchalantly whipped it over midwicket for six"
17.3,"Stokes to Shankar, 1 leg bye","full and straight, hits the pad, but angling down leg"
17.3,"Stokes to Pandey, 2 wide","slower bouncer, well down the leg side. Samson dives to reach this on the half-volley but can't prevent the bye"
17.2,"Stokes to Shankar, 1 run","length ball, chipped into the leg side for one"
17.1,"Stokes to Shankar, no run","slower short ball, wide outside off, and he is beaten by the lack of pace"
16.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, SIX runs",right in the slot. Half-volley. Pandey clears the front leg and deposits this over long-on for a flat six
16.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, no run","sharp bouncer, 134ks on the gun, but it is the carry. Pandey is surprised by it, and pulls out of the pull"
16.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, no run","short, quick, Pandey pulls this straight to shirt midwicket"
16.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Shankar, 1 run","short, not too high, pulled to deep midwicket for one"

15.5,"Archer to Shankar, no run","another short ball, and another ramp attempted. Beaten again"
15.4,"Archer to Shankar, no run","bouncer at 149.1ks, and Shankar is still looking to ramp this. Beaten"
15.3,"Archer to Shankar, FOUR runs","the best of the lot. Slower ball, picked early, in his slot, and drilled right back over his head"
15.2,"Archer to Shankar, FOUR runs","and now he goes mid-on. Smith is looking to attack and he takes on that field. Gueeses this will be short, so he makes room and short-arm pulls him over mid-on"
15.1,"Archer to Shankar, FOUR runs","and Shankar says he is in enough to be taking Archer on. He knows mid-off is up, and he sets himself to go over that man. On top of the bounce, and inside-out over that man. Clean swing"
14.6,"Tewatia to Shankar, 1 run","on a length, pushed through, worked away for an easy single to leg"
14.5,"Tewatia to Shankar, no run","slow in the air, looks like a wrong'un, defended to leg"

14.3,"Tewatia to Shankar, 1 run","full, on the toes, driven down to long-on"
14.2,"Tewatia to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length, punched to deep midwicket"
14.1,"Tewatia to Shankar, 1 run","length ball down the leg side, helped along for a single"
13.6,"Gopal to Pandey, no run","nice dipping legbreak, middle and leg, turning towards off. Defended to cover"
13.5,"Gopal to Shankar, 1 run","wrong'un, he seems to have picked it off the pitch, but has done so well for a single to deep square leg"
13.4,"Gopal to Pandey, 1 run","flat, into the pads, punched down the ground for one"
13.3,"Gopal to Shankar, 1 run","every time they give him air, Shankar chips them over cover. This time the deep cover is straighter to keep them down to one"
13.2,"Gopal to Shankar, no run",looks to punch this down the ground but can't beat the short straight midwicket
13.1,"Gopal to Shankar, 2 runs","on a length, middle and leg, he works this to leg with soft hands. The ball has just crossed the 30-yard circle, and thy come back for two"
12.6,"Tewatia to Pandey, SIX runs","lovely batting. Pandey is on a roll. Skips down the track again, and he has to advance a long way to get close to this. He is not right to its pitch but lofts him straight back over his head"
12.5,"Tewatia to Shankar, 1 run","slider, into the pads, worked away to deep square leg"
12.4,"Tewatia to Pandey, 1 run","down the wicket, Tewatia shortens the length, and he pushes him down to long-on for one"
12.3,"Tewatia to Shankar, 1 run","full, flat, driven to long-off for one"
12.2,"Tewatia to Shankar, no run","flatter, on a length, just outside off. Defended"
12.1,"Tewatia to Shankar, 2 runs",and Shankar keeps chipping the legspinners over extra cover. Gets two more
11.6,"Archer to Shankar, 1 run","short of a length, tucked away off the hip for one"
11.6,"Archer to Shankar, 1 wide","and another bouncer, this time at 144ks, and he has been wided for height this time"
11.5,"Archer to Shankar, no run","proper bouncer this time, 143ks, and Shankar gets out of its line"
11.4,"Archer to Shankar, no run","shorter, 142ks, rising higher than expected and beats his attempt to cut"
11.3,"Archer to Shankar, no run","quick length ball again, 148ks, just outside off, and Shankar just keeps this out"
11.2,"Archer to Shankar, no run","on a length, just outside off, 150.2ks, defended with an open face"
11.1,"Archer to Pandey, 1 run","on a length, on off, pushed wide of cover for one"
10.6,"Gopal to Shankar, FOUR runs","once again he bowls slow, full and wide, and Shanks plays the chip over cover again. This one goes much straighter than the last shot, but still wide enough of long-off"
10.5,"Gopal to Shankar, FOUR runs",Shankar breaks the shackles with a beautiful hit. Gopal tosses this up but goes too full and also provides him the width. He chips him over extra cover
10.4,"Gopal to Pandey, 1 run","on a length, around off, and he goes back to cut this to deep cover"
10.3,"Gopal to Pandey, FOUR runs","down the wicket, takes this on the full, hits it hard down to long-on where Stokes makes a dive to his left, but it slips through still. Unfortunate for Stokes"
10.2,"Gopal to Shankar, 1 run","slow legbreak, around off, and he uses soft hands to push this wide of cover"
10.1,"Gopal to Pandey, 1 run","legbreak, on a length, middle and leg, punched down to long-off"

9.4,"Tewatia to Shankar, no run","flighted outside off, pushed to cover"
9.3,"Tewatia to Shankar, no run","on a length, no turn, hits the pad, but headed down leg"
9.2,"Tewatia to Pandey, 1 run",punched down to long-on for one
9.1,"Tewatia to Pandey, no run","nearly bowled'im. Not the kind of ball that should earn a wicket. This is a long hop, and it stays low as Pandey looks to pull. Gets an inside edge onto the pad well down the leg side, and it almost rolls back on"
8.6,"Gopal to Pandey, 1 run","on a length, legbreak, punched down to long-off to bring up his fifty. An innings that has completely turned this game around"
8.5,"Gopal to Pandey, SIX runs","too short this time as he looks to go defensive, and Pandey is in great touch tonight. Pulled over midwicket for another big six"
8.4,"Gopal to Pandey, no run","slower through the air, around off, defended off the back foot"
8.3,"Gopal to Pandey, no run","down the wicket, Gopal pulls the length back, draws out a defensive shot"
8.2,"Gopal to Pandey, no run","that is definitely pad first. The umpire, though, calls it not out, probably because it is missing off with the turn. This is a length ball that he goes back to cut, and it kisses the flap of the pad before hitting the bat. But it has hit Pandey's pad outside off so they lose the review"
8.1,"Gopal to Shankar, 1 run","full, middle and leg, driven to long-on for one"
7.6,"Tewatia to Shankar, 1 run","full, outside off, drilled hard to long-on"

7.4,"Tewatia to Shankar, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to long-off for one"
7.3,"Tewatia to Shankar, no run","turn there. This dips on him, turns from around leg, takes the soft front edge towards cover"

7.1,"Tewatia to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, punched to deep midwicket for one"

6.3,"Gopal to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length again, cut away to the sweeper again"
6.2,"Gopal to Shankar, 1 run","on a length, outside off, punched to deep cover"
6.1,"Gopal to Shankar, no run","flighted legbreak outside off, pushed to cover"
5.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, SIX runs","wide length ball, Pandey gets the big front foot down, and dismisses this over long-on. Pandey looking in great touch"
5.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, no run","on a length, hit uppishly, but it bounces well short of mid-on"
5.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, SIX runs","this is not good enough to Pandey in this form. Short at 133ks, not even chest-high. No no no. Pulled over midwicket. The sound of the shot echoes around in the stadium"
5.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, FOUR runs","on a length, outside off, it gets big on him, but he finds enough power in the drive to clear mid-off. A seriously good shot"
5.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Shankar, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, he fends it down for a single"
5.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Shankar, no run","on a length, outside off, defended off the back foot"
5.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Shankar, 1 wide","short of a length, down the leg side, wide"
4.6,"Stokes to Pandey, no run","full and straight, hit back hard, but Stokes gets a hand on it and the deflection goes to a fielder"
4.5,"Stokes to Pandey, SIX runs","attemps a bouncer, but Pandey says your pace doesn't intimidate me. Doesn't even bothering transferring his weight. Pulls him off the front foot and over deep midwicket. Hits the boundary rope on the full"
4.4,"Stokes to Pandey, no run","on a length, middle and leg, pushed to mid-off"
4.3,"Stokes to Pandey, SIX runs",they are feeding Pandey as if this is his birthday. Leg-side half-volley after those short and wide gifts last over. Whipped over deep square for six
4.2,"Stokes to Shankar, 1 run","slower ball, full, outside off, pushed past cover for one"
4.1,"Stokes to Shankar, no run","full and straight, punched to mid-on"
3.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, no run","wide length ball, Pandey drives on the up, but it gets big on him. Mis-hit to cover"
3.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, 2 runs","short and wide again, and thankfully Smith has given him protection deep on the off side. Just the two this time"
3.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, no run","on a length, angling in, punched to mid-on"
3.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, no run","gets this fuller. Still short of a length, and punched to mid-off"
3.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, FOUR runs","short and wide again, and you don't want to play Pandey in. Cut in front of point again"
3.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, FOUR runs","short, wide, and despite the good carry, he has been cut in front of square for four"
3.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, 1 wide","wide down the leg side, but there is a flick as this passes the bat. Nobody else is excited about it. Apart from me, that is"
2.6,"Archer to Shankar, no run","short of a length, rising again, and he fends but manages to keep it down"
2.5,"Archer to Shankar, no run","short of a length, in front of his throat, fended down"
2.4,"Archer to Bairstow, OUT","Can he ever? A 149kmph length ball seaming in to take the top of middle. As good as his ball to Shaw earlier in the season. Top-quality bowling. Some ego from Bairstow too? Three balls to go this over, could he have played them with a low back lift? This one allows him a gate to burst through. And burst through Archer does"
2.3,"Archer to Pandey, 1 run","on a length, straight, risky risky single to mid-on, but Uthappa's throw is wilde"
2.2,"Archer to Pandey, no run","pace like fire. Carry like trampoline. Just short of a length, 149ks, and Pandey flails his bat at it. Beaten. Samson collects this in front of his face"
2.1,"Archer to Pandey, no run","short of a length, just outside off, fended to point"
1.6,"Rajpoot to Bairstow, no run","wide length ball, driven on the up, not timed well. Fielded at cover-point"

1.5,"Rajpoot to Bairstow, 1 wide","slower ball, gone wrong, wide down the leg side"
1.4,"Rajpoot to Bairstow, SIX runs","top edge to a length ball for a six. That is how it works if you swing hard enough. Another swipe across the line, and the ball is swinging a little. But the edge flies straight back over Samson's head"
1.3,"Rajpoot to Bairstow, no run","short of a length, outside off, crisp hit, but can't beat Parag at cover-point"
1.2,"Rajpoot to Bairstow, no run","Bairstow walks at him, and he slogs across the line of another outswinger. Lucky not to get any bat on it"
1.1,"Rajpoot to Bairstow, FOUR runs","Bairstow looks in good touch. This is a wide outswinger, on a length, and he drives it on the up, and in front of cover-point"
0.6,"Archer to Pandey, no run","on a length, 147ks, defended back. A wicket-maiden but for that edged boundary over slip"
0.5,"Archer to Pandey, no run","Archer ius letting 'em rip. Bouncer at 148ks, on top of middle, and he sways out of its line"
0.4,"Archer to Warner, OUT","and he has got him again. Never mind the format, the team, the colour of the ball, the colour of the jersey. Archer gets Warner all the time. And great captaincy to have that second slip in. This length ball seams away from him, takes a healthy edge, and Stokes dives to his left, full length, to take it. Archer to Warner in all formats this year: 7 innings, 45 balls, 32 runs, 6 dismissals"
0.3,"Archer to Warner, FOUR runs","he has nearly got his man. Just out of the reach of the first slip. Short of a length, seaming away, Warner throws his bat at it, and the edge goes over Tewatia at slip"
0.2,"Archer to Warner, no run",beats him again as Warner pushes inside the line of a length ball moving across him
0.1,"Archer to Warner, no run","short of a length, middle and off, seams away to beat him"
19.6,"Natarajan to Archer, SIX runs",that is an Archer special. Drops all nice little dinks and takes a wide full toss and sends it back over his head for a six
19.5,"Natarajan to Archer, no run",goes wide to defeat Archer's attempt at the ramp. Beats his outside edge
19.4,"Natarajan to Tewatia, 1 run","yorker, spot on, outside off, dug out for a single to mid-on"
19.3,"Natarajan to Tewatia, no run","shuffles across, Natarajan bowls a wide low full toss, and he hits this straight to extra cover, who is in tight to prevent the single"
19.2,"Natarajan to Archer, 1 run","misses the yorker, but the calf-high full toss ends with extra cover for just a single"
19.2,"Natarajan to Archer, 1 wide",changes the plan. Bowls a wide length ball. Goes too wide
19.1,"Natarajan to Archer, FOUR runs","Archer does what you do when someone is as good at the yorker as Natarajan. You ramp. Takes this on the full, and even adds a bit of a flick to the ramp"
18.6,"Holder to Archer, 1 run","full and wide, hit to extra cover again, and this time Garg holds on to it"
18.5,"Holder to Archer, 2 runs","low full toss, outside off, driven extra cover. Garg has a shy, and concedes an overthrow"
18.4,"Holder to Archer, 2 runs","nearly a yorker, on the toes, Archer gets an inside edge past short fine leg for two"
18.3,"Holder to Tewatia, 1 run","yorker outside off, squeezed out to deep point for one"
18.2,"Holder to Parag, OUT","smart bowling, smart catch. Parag leaves the crease, Holder bowls the slower wide short ball, taking it out of Parag's reach, who still flat-bats it and skies it. Warner back-pedals from mid-off to gets under it, but because he is still on the move, the catch is not clean. He juggles it as he falls over, and is lucky the ball has not bounced too far from him and completes the catch"
18.2,"Holder to Parag, 1 wide","goes for the yorker, but slides down the leg side"
18.1,"Holder to Smith, OUT","Smith gets no power. He is expecting the yorker, so he goes deep into the crease to turn this full ball into a half-volley, but manages no timing in the slog. Caught at long-on"
17.6,"Natarajan to Parag, no run",gets the yorker right this time. Dug out back to Natarajan
17.5,"Natarajan to Parag, FOUR runs","gets this yorker nearly right. Just about six inches short of the mark. Paraga looks to go over cover with an open face, and gets a thick outside edge over short third man for four"
17.4,"Natarajan to Parag, SIX runs","that is a lovely shot, and not a moment too soon. Natarajan goes for the wide yorker, and misses the mark by a foot or so. Paraga reaches it, is down on a knee, and hits this over extra cover for a six"
17.3,"Natarajan to Parag, FOUR runs","Parag corrects that. He knows Natarajan is bowling yorkrs, so he gets inside the line and down on a knee to take this on the full and ramp it over short fine"
17.2,"Natarajan to Smith, 1 run","pinpoint yorker, middle and leg, and all Smith can do is dig it out for one"
17.1,"Natarajan to Parag, 1 run",low full toss when looking for a yorker. Runs off the thick outside edge to square third man for one
16.6,"Sandeep to Parag, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, dropped to square leg for one. No attempt at slogging an over full of length balls"
16.5,"Sandeep to Smith, 1 run","slower ball, full, outside off, Smith has to abort his big hit for just a single to deep point"
16.4,"Sandeep to Parag, 1 run","slower ball, pushed towards deep midwicket. Played just a touch too hard to come back for two"
16.3,"Sandeep to Parag, no run","appeal for a catch at the wicket down the leg side, but this has come off the pad. Parag misses out on a leg-side gift as he is late into the glance"
16.2,"Sandeep to Parag, 2 runs","slower ball, on a length, on off, bunted wide of long-on for two"
16.1,"Sandeep to Parag, no run","short of a length, outside off, nicely timed, but straight to extra cover"
15.6,"Shankar to Smith, no run","nearly a yorker, Smith drives down the ground, and has hit it too hard to mid-off to be coming through for one"
15.5,"Shankar to Smith, 2 runs","looks for the wide yorker, just inches off the length, squeezed out for two to deep point"
15.4,"Shankar to Parag, 1 run","on-pace length ball, 128ks, pushed to deep cover for one"
15.3,"Shankar to Buttler, OUT","and Shankar adds the huge Buttler wicket to an already impressive night's work. Buttler looks to walk at him and across too to create his own pace. Shanks slips this wide, takes the thick outside edge, and is caught at backward point"
15.2,"Shankar to Smith, 1 run","slower length ball, outside off, punched to deep cover for one"
15.1,"Shankar to Smith, FOUR runs","gentle length ball, Smith picks the gap he wants and slogs it there. Square of deep midwicket he goes"
14.6,"Rashid Khan to Buttler, 2 runs","wrong'un, Buttler picks it, places it wide of deep midwicket, and comes back for two"
14.5,"Rashid Khan to Smith, 1 run","on a length, middle and leg, pushed into the leg side"
14.4,"Rashid Khan to Smith, no run","sees another full ball, and tries the big slog-sweep again. Seems to have picked the googly too. It just dips on him, and takes the inside edge onto the pad"
14.3,"Rashid Khan to Smith, no run","short of a length, no room, punched to cover"
14.2,"Rashid Khan to Smith, 2 runs","Smith is not premeditating to just play him out. Sees one too full, and slog-sweeps it wide of long-on for two. Along the ground"
14.1,"Rashid Khan to Buttler, 1 run","legbreak, down the leg again, worked away for one"
13.6,"Nadeem to Smith, FOUR runs","makes room, opens the face on the cut, hits this uppishly, but gets it wide of the man at backward point. Four runs for his risk as the deep cover is too far in front of square"
13.5,"Nadeem to Buttler, 1 run","too full, dragged to wide long-on for one"
13.4,"Nadeem to Smith, 1 run",makes room to punch this length ball to deep cover

13.2,"Nadeem to Smith, 1 run","quicker, short of a length, off the bottom edge for a single to cover-point"

12.5,"Rashid Khan to Buttler, no run","legbreak, quick, short of a length, on leg. Defended. Off the leading edge it goes back to him"
12.4,"Rashid Khan to Buttler, 2 runs","another wrong'un, a touch too short, and pushed wide of deep midwicket for two"
12.3,"Rashid Khan to Buttler, no run","wrong'un, tossed up, just outside off. Buttler has picked it, and defends"
12.2,"Rashid Khan to Smith, 1 run","short of a length, on off, punched down to long-on for one"
12.1,"Rashid Khan to Stokes, OUT","double strike. Rashid gets Stokes. A long struggle comes to an end. Legbreak, middle and leg, turns in, beats the inside edge as he drives, and deflects off the pads onto the wicket"
11.6,"Holder to Buttler, no run","sharp bouncer. Registers only 129ks on the gun, but it has got good carry. Buttler is beaten on the hook. They appeal to try their lick on the glove. Not given. Not reviewed"
11.5,"Holder to Buttler, no run","on a length, just outside off, pushed with an open face"
11.4,"Holder to Samson, OUT","Holder has his own back immediately. Slower offcutter, just short of a length, turns back and beats his attempt to dab it square. Top of leg. Look at how much this has turned"
11.3,"Holder to Samson, SIX runs","lovely shot. Bouncer, at his face, Samson pulls this with his face down. Doesn't even look up to see where it is going as he has deposited this for a huge six over midwicket"
11.2,"Holder to Stokes, 1 run","full and wide, squeezed out to deep point for one"
11.1,"Holder to Stokes, 2 runs","looks for the big shot over mid-off, but ends up slicing this over cover. Shuffles accross to get close to this length ball, but not close enough for that shot"
10.6,"Shankar to Samson, no run",looks to slog across the line. Offcutter. Beats him. Hits the pad. Headed down leg
10.5,"Shankar to Stokes, 1 run","wide on the crease, another slower ball, 112ks, on a length, outside off, opens the face for a single"
10.4,"Shankar to Stokes, no run","short of a length, 127ks, Stokes makes room but is cramped up by this. Hits this back to Shankar"

10.2,"Shankar to Stokes, no run","short of a length, slower ball, punched straight to extra cover"
10.1,"Shankar to Stokes, no run","looks for the ramp, Shankar bowls a wide slower ball so he changes his shot to the reverse ramp. Beaten"
9.6,"Rashid Khan to Stokes, 1 run","Stokes is shaping up for the sweep, but Rashid fires this quick at his toes. Just the single to short fine leg"

8.3,"Natarajan to Samson, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, runs this down to third man"
8.2,"Natarajan to Samson, 2 runs","incredible hit. Short of a length, not much room, and he goes over the top on the off side with a sort of a punch. Gets a lot of power. Deep point has to rush to his right to keep this one"
8.1,"Natarajan to Samson, FOUR runs","short, angling across, and he has pulled this from outside off and over midwicket. Not the cleanest hit, but he has picked his spot well"
7.6,"Rashid Khan to Stokes, 2 runs","Stokes keeps enjoying good fortune. He skips down the wicket, Rashid bowls a wrong'un, he goes towards deep midwicket, but doesn't get the distance. Shankar runs to his right. Does the hard work and gets to it, but can't hold on to the catch. Think it hits his chest and pops out, and he slips, which means he can't take the rebound either"

7.2,"Rashid Khan to Stokes, 1 run","reverse sweep, and he is not able to get it behind square, which he wants to do. Now he has hit this in the air and to deep point. And for the second time tonight, a Stokes mis-hit falls just short of a deep fielder"

5.6,"Shankar to Samson, 1 run","short of a length, straight, pushed wide of midwicket for one"
5.5,"Shankar to Stokes, 1 run","good bouncer with two deep men on the pull. He keeps it down, and takes the single to deep midwicket"
5.4,"Shankar to Stokes, no run","another short and wide, hit-me ball, but again hit straight to a fielder. Extra cover does the job this time"
5.3,"Shankar to Stokes, no run","short and wide, Stokes stays in the crease and cuts, but can't beat backward point"
5.2,"Shankar to Samson, 1 run","on a length, straight, driven back uppishly but wide enough of Shankar. A single to long-on"
5.1,"Shankar to Stokes, 1 run","Stokes skips down immediately, Shankar pulls the length back, and his pull bounces just short of deep backward square leg"
4.6,"Sandeep to Samson, no run","slower ball, Samson is not expecting it, he picks it off the pitch and defends"
4.5,"Sandeep to Samson, FOUR runs","even better. Beats extra cover to his left this time. If the last shot was Saturday night, this is dreamy Sunday afternoon. Leans into a half-volley, and drives it between extra cover and cover-point"
4.4,"Sandeep to Samson, FOUR runs","dismissive. Back-foot cover-drive on the up. Sharma has done nothing wrong. Inswinger, on a length, just outside off. Just that he is not very quick. Samson drives him hard, and wide of mid-off"
4.3,"Sandeep to Stokes, 1 run",makes room to punch this length ball to deep cover for one
4.2,"Sandeep to Stokes, no run","on a length, outside off, no room, pushed back to him"

3.4,"Holder to Stokes, 1 wide","wide on the crease, wide down the leg side"
3.3,"Holder to Stokes, OUT","that is a gifted run-out. And for what? A quick single? Holder cramps Stokes up as he looks to dab it, the ball has hardly gone off the pitch, but Uthappa wants one. Stokes sends him back, but he is slow to turn back, and Holder is alert, quick and accurate. What a waste on a night that he was looking so good"
3.2,"Holder to Stokes, FOUR runs","Stokes ramps, Holder follows him, hits him high on the pad, it goes much finer than he intends to, but just wide of Bairstow"
3.1,"Holder to Stokes, FOUR runs","the keeper is back for a change, and Stokes walks at Holder, who pulls the length back, but he still goes ahead with a flat-bat smack over wide mid-on. Not many keepers will stand up to Holder"
2.6,"Sandeep to Uthappa, FOUR runs","this drive echoes in the empty stadium. It is powerfully hit. Down the wicket, not close to its length so he just flat-bats it down the ground. Long-on is back, has only a few yards to go to his left to field this, but can't make it"
2.5,"Sandeep to Stokes, 1 run","Stokes has given up. He makes room to hit this straight to Rashid at mid-off, and goes off for the single. He is gone if Rashid hits, but he misses"
2.4,"Sandeep to Uthappa, 1 run","driven on the up and on the walk, wide of mid-off, but can't beat him completely"
2.3,"Sandeep to Uthappa, SIX runs","crisp pick-up shot. Sharma too predictable bowling just inswingers, and at his pace he is easy to line up. This one strays into the pads, and Uthappa is all wrists with the aerial flick over square leg"

2.1,"Sandeep to Stokes, no run","on a length, swinging away, punched to mid-off"
1.6,"Holder to Uthappa, FOUR runs","lovely cover-drive. Shuffles across to cover Holder's wide lines, and takes this outswinger on the half-volley to find the gap between mid-off and extra cover"
1.5,"Holder to Uthappa, 2 runs","short of a length, the extra bounce allows him to go with the pull over mid-on. Not the sweetest of connections but it clears mid-on"

12.2,"Ferguson to Kohli, 1 run","low full toss outside off, pushed to deep point for one"

9.3,"Varun to Kohli, 1 run","fuller now, pushed to deep cover for one"

6.4,"Ferguson to Gurkeerat, OUT","Padikkal has run himself out. Short of a length, pushed in front of square, this should be Mann's call, but Padikkal takes on a single that is not on.

6.3,"Ferguson to Gurkeerat, no run","on a length, just outside off, defended from the crease"
6.2,"Ferguson to Finch, OUT","and Ferguson produces the wicket immediately. These things always happen just to show up your captaincy even further. The extra pace from Ferguson, Finch stays back to a length ball, and it holds its line to take the edge"

5.1,"Varun to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length, into the wicket, worked to square leg for one"

4.1,"Cummins to Padikkal, 2 runs","short of a length, tucked away past mid-on for two"
3.6,"Prasidh to Finch, FOUR runs","Finch gets an inside edge and that beats short fine leg. He is shuffling right across the wicket, and for a moment the bowler must have thought the lbw is in play. The edge, though, dashes all his hopes"
3.5,"Prasidh to Padikkal, 3 runs","this time the length is pulled back, which means Padikkal gets under this too much, but he has hit this powerfully enough to clear mid-off"
3.4,"Prasidh to Padikkal, FOUR runs","Padikkal with another aerial off-drive. Kishna is just a touch too full, allowing him to play the shot. Over mid-off he goes"

3.2,"Prasidh to Finch, no run","on a length, outside off, the rare time that Finch has stayed in his crease. Defends"

2.1,"Cummins to Finch, no run",seam movement this time to hit him on the pad but Finch has got himself outside the line
2.1,"Cummins to Finch, 1 wide","Finch down the wicket again, and this is a wide down the leg side"
1.6,"Prasidh to Finch, 1 run","walking at him again, Krishna goes short of a length, pushed wide of mid-on for one"
1.5,"Prasidh to Finch, no run","appeal for a catch at the wicket. Not given. Not reviewed. Karthik likes it but Morgan doesn't. Finch is walking at him, the ball hits something on its way to Karthik, and it seems it is just the pad, and he has got himself out the line to avoid the lbw. Actually not outside the line. It is an umpire's call"
1.4,"Prasidh to Padikkal, 1 run","another big swing, gets a thick outside edge for a single to third man"
1.3,"Prasidh to Padikkal, no run","big swing and a miss. On a length, around off, moves away to beat him"
1.2,"Prasidh to Finch, 1 run","full, outside off, pushed straight to mid-on, but he can make the single because he has played this on the walk"
1.2,"Prasidh to Finch, 1 wide","Finch walks down again, Krishna looks to tuck him up, but bowls a wide down the leg side"

0.6,"Cummins to Padikkal, no run","on a length, straight, defended back to him"
0.5,"Cummins to Padikkal, no run",uppish but reaches cover-point on a half-volley. Early into the drive on the up. Lucky to survive
0.4,"Cummins to Finch, 1 run","full and straight, whipped away to deep square leg"
0.3,"Cummins to Finch, 2 leg byes","walks at Cummins, who fires this in straight and quick, but they get two leg-byes as this is sliding down leg"

0.1,"Cummins to Padikkal, no run","on a length, outside off, left alone, collected on the half-volley by Karthik"
19.6,"Morris to Ferguson, 1 run, OUT","full toss, cramps him up, and I like that they have risked the second even though this has been hit to long-on. The throw comes in right on top of the wicket, and Yadav is run out by inches"
19.5,"Morris to Ferguson, no run","slower short ball, does Ferguson in as he looks to cut it up and over. Beaten"
19.4,"Morris to Ferguson, 2 runs","full, swinging in, driven wide of long-off for two"
19.3,"Morris to Ferguson, 2 runs",cramps him on the attempted slog as Ferguson backs away. Skies into the vacant midwicket region inside the circle. Comes back for two
19.2,"Morris to Kuldeep, 1 run","quicker short ball, Yadav makes room and cuts this"
19.1,"Morris to Kuldeep, FOUR runs","length ball, on the pads, Yadav makes room and swings this over midwicket for a four. Slower ball, allows Yadav the time"
18.6,"Siraj to Kuldeep, 1 run","nearly a yorker, dug out for a single"
18.5,"Siraj to Ferguson, 1 run",looks like a hat-trick of successful reviews against S Ravi but he has got this one right. Ferguson looks dead for all money as he walks across his stumps but replays show he has got a bit of an inside edge. They lose the review
18.4,"Siraj to Kuldeep, 1 run","slower bouncer it seems, pulled over midwicket for one. Called one for the over"
18.3,"Siraj to Ferguson, 1 run",Ferguson down the wicket to swing this to long-on for one
18.2,"Siraj to Kuldeep, 1 run","short, cramps him up as he makes room. Bottom edge on the pull for a single"
18.1,"Siraj to Ferguson, 1 run","full, on off, dug out to cover"

16.3,"Chahal to Ferguson, no run","the teaser, wide outside off, looping and dipping, beats him on the drive"
16.2,"Chahal to Ferguson, 2 runs",down the wicket to chip this over midwicket for two
16.1,"Chahal to Ferguson, FOUR runs","wrong'un, outside edge, and Kohli beaten at slip. Many odd things in one ball. Ferguson plays inside the line of this, it doesn't turn enough, and the outside edge flies past Kohli's left"
15.6,"Sundar to Kuldeep, no run","slows this one down, 85ks, on a length, on off, holds its line. Defended"
15.5,"Sundar to Ferguson, 1 run","on a length, angling in, worked to leg for one"
15.4,"Sundar to Morgan, OUT","and Morgan perishes. I think the lure is the short boundary, but Sundar doesn't give him the length to pepper it. Morgan goes deep into the crease to try to pull this short-of-a-length ball, and gets no power into it because it is not short enough. Caught at deep midwicket"
15.3,"Sundar to Morgan, FOUR runs",slog sweep. Morgan keeps swinging. Between deep square and deep midwicket. Along the ground
15.2,"Sundar to Kuldeep, 1 run","on a length, just outside off, pushed with an open face for one"
15.1,"Sundar to Kuldeep, no run","full, straight, defended back to him"
14.6,"Saini to Morgan, FOUR runs","Morgan keeps fighting the good fight, though. Saini tries to bounce him, pitches it outside leg, and he pulls it through forward square leg for four. KKR have at least gone past the 47 or 49 that they had bowled RCB for in 2017. Not that it should be any consolation"
14.5,"Saini to Kuldeep, 1 run","short of a length, no room, Yadav manages to cut it in front of point for one"

12.4,"Chahal to Morgan, no run","slow legbreak again, defended to leg"
12.3,"Chahal to Cummins, OUT","Chahal is so good at teasing them out. Cummins has been tied up for so long that he throws his arms at the first ball tossed up. Chahal is a wily bowler. Not only does he toss this up over his eyeline, he bowls it wide of his reach. All Cummins manages to do is hole out to long-off"
12.2,"Chahal to Cummins, no run","full, dipping, middle and leg, hit back to him"
12.1,"Chahal to Morgan, 1 run","full, middle and leg, clipped off the toes"
11.6,"Sundar to Cummins, no run","make that four maidens. Short of a length, no room, defended back. No team had ever bowled three in one innings. Now we have four"
11.5,"Sundar to Cummins, no run","beaten on the outside edge. Cummins doesn't know what line to play. He is playing for the turn, and fails to connect"
11.4,"Sundar to Cummins, no run","on a length, on off, pushed back to him. A fourth maiden coming?"
11.3,"Sundar to Cummins, no run","slider outside off, and Cummins is beaten on the outside edge this time"
11.2,"Sundar to Cummins, no run","big appeal for lbw as Cummins plays the big sweep from in front of the stumps. Not given, but Kohli has reviewed it. That looks like a pretty good shout because Sundar doesn't turn the ball. Pitches middle, goes with the angle but no turn, and it just clips leg. Saved by the umpire's call"
11.1,"Sundar to Cummins, no run","short of a length, just outside off, pushed back to Sundar"

8.6,"Chahal to Cummins, 1 run","full, straight, turned past short leg for one"
8.5,"Chahal to Cummins, no run","another wrong'un, and this time he has got the lbw. Again it seems like going down leg to me, and Cummins has reviewed it this time. Pitches off, hits him in front of leg, and by extension it is missing. Two balls, two reviews overturned against S Ravi"
8.4,"Chahal to Karthik, OUT","big appeal for lbw but this is headed down leg according to the umpire, and me. But Kohli reviews it with one second to go. This is the wrong'un, Karthik defends for the legbreak, but it turns the other way ever so slightly. And RCB and Chahal have got it spot on. This pitches on middle, doesn't turn too much, just enough to beat his inside edge and it is going on to hit the leg stump"
8.3,"Chahal to Morgan, 1 run",swept away from outside leg for one
8.2,"Chahal to Karthik, 1 run","straighter, fuller, worked to leg for one"
8.1,"Chahal to Karthik, no run","this one doesn't turn. Slow in the air, conventional legbreak, Karthik plays an inside-out drive accounting for the turn, but gets an inside edge as it goes straight on"
7.6,"Saini to Morgan, SIX runs","takes on the short boundary. Morgan has walked out with intent today. He gives him a bit of a shimmy, Saini bowls the bouncer, and Morgan goes ahead with the hook, clearing the man on the deep square leg fence"

5.3,"Siraj to Morgan, no run",down the wicket to turn this into a length ball and drive straight of Morris at mid-off but they won't get a single because Karthik is on the ground trying to get out of the way of the shot
5.2,"Siraj to Morgan, no run","short of a length, no room, Morgan gets another bottom edge on the cut"
5.1,"Siraj to Karthik, 1 run","through a misfield, that is how. On a length, driven straight of mid-on, Morris gets a hand on it with the dive but can't gather it clean. They take the single"
4.6,"Morris to Morgan, no run","full, really full, Morgan backing away again, drives this straight to extra cover"
4.5,"Morris to Morgan, no run","beaten. Morgan is backing away almost every ball, and looks to open the face on this despite there being a slip in place. Misses"
4.4,"Morris to Morgan, no run","short of a length, no room, pushed to cover-point"
4.3,"Morris to Morgan, no run","swinging yorker outside off, and it squeezes under his bat"
4.2,"Morris to Karthik, 1 leg bye","Morris is in a celebrappeal as this seams back to hit Karthik on the pad. Not given on the field. RCB review. On a length, outside off, big movement after pitching, but only umpire's call on top of the leg stump. So it stays not-out but they retain the review"
4.1,"Morris to Karthik, no run","on a length, slight inwards movement. Defended off the front foot"
3.6,"Siraj to Morgan, no run","a second straight maiden. Just the on wicket this time, though. How disappointing Mo' Siraj. Short of a length, outside off, punched straight to point"
3.5,"Siraj to Morgan, no run","short ball, gets it high, Morgan keeps the pull down but can't beat square leg"
3.4,"Siraj to Morgan, no run","Morgan is backing away first ball, Siraj goes wide, and he gets a bottom edge on the cut"
3.3,"Siraj to Banton, OUT","Siraj on an absolute roll. Repeat of 2017 anyone? On a length, scrambled seam, and I am not sure this has moved away after pitching. Seems like Banton has just driven inside the line to edge it through to the keeper"
3.2,"Siraj to Banton, no run","wide length ball, pushed to cover"
3.1,"Siraj to Karthik, 1 leg bye","misses a leg-side half-volley, but I think this has swung in late. Leg-bye for KKR"
2.6,"Saini to Banton, SIX runs","lovely shot. Banton showing some of his wares. Short-arm pull as this short ball angles into his body. Goes flat over square leg for a six. This is only short of a length, and not a long hop"
2.5,"Saini to Banton, no run","nearly played on. Short of a length, jags back in, inside edge onto the toe"
2.4,"Saini to Banton, no run","short of a length, outside off, he looks to drive this on the up, but ends up inside the line"
2.3,"Saini to Banton, FOUR runs","long half-volley. That is some relief. He punches this through mid-on for four, all along the ground"
2.2,"Saini to Gill, OUT","and on a night when KKR need Gill to be circumspect, he plays an ambitious shot to make it nothing for 3. Gill is having a horror season: slow when quick runs are needed, reckless when you need to rebuild. This is short, outside off, and he plays the pull, only to top-edge it to midwicket"
2.1,"Saini to Gill, no run","shuffles across to drive on the up, hit on the inside half of the bat"
1.6,"Siraj to Banton, no run","short of a length, chest high. Defended. A double-wicket maiden"
1.5,"Siraj to Banton, no run","bowls in inwinger, aimed at the stumps. Defended from the crease"
1.4,"Siraj to Rana, OUT","Bluffmaster. Siraj has bluffed Rana. He has shown him the field for a bouncer, and slipped in the full swinging ball to knock him over. Rana's feet are stuck behind, he makes no attempt to get in line, and the ball swings back to make its way through the big gate"
1.3,"Siraj to Tripathi, OUT","they have strangled Tripathi. He has been given no width at all all innings. This is short of a length, just outside off, and he can only push at it with an open face. The ball swings to take the edge"
1.2,"Siraj to Tripathi, no run","gets width for the first time, walks into a drive, but can't beat cover-point"
1.1,"Siraj to Tripathi, no run","on a length, straight. Defended. No room given to Tripathi so far"
0.6,"Morris to Gill, no run","outswinger, outside off, and Gill ends up playing a defensive push outside its line. This outswinger has pitched, and changed its direction. Seam movement"
0.5,"Morris to Gill, no run","short, outside off, pulled to mid-on. No power in the shot"
0.4,"Morris to Tripathi, 1 run","inswinger again, a touch too straight, and clipped away for one"
0.3,"Morris to Tripathi, no run","yes, he bowls an inswinger, headed towards the middle of the off stump. Pushed to mid-off"
0.2,"Morris to Gill, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, clipped away to deep fine leg for one"
0.2,"Morris to Gill, 1 wide","wide down the leg side, and he has missed out on easy boundary. He tried, though, but couldn't catch up with it"
0.1,"Morris to Gill, no run",
18.6,"Sams to Neesham, SIX runs","Sams, as he has done all night, slips one in too full without meaning to bowl a yorker, and Neesham loves the slot ball. Slogs it over midwicket. And KXIP have won this without taking it into the last over"
18.5,"Sams to Hooda, 1 run","oh man. KXIP trying their best to take this into the Super Over, but DC say no thanks, we will let you have an easy one. Hooda goes for a big shot to a length ball, it seems like a slight offcutter, and he skies it to extra cover where Stoinis drops him"
18.4,"Sams to Hooda, no run","short of a length, just outside off, pushed to cover-point who is in tight on the single"
18.3,"Sams to Neesham, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, tucked away to long leg"
18.2,"Sams to Hooda, 1 run","length ball, outside off, driven to deep cover for one more"
18.1,"Sams to Neesham, 1 run","more blips on the way, though, as Neesham looks for a big shot down the ground and gets a thick outside edge for a single to third man"
17.6,"Axar Patel to Hooda, no run","down the wicket, yorks himself up, pushes this to midwicket"
17.5,"Axar Patel to Hooda, FOUR runs","that should be the shot that does it for KXIP. Just a little short of length, and he goes deep into the crease to whip it over midwicket and into the gap on the leg side"
17.4,"Axar Patel to Neesham, 1 run",sweeps this from around off for a single to deep square leg
17.3,"Axar Patel to Neesham, no run","quicker, into the pads, and this time he hits it back to Patel"
17.2,"Axar Patel to Neesham, no run","full, outside off, driven down the ground, but can't beat the short straight extra cover"
17.1,"Axar Patel to Hooda, 1 run","length ball, into the pads, worked to leg for one"
16.6,"Ashwin to Hooda, 1 leg bye","nearly a stumping. Ashwin bowls a legbreak, beats him in the flight as he skips down the wicket. Oh this is a wrong'un in fact. He has done him in twice in one ball, but he gets his pad in the way and it deflects out of Pant's reach"
16.5,"Ashwin to Neesham, 1 run","slows this one down, offbreak on middle and off, he waits for it to turn and works this to leg for one"
16.4,"Ashwin to Neesham, no run","full, outside off, 96ks, which is quick for Ashwin. Defended to cover"
16.3,"Ashwin to Hooda, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, cut away past point for one"
16.2,"Ashwin to Hooda, no run",opens the face on this but short third man is tight on the single
16.1,"Ashwin to Hooda, no run","carrom ball, front edge to the left of Ashwin, who puts in a dive to save the single"
15.6,"Rabada to Hooda, 1 run","wide length ball, driven on the up to deep point for one"
15.5,"Rabada to Maxwell, OUT","oh that touch was too brief. Maxwell goes back and across looking for a pick-up shot into the leg side, and Rabada stays on a length outside off. This is bowled cross-seam, and it sits in the surface a touch. He toe-ends a skier for Pant to take. Not without a dive, though, as these catches in Dubai have been tough to judge"
15.4,"Rabada to Maxwell, FOUR runs","that is some of the good Maxwell touch coming back. He is forever looking to shuffle across to Rabada, but this time he goes short and wide. Maxwell is quick to adjust and pulls this over mid-on for a flat four"
15.3,"Rabada to Hooda, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, runs this down to third man for one"
15.2,"Rabada to Hooda, no run","short of a length, outside off, extra bounce, beats him as he looks to open the face"
15.1,"Rabada to Maxwell, 1 run",Maxwell keeps trying the pick-up shot after getting inside the line to Rabada. Bounces well short of deep square leg
14.6,"Axar Patel to Maxwell, 1 run","flighted outside off, driven in front of point. Takes just the single even though the fielder in the deep is Shaw"
14.5,"Axar Patel to Hooda, 1 run",pushed wide of cover for another single
14.4,"Axar Patel to Hooda, no run","down the wicket, fired in, hit on the pad, but it is going down"
14.3,"Axar Patel to Maxwell, 1 run","stays back for a slow delivery, 86ks. It runs off the outside edge to short third man, and he responds to Hooda's call"
14.2,"Axar Patel to Hooda, 1 run","short of a length, just outside off, pushed to long-off"
14.1,"Axar Patel to Hooda, no run","quick, length ball, pushed to short cover"
13.6,"Sams to Maxwell, FOUR runs","Sams has been playing with fire this over. Two half-volleys before this were hit straight to the fielders, but Maxwell doesn't miss this time. Places this drive wide of mid-off for four"
13.5,"Sams to Hooda, 1 run","slower offcutter, Hooda walks at him a little and runs this down to third man"
13.4,"Sams to Hooda, no run","short of a length, just outside off, pushed with an open face"
13.3,"Sams to Maxwell, 1 run","slower ball, full, driven hard to mid-off, who is at the edge of the circle. And yet he is gone if Deshpande hits. He misses"
13.2,"Sams to Maxwell, no run","full, outside off, crisply hit, but straight to extra cover"
13.1,"Sams to Hooda, 1 run","a length ball on the pads, and Hooda plays a nothing flick in the air. He is lucky the field is up, and it just clears mid-on"
12.6,"Rabada to Maxwell, FOUR runs","Maxwell tried this earlier in the over, but gets the right line now. Gets inside the line of a ball sliding down leg, and flicks it fine of long leg for four. It has gone at a catchable height, but a little too far for a fast bowler to even attempt a catch"
12.5,"Rabada to Hooda, 1 run",unconvincing again. Rabada goes full fast and straight. Hooda pushes this uppishly through midwicket
12.4,"Rabada to Hooda, no run","oh this is fast and furious. Short of a length, into the body, Hooda fends, it hits him high on the bat and falls where a forward short leg would have been"
12.3,"Rabada to Pooran, OUT","Rabada strikes again. He gets a wicket at least every match. Pooran has gloved it while swaying out of its line. Rabada bowls this short, gives him no room, but when you are leaving one alone your Test technique comes into play. He doesn't drop his wrists fast enough, and the ball kisses the glove on the way through to Pant"
12.2,"Rabada to Pooran, FOUR runs","edged away to bring up his fifty. Rabada drags him wide with a length ball angled away from him. He looking to drive it down he ground, and the edge is healthy enough to fly wide of Pant"
12.1,"Rabada to Maxwell, 1 run","length ball, down the leg side, whipped away, but straight to long leg"
11.6,"Ashwin to Maxwell, 1 run","legbreaak, outside off. A touch too full and Maxwell goes for the slog. The lack of turn means he ends up dragging this to long-on for one"
11.6,"Ashwin to Maxwell, 1 wide","wide carrom ball, going wider, and called too"
11.5,"Ashwin to Pooran, 1 run","short of a length, into the pads, punched to deep square for one"
11.4,"Ashwin to Pooran, 2 runs","are they getting too cute now? Pushed with soft hands to the 30-yard circle, and they come back for two. Maxwell is gone if Sams hits direct. He misses"
11.3,"Ashwin to Pooran, 2 runs","soft hands to a length ball into the pads, perfectly placed into the leg side for two"
11.2,"Ashwin to Pooran, no run","short of a length, punched to right of Patel at cover. They don't run even though it has gone to Patel's wrong hand"
11.1,"Ashwin to Maxwell, 1 run","carrom ball, full, clipped off the toes for one"
10.6,"Axar Patel to Maxwell, 1 run",stays back to bunt a slow length ball to long-on for one
10.5,"Axar Patel to Pooran, 1 run","short and wide, trying to deny him that midwicket hit. He cuts it to deep cover"
10.4,"Axar Patel to Maxwell, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, worked to deep square for one"
10.3,"Axar Patel to Pooran, 1 run","wide length ball, driven on the up, wide of deep cover, but Maxwell shouts loud and early to say there is no two here"
10.2,"Axar Patel to Pooran, SIX runs","Pooran is not a man getting off the plane. He is flying this plane. Just slightly short of a length, and he goes deep into the crease to pull this for a massive six over midwicket"
10.1,"Axar Patel to Maxwell, 1 run","short of a length, middle and leg, worked to leg for one"
9.6,"Stoinis to Pooran, no run","good delivery. On a length, around off, and nips a little to leave him. Pooran, to his credit, pushes only inside its line"
9.6,"Stoinis to Maxwell, 2 wide","wide down the leg side, and Pant concedes a bye too"
9.5,"Stoinis to Pooran, 1 run","length ball outside off, opens the face, gets a single"
9.4,"Stoinis to Pooran, no run","fuller, wider, outside his eye line, beats him on the drive"
9.3,"Stoinis to Pooran, SIX runs","Pooran's rules are simple: you have got Rabada, Ashwin, Axar, please bring them back on. I am not going to let Stoinis and Deshpande bowl. Gets under a length ball and goes smack over long-on"
9.2,"Stoinis to Pooran, FOUR runs","man he is living life in the fast lane. Length ball, no pace to work with, mid-off in the circle, and yet he hits this hard and in the air. He has managed to place this one wide of the man, though"
9.1,"Stoinis to Maxwell, 1 run","a length ball, angling in, worked to leg for one"
8.6,"Deshpande to Pooran, no run","on a length, on off, defended with an open face. Somebody shouts a loud NO this time"
8.5,"Deshpande to Pooran, FOUR runs","yet another slower short ball. Off memory, every time he has tried that tonight, Deshpande has been dispatched. Over midwicket it goes this time"
8.4,"Deshpande to Pooran, FOUR runs","is that just the luck Pooran needs? Oh this one has seamed at 141ks in the ninth over. Short of a length, middle and leg, Pooran defends for the angle, but it jags back to take a thick inside edge that Pant can't catch up with"
8.3,"Deshpande to Pooran, SIX runs","slow down? Pooran doesn't know what that means. If the ball is there to hit, he has to hit it. And more power to him. Deshpande bowls short, not even chest high, and at that pace, it has to go. Over deep square it goes. Lovely hit"
8.2,"Deshpande to Pooran, no run","short of a length, straight, defended off the back foot"
8.1,"Deshpande to Maxwell, 1 run","short of a length, wide, punched past point for one. Maxwell doesn't respond to Pooran's call for the second. Looking at the fielder, Shaw, the second is pretty much on"
7.6,"Ashwin to Maxwell, 1 run","carrom ball, short of a length, worked into the leg side for one"
7.5,"Ashwin to Pooran, 1 run","nearly another run-out. This time Maxwell sends him back. This is to the right of short cover, so I think the single is on if you set off immediately. Maxwell doesn't. Pooran is gone for all money, but the throw is wide. Pant dives to take it one-handed and flick it in the same motion. He misses the stumps, and they take the overthrow"
7.4,"Ashwin to Pooran, no run","lovely offspin. Slow in the air, drifting in, dropping on him, not turning, hitting the pad. Just sliding down leg"
7.3,"Ashwin to Maxwell, 3 runs","carrom ball, Maxwell looks to punch it, gets a thick outside edge, and Rabada misfields it at short third man to concede two extra runs"
7.2,"Ashwin to Pooran, 1 run",pushed to deep cover for one
7.1,"Ashwin to Pooran, FOUR runs","lovely little cut. Just inches short of a length, and he is quick to rock back and cut this hard so as to give deep cover no chance to cut this off"
6.6,"Rabada to Maxwell, no run","on a length, angling in, pushed to mid-on"
6.5,"Rabada to Pooran, 1 run","wide length ball, driven uppishly past cover"
6.4,"Rabada to Pooran, no run","lovely delivery. On a length, just outside off, and beats his drive with some movement away. This is not just the angle, but some movement after pitching"
6.3,"Rabada to Maxwell, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, pushed to mid-on for a quick single"
6.2,"Rabada to Maxwell, no run","on a length, outside off, pushed to point"
6.1,"Rabada to Maxwell, 2 runs","he bowls full again, and down the leg side. Clipped away for two"
6.1,"Rabada to Maxwell, 1 wide",bowls on a length. Wide down leg side
5.6,"Ashwin to Maxwell, 1 run",pushes this to wide long-on for one
5.5,"Ashwin to Pooran, OUT","slower in the air, and Agarwal is caught ball-watching. He is livid with Pooran as he walks off. Pooran has pushed this wide of Ashwin, and sets off. It is his call as he is running to the danger end. Agarwal doesn't respond to his call at first, but sets off once he sees Pooran doesn't have brakes in his system. Too late. Ashwin's throw is good enough to catch him short? What's more? He seems to have hurt himself. He is limping off the park"
5.4,"Ashwin to Pooran, no run","on a length, drifting in, middle and leg, defended"
5.3,"Ashwin to Pooran, FOUR runs","oh starts off with a lovely cover-drive first ball. Ashwin overpitches for a change, and he drives it past extra cover. Easy as Sunday afternoon"
5.2,"Ashwin to Gayle, OUT","oh he still takes him out. To say that he has the wood on Gayle will be an understatement. Lovely old-fashioned spin bowling. Slow in the air, dipping on him, pitches on off. Gayle looks for the slog sweep, but he has been done in the air, and also off the pitch as it goes straight on instead of turning. Bowled neck and crop"
5.1,"Ashwin to Gayle, 2 runs","full, into the pads, eases into a drive, beats mid-on. Patel runs to his left from long-off to save two runs"
4.6,"Deshpande to Gayle, 1 run","slower short ball again, pulled to deep square leg for one"
4.6,"Deshpande to Gayle, 1 wide","goes full and fast, 146ks, but wide down the leg side"
4.5,"Deshpande to Gayle, SIX runs","slower short ball again, and Gayle unleashes the best of the shots. Pulls this from well outside off and well over mid-on for a flat six into a camera"
4.4,"Deshpande to Gayle, FOUR runs","more power. Short of a length again, outside off, slower ball, which means Gayle doesn't get all of it, but gets enough to clear the infield on the off side"
4.3,"Deshpande to Gayle, SIX runs","and now he shows the power. It is BOSS TIME. Deshpande goes shorter than the two previous balls, and this bounces only slightly higher than the waist. He pulls it over midwicket"
4.2,"Deshpande to Gayle, FOUR runs","that is four more. Universe Boss showing he has touch to go with power. Short of a length, again, down the leg side, and the short fine leg is up. Gayle tucks this away wide of that man"
4.1,"Deshpande to Gayle, FOUR runs","short of a length, gentle pace, outside off, almost gently pushed for four through cover. All timing"
3.6,"Sams to Agarwal, 2 runs","slower bouncer, Agarwal goes for it, and makes sure he pulls in front of square because the boundary rider is square on the leg side. Gets two for it"
3.6,"Sams to Agarwal, 1 wide",wide down the leg side
3.5,"Sams to Agarwal, no run","quick, on a length, no room, 136ks. Defended"
3.4,"Sams to Gayle, 1 run","slower offcutter, 118ks, on top of off, Gayle dabs on it, and Agarwal calls him through for a quick single"
3.3,"Sams to Gayle, no run",another bouncer. This time at 137ks. Gayle sways out of its line
3.2,"Sams to Agarwal, 1 run","top bouncer. At 144ks, At his head. Agarwal is pulling even as his head falls away. The top edge falls clear of square leg, though"
3.1,"Sams to Agarwal, no run","full, outside off, driven crisply, but can't beat the diving extra cover"
2.6,"Axar Patel to Agarwal, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to long-off for one"
2.5,"Axar Patel to Gayle, 1 run","Gayle shuffles across, and Patel slips this down leg. Just the single to leg"
2.4,"Axar Patel to Gayle, no run","stays on a length, outside off, and bowls this one at 94ks. Pushed to cover"
2.3,"Axar Patel to Gayle, no run","on a length, 92ks, outside off, defended"
2.2,"Axar Patel to Rahul, OUT","huge wicket. A rare Rahul failure. Patel showing why he is having such a great season. He sees Rahul skip down the wicket, and slows this down. The ball gets some drop too, which means he is not quite to the pitch of it. And then the lack of the turn does the rest to go off the inside half of the bat for a catch to mid-on"
2.1,"Axar Patel to Rahul, FOUR runs","lovely shot. This is dreamy batting. It is a length ball at 100ks, not too wide, and yet Rahul bends his back knee to create his own length, and late-cuts this for four"
1.6,"Rabada to Rahul, 1 run","misses out. The fine leg had come up and Rabada slipped down leg, but Rahul can't place the glance either side of the man. They get a single off the misfield, though"
1.5,"Rabada to Rahul, 2 runs","short of a length, angling in, worked into a gap on the leg side"
1.4,"Rabada to Agarwal, 1 run","short ball, gets big on him as he looks to get inside the line, gloves it away for one to fine leg"
1.3,"Rabada to Agarwal, no run","on a length, outside off, hits him high on the bat as he looks to make some room"
1.2,"Rabada to Agarwal, no run","short of a length, outside off, dabbed to cover-point"
1.1,"Rabada to Rahul, 1 run","on a length, angling in, worked to leg"
0.6,"Sams to Agarwal, no run","nearly a yorker, outside off, Agawar gets a bit of an inside edge back to Sams"
0.5,"Sams to Rahul, 1 run","full, outside off, driven crisply, but straight to mid-off. He takes the risky single, and makes it"
0.4,"Sams to Rahul, no run","full, swinging, near yorker. Hits him on the pad, but after taking the inside edge"
0.3,"Sams to Rahul, SIX runs","Rahul couldn't have asked for a better way to get into his innings. A free hit early into the innings. Sams goes to his trusted slower ball, but pitches it on a half-volley. Rahul holds his shape, and goes high over long-off"
0.3,"Sams to Rahul, (no ball)",oh no-ball because he has knocked the wicket at the non-striker's end. He has done it with the hand as it goes up for the delivery
0.2,"Sams to Rahul, no run","short of a length, outside off, Rahul looks to cut, but the extra bounce beats him"
0.1,"Sams to Rahul, no run","slight swing, but this is a full toss. Driven to short cover, and they don't run off the misfield"
19.6,"Shami to Hetmyer, OUT",perfect yorker at the base of the leg stump to knock him over. Shami has bowled excellently here to bring KXIP right back into the contest
19.5,"Shami to Hetmyer, 2 runs","another yorker nailed. Hetmyer digs it out, but they take on an overthrow for the second. Why is the throw needed?"
19.4,"Shami to S Dhawan, 1 run","looks for the outrageous reverse sweep to 145ks low full tosses. Easy into it, and the front edge gets him just a single"
19.3,"Shami to Hetmyer, 1 run","low full toss, but Hetmyer doesn't get enough on it. Just the single to mid-off"
19.2,"Shami to S Dhawan, 1 run","making room, but Shami doesn't waiver off the yorker length. Dug out for one to long-off"
19.1,"Shami to S Dhawan, 2 runs","shuffles around, takes this on the full, and places this into the leg side"
18.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Hetmyer, SIX runs","Hetmyer finally joins the party. This is how difficult it is to bowl at the death. Arshdeep misses the yorker by half a foot, but Hetmyer goes deep in the crease to take it on the half-volley, and hit him over long-on"
18.5,"Arshdeep Singh to S Dhawan, 1 run","yorker gone wrong, but it is still a straight low full toss. Hit hard but straight to deep midwicket for one"
18.4,"Arshdeep Singh to S Dhawan, 2 runs","Dhawan charges at him, Arshdeep bowls this short, and away from his reach. The toe-end cut goes past point for two. Back-to-back hundreds in the IPL. First time ever. He raises his arms in celebration"
18.3,"Arshdeep Singh to S Dhawan, 2 runs","Dhawan looks to undo the yorker with a ramp but he is early into the shot. The front edge goes softly down the ground, and Hetmyer initiates the second and makes it"
18.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Hetmyer, 1 run",another yorker nailed. Hetmyer gets a single to cover
18.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Hetmyer, no run",no fancy slower ball first up. The yorker. Dug out back to Arshdeep
17.6,"Shami to S Dhawan, no run","yorker gone wrong, and this could have been the hundred. Dhawan hits the full toss straight to extra cover. A little bit either side, and this is four"
17.5,"Shami to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","oh Shami. He doesn't want to be too predictable with yorkers so bowls one short of a length and into the body. Dhawan still manages to cut it, and cut it hard, wide of square third man for a four"
17.4,"Shami to S Dhawan, no run","Dhawan looks to give him the charge, but Shami still bowls a yorker. What an adjustment in length. Dug out back to Shami, who makes him rush back. In fact if Shami's throw is accurate, he gets Dhawan. He misses"
17.3,"Shami to Stoinis, OUT","yorker gone wrong, but when you err you err on the full side. That is what has happened, and Stoinis who is looking to go deep into the crease is surprised as this full toss gets big on him. He gets a thick outside edge for a skier for Agarwal to catch after running to his right from cover"
17.2,"Shami to S Dhawan, 1 run",Shami nails another yorker. Dug out with an open face for just a single
17.1,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run",lovely yorker first up. Just the single to long-on

16.1,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, SIX runs","Dhawan is going to take down the legspinner. Can't let him bowl the 17th unless he is of the pedigree of Rashid or Narine. And this is a risky shot, slogging against the turn of a wrong'un on a big ground. But he has got just enough to clear the boundary rider"
15.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to S Dhawan, 1 run",driven down the ground for one
15.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Stoinis, 1 run",beaten by wrong'un as Stoinis winds up for a big hit. Hits Rahul just on top of the flap of the pad and they take the run
15.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to S Dhawan, 1 run","Bishnoi has done him in the flight. He is down the wicket, Bishnoi gets it wide of him, and he ends up slicing it up in the air between cover and long-off. Hooda rushes in, but can't make it. Doing an interview on the sidelines. Jonty Rhodes says he heard no calling. That is not great"
15.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Stoinis, 1 run","full, just outside off, driven to long-off for one"
15.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to S Dhawan, 1 run","attempted big sweep, not hit cleanly, which is just as well as this falls short of deep midwicket"
15.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","Dhawan's placement is impeccable. Bishnoi bowls full, on his toes, looking to take his arms away from him, but he whips it out of the hope and between deep midwicket and long-on"
14.6,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 2 runs","on a length, straighter, pushed into a gap between deep square and deep midwicket for two"
14.5,"Ashwin to Stoinis, no run","full, just outside off, Stoinis's eyes lught up, and he swings without any feet. Beaten"
14.4,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, 1 run","picks the wrong'un, makes room, and goes over point for a single"
14.3,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","powerful slog sweep. Just a touch too full even though the line is good and wide outside off. Dhawan has got the right length to sweep, and goes wide of long-on"
14.2,"Ashwin to Stoinis, 1 run","wrong'un, picks it off the pitch, and punches it down to long-on for one"
14.1,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, 1 run","full, middle and leg, Dhawan sweeps. Just a touch too full to be sweeping but he gets the bottom half of the bat on it in time"
13.6,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to long-off"
13.5,"Maxwell to Stoinis, 1 run","full, outside off, punched to long-off. And good to see he has learnt his lesson. No converting ones into twos off a slight fumble"
13.4,"Maxwell to Pant, OUT","gets too close to this one. KXIP have bowled really well to Pant, who has been looking to take one of the spinners down. And they haven't given him the length to do so. Jumps out of the crease again to try to create his length, but gets too close to it, which means not enough elevation, and an easy catch at long-on"
13.3,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, 1 run","into the pads, and worked away for a single again"
13.2,"Maxwell to Pant, 1 run","full, into the pads, clipped off the toes"
13.1,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, nudged to midwicket for one"
12.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, no run","tries the slog to this, but is just short of a length, and it skids on to take the inside edge onto the pad"
12.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, no run","down the wicket again, beaten in the air again, and he ends up defending a wrong'un to cover"
12.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to S Dhawan, 1 run","wrong'un again, on off, turning away, cut away past point for one. Dhawan wants two. Pant sends him back again"
12.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to S Dhawan, SIX runs","Dhawan keeps the hits coming. Opens the front leg, goes down on a knee, and sweeps this length ball over deep square lg. All timing. That is 5000 IPL runs for Dhawan"
12.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, 1 run","another wrong'un, on a length, outside leg, turning towards middle, pushed to long-on for one"
12.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye",ridiculous lbw appeal to a ball pitched short and outside leg. They get a leg-bye
11.6,"Maxwell to Pant, no run","and he tries the big hit now, but Maxwell gets enough drop on the ball to beat him in the flight. The inside edge is thick, hits the pad, lobs up, but falls well short of Maxwell"
11.5,"Maxwell to Pant, no run","down the wicket again, but Maxwell stays away from his swinging zone. The push is not wide enough of Maxwell to get him a single"
11.4,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, straight, worked into the leg side for one"
11.3,"Maxwell to Pant, 1 run","down the wicket, Maxwell shortens the ength, and he manages just the single to deep midwicket"
11.2,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, 1 run","on a length, angling in, punched to deep midwicket for one"
11.1,"Maxwell to Pant, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, worked away into the leg side"
10.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, 1 run",shimmies down the wicket to nudge this length ball into the leg side. Dhawan wants the second but Pant sends him back. The call is clear and early
10.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, straight, tucked away to deep midwicket"
10.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, 1 run",this time he goes back to cut the slider to deep cover-point for one
10.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, no run","wrong'un outside off. Pant seems to be shaping up for the big slog, but has to abort as he reads this off the pitch"
10.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, no run","again, outside off and sliding away. Defended back as this is not short"
10.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, FOUR runs","slider, short of a length, and even if it is not too wide, the length gives Pant the time to punch this wide of the diving short cover"
9.6,"Maxwell to Pant, 1 run","full, into the pads, nudged into the leg side for a single"
9.5,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, 1 run","this time the ball turns from around leg to defeat a repeat of the last shot. He does get a single to square leg, though"
9.4,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","lovely batting. Short, quick, but slightly too far down the leg side. And again, Dhawan is not happy with just the one extra. He wants to tap this fine for four. And he succeeds too"
9.3,"Maxwell to Pant, 1 run",slight shimmy down the wicket to push this length ball down to long-on
9.2,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, 1 run","down the wicket, hit hard back at him, and Maxwell can't field this clean because it is hit too hard. They take a single off the defelction"

8.6,"Ashwin to Pant, 1 run","on a length, around off, punched down to long-on for one"
8.5,"Ashwin to Pant, no run","on a length, outside off, slight turn back, punched to the right of Ashwin but not wide enough"
8.4,"Ashwin to Pant, no run","full, on the pads, clipped to midwicket"
8.3,"Ashwin to Iyer, OUT","lovely catch. He is so confident Iyer has hit this that he is not even bothering with the stumping. This is a legbreak down the leg side, drifting outside Iyer's eyeline. He tries to clip this fine, but the ball turns back just enough to take the edge. Rahul is right behind it to accept it"
8.2,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, 1 run","wrong'un, starts outside leg, turns towards off. Punched down to long-off to bring up yet another fifty. Answering the voices that doubted him and called for him to be left out"
8.1,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","full toss, on the pads, and Dhawan goes down on a knee to sweep this to the right of deep backward square leg"
7.6,"Neesham to S Dhawan, 1 run","full and wide, and Dhawan drives it hard to wide long-off. The fielder there is wide so they will get just one"
7.5,"Neesham to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","slower ball, down the leg side, and the fine leg is square. Dhawan lets it come to him, and he flicks it fine of that long leg for four. That is 400 runs for him this IPL"
7.4,"Neesham to S Dhawan, 2 runs","on a length, at the pads, worked away to deep midwicket"
7.3,"Neesham to Iyer, 1 run","legcutter, on a length, around off, Iyer plays with soft hands and the edge goes wide of Rahul and falls shor too. He does get a glove to it to make sure this doesn't go for four"
7.2,"Neesham to S Dhawan, 1 run","down the wicket, Neesham shortens the length, outside leg and angling towards off. Punched to deep cover"
7.1,"Neesham to Iyer, 1 run","length ball, down the leg side, clipped away to long leg"
6.6,"Ashwin to Iyer, 1 run","full, into the pads, clipped away for one"
6.5,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, 1 run","full, outside off, chipped to wide long-off. He has gone in air, but he has not hit it hard enough for it to carry to the fielder"

6.3,"Ashwin to Iyer, no run","on a length, on off, not much turn, pushed to short cover"
6.2,"Ashwin to S Dhawan, 1 run","wrong'un, on a length, on off, turning away, cut away to deep cover"
6.1,"Ashwin to Iyer, 1 run","full, straight, legbreak. Worked to leg for one"

5.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, straight, tucked away to square leg for one"
5.3,"Arshdeep Singh to S Dhawan, 1 run","short, wide, cut away, but they have a deep point in place"
5.2,"Arshdeep Singh to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","bouncer, chest-high, so not a bad ball at all. It is getting big on Dhawan, but he rides it well, and keeps this down as he pulls it square for four. Just the lack of that 5-6kmph on it makes all the difference to this pull"
5.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, no room, he drops this at his toes, and this time they take the single"
4.6,"Shami to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length, no room, dropped at his toes, Dhawan looks up at Iyer if he wants to come through for one. Iyer doesn't"
4.5,"Shami to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","short, wide down the leg side, and Dhawan says he will take the boundary instead of the one extra. And he pulls him fine, helping this along"
4.4,"Shami to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","and they keep going after the bowling. Shami has just done him in with seam, but as soon as he overpitches, Dhawan drives him well over mid-off"
4.3,"Shami to S Dhawan, no run","this time Shami is unlucky. Short of a length, closer to off, and it jags back in to take the inside edge. Misses the stumps and goes to short fine"
4.2,"Shami to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","off the edge but Shami can't consider himself unlucky. This is short, this is wide, and Dhawan has all the freedom to throw his bat at it. Goes wide of the keeper"
4.1,"Shami to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length, angling in, no room. Played with an open face"
3.6,"Neesham to Iyer, SIX runs","oh a dreamy Buttler-like six. It is like silk. Neesham bowls a wide length ball, Iyer reaches it, opens the face slightly, and drives up and over extra cover. Smooth as"
3.5,"Neesham to Iyer, no run","full, middle and off, Iyer defends this back"
3.4,"Neesham to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, no room, opens the face on it for a single"
3.3,"Neesham to S Dhawan, no run","wide length ball, driven on the up, but can't beat the short extra cover"
3.2,"Neesham to Shaw, OUT","smartly bowled, and he has held his own pretty well. Not the perfect seam-up delivery, not the full-blown legcutter. Just slight rolling of the fingers on its side. Short of a length, outside off, and Shaw is looking to go over mid-off. Early into the shot, and the toe-edged skier is caught at extra cover"
3.1,"Neesham to Shaw, no run","gets away with one. A gentle loopy full toss, on pads, and Shaw has surprisingly played this straight to midwicket"
2.6,"Arshdeep Singh to S Dhawan, no run","good come back. Short of a length, no room, defended back to him"
2.5,"Arshdeep Singh to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","skips down the track, turns this into a length ball, and lofts him over mid-off. DC are a dominant side, and they are not going to let young bowlers settle into a rhythm"
2.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Shaw, 1 run","short of a length, he stays deep in the crease to pull it, and it bounces short of deep midwicket"
2.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Shaw, FOUR runs","fortune favours the brave. Bouncer, but just down the leg side, and Shaw knows now half measures. It goes off the glove but there is enough in it to clear the keeper"
2.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Shaw, no run","short of a length, outside off, pushed to cover"
2.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Shaw, no run","full and straight, good to see Shaw go after a ball that deserves it. No point fretting over what has happened last over. Driven crisply but straight to mid-on"
1.6,"Shami to S Dhawan, no run","full and straight, a touch too full, driven hard but straight to the mid-on placed wide"
1.5,"Shami to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length, just outside off, cut to cover-point"
1.4,"Shami to Shaw, 1 run","thick outside edge. Shami goes straight with a length ball, Shaw thinks he can slog this, but the ball holds its line, thus taking the edge. It bounces well short of third man"
1.4,"Shami to Shaw, 1 wide","bouncer, but a wide down the leg side"
1.3,"Shami to Shaw, no run","a nothing shot. Short, wide, but too high to be playing the orthodox cut. But he does play the orthodox cut as opposed to going up and over. The ball stops on him, and it is really hard to keep it down. It falls just short of backward point"
1.2,"Shami to Shaw, no run","wide length ball, room to swing his arms. Swing his arms Shaw does, but the ball seams back to beat the inside edge. Incredible that Shami gets seam movement in this format too"
1.1,"Shami to Shaw, no run","this one seams the other way, holding its line outside off, and hitting the outside half of the bat"
1.1,"Shami to Shaw, 1 wide","starts around middle, seams down leg, and Shaw thinks of the glance for four, but it goes down too far out of reach"
0.6,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, no run","uppish as Maxwell bowls another offbreak around off, but it bounces in front of Maxwell"
0.5,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, SIX runs","there is a hole in the Maxwell plan all right, but punctured by Dhawan. This is some shot. He has slog-swept a length ball from well outside off against the turn. And there is some turn. But it has come out of the screws"
0.4,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, no run",another drive towards wide long-off but intercepted by the short straight extra cover
0.3,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, 2 runs","fuller, outside off, driven to wide long-off for two"
0.2,"Maxwell to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","misfield at point. What a gift to Dhawan. Shoddy work. Dhawan cuts away a length-ball offbreak, but Pooran doesn't get down properly to cover the line of the ball. Beaten clean"
0.1,"Maxwell to Shaw, 1 run","length ball, on the pads, tucked away for a single"
17.3,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run","good length on leg stump, whipped to deep midwicket off the back foot to seal the win"
17.2,"Jadeja to Buttler, 1 run",full and into the pads. Flicked to short fine's left
17.1,"Jadeja to Buttler, no run","good length outside off, pushed to backward point"
16.6,"Chawla to Smith, no run","googly at a length outside off, looks for the late cut, under-edge onto the pitch"
16.5,"Chawla to Buttler, 1 run","full at middle stump, slogged to long-on's right"
16.4,"Chawla to Buttler, SIX runs","Jadeja takes it at long-on but it's past the boundary as he does so and he falls over. One-handed grab, his left hand. Superb work, but that wasn't redeemable. Good length at middle, steps out and doesn't make the pitch of that and it's a laboured attempted slog. But there's enough on it"
16.3,"Chawla to Smith, 1 run","full at off stump, pushed to extra cover's left off the front foot"
16.2,"Chawla to Smith, no run","good length on off stump, defended on the front foot"
16.1,"Chawla to Smith, FOUR runs","full and just outside off, gets a stride out and swings this away to deep midwicket's left"

15.3,"Thakur to Buttler, 1 run","full on leg stump, driven down to long-on"
15.2,"Thakur to Buttler, no run","good length and just outside off, pushed into the covers"
15.1,"Thakur to Buttler, no run","good length on middle stump, flicked to midwicket"
14.6,"Chawla to Buttler, 1 run","short of a length and wide outside off, cut firmly to sweeper"
14.5,"Chawla to Buttler, FOUR runs","Curran over-runs to his right at long-on. Full and into middle stump, uses the pace and angle into him to pick this up. Curran is headed the right way but that holds its line"
14.4,"Chawla to Buttler, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, slides on nicely and he cuts it past backward point"
14.3,"Chawla to Buttler, FOUR runs","drilled to long-off's right to get his fifty. Full googly just outside off, gets to the pitch of that and a flat lofted drive. He was looking for four there, not six"
14.2,"Chawla to Smith, 1 run","full and wide outside off, mistimed drive to sweeper"
14.1,"Chawla to Smith, 2 runs","full and just outside off, gets down on one knee and scoops this fine. Short third man cleans up to his left"
13.6,"Thakur to Smith, 1 run","short of a length outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
13.5,"Thakur to Smith, FOUR runs","ramped wide of leg gully. Good length outside off, skelter into the off side and gets low to get this ramp away and into the vacant fine leg boundary"

12.4,"Chawla to Buttler, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
12.3,"Chawla to Buttler, no run","beaten. Googly, short of a length and into the corridor. Past the attempted cut"
12.2,"Chawla to Buttler, 2 runs","good length outside off, slow but no turn. Buttler steps out and is beaten in flight, but manages to nudge this with soft hands into vacant midwicket"
12.1,"Chawla to Buttler, no run",good length and sliding into off stump. Punched to extra cover's right
11.6,"Thakur to Buttler, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven to extra cover's left. He dives and gets a hand on that, but can't stop the run"
11.5,"Thakur to Buttler, no run","full at middle stump, shuffles and flicks to midwicket"
11.4,"Thakur to Buttler, SIX runs",lofted over mid-off. Thakur goes full and outside off and he's set up deep in the crease on an off stump line. Then gets a bit of a stride out and a clean loft
11.3,"Thakur to Buttler, FOUR runs","lifted over point. Whew. It's a limtied-overs batting clinic tonight from Jos. It's not easy to score if you let them bowl at you on this pitch, and he's just manipulating the field to put pressure on the bowlers. He's picking the gaps so well. Short and wide and this time he hangs back instead of slapping in front of square. Waits on it and chops over point"
11.2,"Thakur to Buttler, 2 runs","short and wide outside off, hangs deep in the crease this time and slaps it to sweeper's right"
11.1,"Thakur to Buttler, no run","big appeal for catch behind from the bowler. No reviews left. Dhoni didn't look to animated on this appeal. Short and wide outside off, walks across into the off side and has a stab at this. It's past the sticker region of the bat. Nothing on Ultra Edge"
10.6,"Sam Curran to Buttler, 1 leg bye","good length cutter, angles into the thigh and catches him on the guard as he looks to flick"
10.5,"Sam Curran to Smith, 1 run","outside edge to third man's right. Good length ball angled in from around the wicket, holds its line as he looks to defend"

9.4,"Thakur to Buttler, 1 run","good length outside off, nudged out to third man on the rise"
9.3,"Thakur to Buttler, FOUR runs","oh lovely placement Jos. Pristine timing. It's a full ball at off stump, not much wrong with it. But he shuffles and closes the wrists on this to beat midwicket to his right. Long-on puts in a long sprint and can't get to it after a slide"
9.2,"Thakur to Buttler, 2 runs","good length outside off, walks at it and punches to sweeper's right"
9.2,"Thakur to Buttler, 1 wide","full and down leg side, can't get bat on it"
9.1,"Thakur to Buttler, no run","past the outside edge. Good length and in the corridor, opens the face on that to try and get it to third man"

8.5,"Hazlewood to Buttler, no run","good length and just outside off, defended into the covers"
8.4,"Hazlewood to Buttler, FOUR runs","chipped over mid-on. Serene Jos. Good length and just outside off, half a stride across into the off side and a gentle pick up to clear the infield with the full face offered"
8.3,"Hazlewood to Buttler, 2 runs","short and just outside off, shuffles and pulls firmly to deep square's right. Chawla tumbles and stops"
8.2,"Hazlewood to Smith, 1 run","good length outside off, looks to force the punch through covers. Comes off the inside half to mid-off"
8.1,"Hazlewood to Smith, no run","good length at middle stump, shuffles and flicks to midiwicket"
7.6,"Chahar to Smith, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punched off the back foot to sweeper cover"

7.1,"Chahar to Smith, no run","good length and just outside off, shuffles and punches to mid-on"
6.6,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
6.5,"Jadeja to Smith, no run","full outside off, can't get the drive past extra cover's outstretched right hand"
6.4,"Jadeja to Buttler, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, glanced to deep backward square"
6.3,"Jadeja to Buttler, 2 runs","good length on off stump, gets down and paddles it to fine leg's right"
6.2,"Jadeja to Buttler, FOUR runs",reverse sweep into the point boundary. Full and flat at middle stump. He gets down and that slides nicely into his arc and flies off the bat
6.1,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run","full at off stump, drives with the turn to long-off"
5.6,"Hazlewood to Buttler, no run","good length and just outside off, punched to short extra off the front foot"
5.5,"Hazlewood to Buttler, no run","good length and just outside off, punched on the rise to short extra cover"
5.4,"Hazlewood to Buttler, 2 runs","good length and wide outside off, reaches out and drives to third man's right"
5.3,"Hazlewood to Buttler, no run","good length outside off, chopped to point"
5.2,"Hazlewood to Smith, 1 run","good length outside off, shuffles and jabs it into the off side"
5.1,"Hazlewood to Smith, no run","oh that looks very good on the lbw. Dhoni says no then walks back to his mark and says okay, why not? The review is taken. Smith was shuffling across, looking to flick into the leg side. Was caught right in front of middle stump but Ultra Edge shows a murmur as the ball goes past inside edge. That looked very good on line because leg stump was visible as he was struck. Smith was seemingly walking back after they took the review. He didn't think he'd edged that but he survives. And that's CSK's review used up"
4.6,"Chahar to Buttler, no run","length and just outside off, tapped into the covers from the crease"
4.5,"Chahar to Buttler, no run",good length and swung into the corridor. Walks down at that and punches to mid-on
4.4,"Chahar to Buttler, no run","good length and some shape away in the corridor, defended off the front foot"
4.3,"Chahar to Samson, OUT","taken down leg side and that's three down in the powerplay once more for RR. Must be the fifth time this season. It's a good length ball down leg side, he looks to tickle it fine. Off the inside edge and Dhoni does well to get his left hand under this. As he takes a tumble, the ball wobbles tantalizingly in the glove but he's managed to keep it in"
4.2,"Chahar to Samson, no run",good length and swung away just outside off. Walks into line and defends
4.1,"Chahar to Samson, no run",beaten by an outswinger. Curves away from him outside off as he has a prod at it
3.6,"Hazlewood to Smith, no run",good length and cutting in at off stump. Defended to mid-off
3.5,"Hazlewood to Smith, no run","length and in at the stumps, nudged towards mid-on"
3.4,"Hazlewood to Smith, no run","short of a length in the corridor, defended off the back foot"
3.3,"Hazlewood to Smith, no run",good length and and in at off. Defended into the covers off the back foot
3.2,"Hazlewood to Uthappa, OUT","lobs it for Dhoni who takes easily. Uthappa jumps into the line of this short ball outside off and wants to ramp it to fine leg. Probably not expecting this length. It's up at the chest and he gets it off the high part of the bat, only managing to get it a couple of metres behind Dhoni"
3.1,"Hazlewood to Uthappa, 2 runs",chipped over mid-on. Full and angled into the pads. Half a stride across to pick this up with the angle. Not enough connection on it to beat Curran's sprint back though
2.6,"Chahar to Stokes, OUT","chopped on. More evidence of the slowness in this pitch. Short of a length delivery outside off, angled bat on the cut and it's right off the inside edge. Stokes is audibly annoyed"
2.5,"Chahar to Stokes, FOUR runs",crunched. Nails this one for sure. Walks closer into the line instead of making room this time. Allows him to line up the full and wide ball outside off and he drives firmly to mid-off's right
2.4,"Chahar to Uthappa, 1 run","cut uppishly to deep backward point. Short and just outside off, goes hard at that but can't find the gap"
2.3,"Chahar to Uthappa, no run","good length and just outside off, defended down the pitch"
2.2,"Chahar to Uthappa, no run","good length and just outside off, clipped to midwicket off the front foot"
2.1,"Chahar to Stokes, 1 run","lofted out to sweeper. Another miscue from Stokes. Good length and outside off, walks down the pitch and loses his shape"
1.6,"Hazlewood to Stokes, 1 run","good length and pushed wide across off, steps out and has a chop at it. On the bounce to deep backward point"
1.5,"Hazlewood to Stokes, FOUR runs","manages to get it fine but he wasn't in control. A good bouncer from Hazlewood, hurries him at the front shoulder. He wants to hook that but it's off the gloves"
1.4,"Hazlewood to Stokes, no run","short of a length and swung into off stump, hangs deep and chops it on the bounce to gully"
1.3,"Hazlewood to Stokes, no run","beaten. Short and across the corridor. Down the pitch, into the leg side, cutting from under it"
1.2,"Hazlewood to Uthappa, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, shuffles and jabs through point"
1.1,"Hazlewood to Uthappa, 4 leg byes","short and into the hips, shuffles across and tickles it fine off the thigh"
0.6,"Chahar to Uthappa, 1 leg bye","big appeal for lbw. Chahar manages to convince Dhoni to take the review. Dhoni didn't looks convinced. It's an outswinger and he's looked to lift it over midwicket. Swings past the edge and hits him on the outside of the front knee flap. Was it missing off? Just clipping the top of off says tracker, so that will remain umpire's call and they retain the review. Uthappa was going across the line and was done by the awayswing"
0.5,"Chahar to Uthappa, no run","length and just outside off, tapped into the covers"
0.4,"Chahar to Stokes, 5 runs",overthrows at midwicket. Four extra runs. Good length and just outside off with shape away. Drops it into the covers. Rayudu gets down at it and throws at the non-striker's end. Mid-on and midwicket were converging and he manages to get this to both their lefts
0.3,"Chahar to Stokes, no run","beaten. Good length outswinger wide outside off, steps out and throws the hands at it. Not close to making contact"
0.2,"Chahar to Stokes, FOUR runs","spanked through the covers. Short and wide outside off, sits up nicely for him and it's blazed through the covers"
0.1,"Chahar to Stokes, no run","good length and swung into leg stump, walks down at it and clips to midwicket"
19.6,"Stokes to Jadeja, 1 run","low full toss at middle stump, looks to slog that and gets it onto the pads off the inside edge"
19.5,"Stokes to Jadhav, 1 bye","beaten and then a fumble by the keeper. Slower ball at a length outside off, gets low and stuck halfway into a sweep as this climbs past him and dips on the keeper"
19.4,"Stokes to Jadeja, 1 run","doesn't give them even the thought of a second this time, Jofra. Full slower ball outside off, slugged along the floor to long-on's right and ad he's quickly onto it before unleashing a rocket throw on the full to the keeper. Jadhav had slipped and the second was off anyway"
19.3,"Stokes to Jadhav, 1 run","yorker length at leg stump, flicked out to deep square"
19.2,"Stokes to Jadhav, 2 runs","dropped at long-off by Archer. Some indifferent fielding from him there the last few overs, run-out aside. Slower ball at a length outside off, looks to launch this straight on the rise and Archer is under it with a reverse-cup. Almost too soft with the attempt, the balls just bursts through"
19.1,"Stokes to Jadeja, 1 run","short and wide outside off, steps out and drives straight to extra cover"
18.6,"Archer to Jadeja, 1 run",short and up at the throat. Feet off the ground again as he rides the bounce and drops this into the square leg region
18.5,"Archer to Jadeja, FOUR runs",nudged to fine leg. A short ball headed for his under-arm and he leaps off the floor and fends this fine with the angle
18.4,"Archer to Jadeja, FOUR runs","lifted past mid-off. A length ball in at middle stump, clears the front leg, offers the full face and lofts it between bowler and mid-off"
18.3,"Archer to Jadhav, 1 run","good length and into the stumps, backs away and chops into the off side"
18.2,"Archer to Jadhav, no run",beaten by legcutter. Lovely ball. Lands it on a length outside off and goes past the outside edge as he has a swish at this
18.1,"Archer to Jadeja, 1 run","yorker at off stump, jammed into the covers"
17.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Jadhav, no run","short and rising outside off, looks for the upper cut but is beaten as that is rapidly past him"
17.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Jadhav, no run","lifts past his face and he can't even get a shot away at this. Short ball outside off, walks down the pitch and lets it go"
17.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Dhoni, 1 run, OUT","run-out appeal at the striker's end. Another fumble at long-off from Jofra as CSK looks to punch a second. His throw to the striker's end is a good one though. Only slightly to Samson's right who grabs the ball and whips the bails off. Dhoni's grounded the bat but it's on the line as the bails come off, nothing behind it. It was a full delivery outside off, driven firmly in Archer's direction and they looked to run on the misfield. Dhoni hadn't run the first one hard, merely trotted across. He was caught off guard as Jadeja pushed him for the second"
17.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Dhoni, FOUR runs","Archer misfields a straightforward take at long-off. Low full toss outside off, driven firmly to Archer's left and he fumbles and lets this between his legs after making the ground"
17.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Jadeja, 1 leg bye","appeal for lbw is turned down  and they don't review. Length ball on leg stump, beaten on the attempted whip into the leg side and struck on the back thigh. That pitched outside leg"
17.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Dhoni, 1 run","low full toss on middle stump, mistimed slog down to long-on"
16.6,"Archer to Dhoni, 1 run",short and rising up the body. Shuffles and hurriedly fends this into the square leg region
16.5,"Archer to Dhoni, no run","short and wide outside off, left alone"
16.4,"Archer to Jadeja, 1 run","full and into the toes, whipped out to deep square"
16.3,"Archer to Jadeja, no run",past the edge. Good length and in the corridor. Leans in to drive through cover and is caught inside the line
16.2,"Archer to Dhoni, 1 run","yorker wide outside off, squeezed down to third man off the outside edge"
16.1,"Archer to Jadeja, 1 run",leading edge falls short of extra cover. Low full toss angled into middle stump and he closes the face too soon on the flick. Buttler has a shy at the non-striker's end and a direct hit would have been close
15.6,"Stokes to Jadeja, 1 run","slower length ball outside off, sliced straight to short third man"
15.5,"Stokes to Dhoni, 1 run","good length outside off, punched to sweeper cover"
15.4,"Stokes to Dhoni, 2 runs",good length and cramping him at middle stump. Hurriedly stabs it down to long-on with soft hands and Smith does well to make the ground and stop them from thinking of the second and then he misfields and they get it anyway
15.3,"Stokes to Jadeja, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length and just outside off, jabbed to short third"
15.2,"Stokes to Dhoni, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep square off the back foot"
15.1,"Stokes to Jadeja, 1 leg bye",big appeal for lbw. Slower good length ball raps him in front of middle as he gets forward to defend. Pitching outside leg? Yes. Smart choice not to review that
14.6,"Tewatia to Jadeja, 1 run","short and sliding on low outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
14.5,"Tewatia to Jadeja, no run",good length and turning into offs stump. Defended into the covers
14.4,"Tewatia to Dhoni, 1 run",good length and skidding on at off stump. Backs into the leg side and punches to long-on
14.3,"Tewatia to Dhoni, no run","just short of extra cover. Dipping length ball outside off, reaches out and pushes at that with hard hands"
14.2,"Tewatia to Jadeja, 1 run","googly, short and wide outside off. Cut to sweeper's right"
14.1,"Tewatia to Dhoni, 1 run",good length and skids on low at middle stump. Punched to long-on off the back foot
13.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Jadeja, FOUR runs","expertly steered to third man's left. Short and across the corridor, hangs inside the line of that and places the late cut to perfection"
13.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Jadeja, FOUR runs","outside edge sprints away to third man's right. Good length and angled across the corridor. Pokes at it, inside the line and the edge is fine enough"
13.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Jadeja, 1 wide","short and down leg side, left alone"
13.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Dhoni, 1 run","good length and into middle stump, pushed towards long-on off the back foot"
13.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Dhoni, no run","short and wide outside off, beaten on the cut"
13.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Dhoni, FOUR runs","drilled to sweeper's right. First boundary in 50 balls. Full and just outside off, he stays tall and drives firmly off the front foot to beat extra cover to the left"
13.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Dhoni, no run","good length at off stump, punched to extra cover off the back foot"
12.6,"Gopal to Dhoni, 1 run","short of a length and outside off, punched to sweeper cover"
12.5,"Gopal to Dhoni, no run","good length at off stump, gets forward and nudges to point with the turn"
12.4,"Gopal to Dhoni, no run",good length and loopy on an off stump line. Defended watchfully off the front foot
12.3,"Gopal to Jadeja, 1 run","googly, good length and away from off stump. Punched to long-on off the back foot"
12.2,"Gopal to Jadeja, no run","googly, short of a length and just outside off. Defended to point off the back foot"
12.1,"Gopal to Dhoni, 1 run","good length and turning away outside off, gets forward and jabs to backward point's left off the outside half"
11.6,"Tewatia to Jadeja, 2 runs","full and just outside off, gets low and behind that to paddle to fine leg's left"
11.5,"Tewatia to Jadeja, no run",short of a length and pushed across the corridor. mistimed punch to extra cover
11.4,"Tewatia to Jadeja, no run",good length and pushed across the corridor. Steers the late cut straight to short third man
11.3,"Tewatia to Jadeja, 2 runs",short of a length and turning away outside off. Allows it on and chops to sweeper's right
11.2,"Tewatia to Jadeja, no run",full and just outside off. Watchfully defended down the pitch
11.1,"Tewatia to Dhoni, 3 runs","good length and just outside off, jabbed to backward point and a misfield from Tyagi turns one into three. He over-ran it to his right"
10.6,"Gopal to Dhoni, 1 run","googly, good length and into leg stump. Punched to long-on off the back foot"
10.5,"Gopal to Jadeja, 1 run","googly at a good length, watches it closely and rides the bounce to jab this between slip and short third off the back foot"
10.4,"Gopal to Jadeja, 2 runs",just past Miller's outstretched hands at midwicket. Googly dropped short and fetched from outside off with a pull. Off the toe-end and safely to long-on's left in the end
10.3,"Gopal to Jadeja, no run","good length on off stump, defended on the front foot"
10.2,"Gopal to Jadeja, no run",good length and turning away from leg stump. Gets forward and stabs it to midwicket's right
10.1,"Gopal to Dhoni, 1 run","googly, short of a length and into leg stump, pulled to deep midwicket"
9.6,"Tewatia to Rayudu, OUT","Samson settles under this top-edge and takes it. Front-of-the-hand quicker one, at a length and in at leg stump. Looks for the sweep and is through it early. It hands in front of short fine and Samson takes it easily with a couple of steps to the left"
9.5,"Tewatia to Rayudu, no run","good length outside off, steps out and doesn't make the pitch of that. Driven back to the bowler"
9.4,"Tewatia to Dhoni, 1 run","full outside off, driven with the turn to long-off"
9.3,"Tewatia to Dhoni, no run","tossed up at middle stump, defended down the pitch off the front foot"
9.2,"Tewatia to Dhoni, no run","loopy and full at 78.9kph on middle stump, big stride out before jabbing to the bowler's left"
9.1,"Tewatia to Dhoni, no run","tossed up outside off, jabbed straight to extra cover"
8.6,"Gopal to Dhoni, 1 run","tossed up full outside off, keeps the front leg away as he reaches out and drives to sweeper cover"
8.5,"Gopal to Rayudu, 1 run",short of a length and turning away slowly outside off. A laboured pull down to long-on
8.4,"Gopal to Rayudu, no run",good length and turning away outside off. Onto the back foot as he opens the face and defends to point
8.3,"Gopal to Rayudu, no run","big appeal for lbw is given. A chat between the batsmen and Rayudu reviews. Probably no bat on that, the only thing that can save him is the googly spinning past leg stump. He was beaten on the inside edge looking to defend on the front foot and was caught on a middle and leg stump line. A flat line on Ultra Edge. And ball tracking has the ball spinning past leg stump. The decision will be overturned"
8.2,"Gopal to Sam Curran, OUT",taken at long-off. This is smart bowling from a bowler in full control against the batsman. Knew Curran would be itching to step down the track and pushed his googly wide outside off and just short of a good length. Curran is reaching out for it in the end and it's a simple chip for Buttler to hold at long-off
8.1,"Gopal to Sam Curran, 2 runs",sounds like a dropped catch. But it was off the top edge and near impossible for the keeper to react to his left. Googly landing at a length outside off and he was looking for the sweep
7.6,"Tewatia to Sam Curran, 1 run","good length and pushed across the corridor, onto the back foot and punched to deep midwicket"
7.5,"Tewatia to Rayudu, 1 run","full outside off, pushed into the covers with soft hands"
7.4,"Tewatia to Rayudu, no run","nice dipping legbreak outside off, draws him forward and takes the outside edge to short third man as he gets forward for the drive"
7.3,"Tewatia to Sam Curran, 1 run","good length, turning away from middle. Punched to long-on off the back foot"
7.2,"Tewatia to Rayudu, 1 run",short and front-of-the-hand outside off. Rayudu steps out and only manages to slice it for short third man to run backwards and grab that
7.2,"Tewatia to Rayudu, (no ball)",good length ball slips out of his hand and is very very wide outside off. The siren also goes off which means he has overstepped
7.1,"Tewatia to Sam Curran, 1 run","googly, short of a length and just outside off. Pushed into the covers"
6.6,"Gopal to Sam Curran, 1 run","short and sliding away outside off, under-edge on the cut"
6.5,"Gopal to Sam Curran, no run",leading edge into the covers. Looks to flick this googly from outside off but he's well safe
6.4,"Gopal to Sam Curran, no run",short and pushed across off stump. Cut off the back foot but can't beat Smith to the right at extra cover
6.3,"Gopal to Sam Curran, no run","good length, a googly outside off. Pushed into the covers off the back foot"
6.2,"Gopal to Rayudu, 1 run","tossed up outside off, driven with the turn to long-off"
6.1,"Gopal to Rayudu, no run","good length and just outside off, turning away. Punched to point off the back foot"
5.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Rayudu, 1 run","full and just outside off, jammed to mid-on's right"
5.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Rayudu, no run","low full toss wide outside off, sliced straight to backward point"
5.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Rayudu, no run","beaten on the drive. Good length ball wide outside off, looks to go flat-batted through the off side on the front foot"
5.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Rayudu, no run","good length outside off, left alone"
5.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Sam Curran, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to deep backward point with the angle"
5.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Sam Curran, no run","good length and just outside off, defended into the covers off the back foot"
4.6,"Stokes to Rayudu, FOUR runs",only a matter of time before Rayudu steps out. His favourite release shot - a jump down the pitch to lift this length ball over mid-off from outside off stump. Stokes slides on nicely for such a shot
4.5,"Stokes to Rayudu, no run","good length and into leg stump, defended to midwicket with the angle"
4.4,"Stokes to Rayudu, FOUR runs","nicely timed. Short ball up at the chest, swivels on the back foot and pulls into the ground, firmly and to deep square's right"
4.3,"Stokes to Rayudu, no run","good length and just outside off, defended to point off the front foot"
4.2,"Stokes to Sam Curran, 1 run","good length and just outside off, opens the face and runs it to short third's left off the back foot"
4.1,"Stokes to Sam Curran, SIX runs","pumped straight over his head! What a clean straight hit this is. Friendly full delivery just outside off, front leg out of the way and a clean swing through the line. Dead straight"
3.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Watson, OUT","taken at midwicket! Full and into leg stump with the angle. Watson gets the front leg forward, and flicks aerially, straight into that fielder's lap. It was there to picked off for runs and Watson can't believe it"
3.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Watson, FOUR runs","bounces over Samson off the inside edge. Good length and wide outside off, Watson wants to slash through the off side but gets an under-edge that clears the keeper"
3.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Watson, FOUR runs","swatted through midwicket. Short and just outside off, springs onto the front foot and pulls firmly into the turf and well to midwicket's left"
3.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Sam Curran, 1 run","short of a length and wide outside off, cut on the bounce to third man"
3.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","drilled through point. Overpitched and full and just outside off. Gets the front leg in the leg side and carves this behind square on the off side, off the front foot"
3.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Sam Curran, no run","full and just outside off, looks for the carve through point and chops it onto his boot"
2.6,"Archer to du Plessis, OUT","taken at short extra cover. Buttler lunging high to his left. Short and wide bouncer outside off. Faf wants to lift that over point with the pace, but is through the attempted guide a bit too soon. It comes off the inside part of the bat and floats to Buttler's left and he lands softly after jumping to his left"
2.5,"Archer to du Plessis, 2 runs","full slower ball on the pads, waits on it and flicks to midwicket's right"
2.4,"Archer to du Plessis, no run","short of a length and rising steeply just outside off, gets on top of the bounce and forces this to mid-off off the back foot"
2.3,"Archer to Sam Curran, 1 run","finds the edge but this is down to third man. Good length and climbing away from outside off, a defensive push this time"
2.2,"Archer to Sam Curran, no run","past the outside edge. Good length and moving away in the corridor, swishes inside the line as he looks for the back foot punch"
2.1,"Archer to Sam Curran, no run","good length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
1.6,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, no run","good length and into middle stump, defended down the pitch from the crease"
1.5,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, 2 runs",top edge clears the keeper and then Tyagi dives to his left after sprinting from third man. Short ball rising in the corridor and he was cramped on the attempted pull
1.4,"Rajpoot to Sam Curran, 1 run","misfield at mid-onby Uthappa. Short and just outside off, mistimed pull and it's snuck through from under Uthappa"
1.3,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, 1 run","short on the hips, allows it one and dabs into the square leg region"
1.2,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, FOUR runs","short and shaped away outside off, but he goes leg side anyway and drags this pull past midwicket off the inside half"
1.1,"Rajpoot to du Plessis, no run","good length and shaped away outside off, pushed to cover point off the back foot"
0.6,"Archer to Sam Curran, no run","beats the edge again. 146kph, short and climbing across the corridor as he defends inside the line"
0.5,"Archer to Sam Curran, no run","bouncer at 144kph, climbing up from a middle stump line and beaten the outside edge before sailing past his left shoulder"
0.4,"Archer to Sam Curran, no run",good length and at off stump. Nicely behind that to defend off the back foot
0.3,"Archer to du Plessis, 1 run",full and just outside off at 147kph. Pushed to mid-on's right off the inside half of the bat
0.2,"Archer to Sam Curran, 1 run",good length and shape away from middle stump. Defended into the off side with soft hands
0.1,"Archer to Sam Curran, no run",beats the outside edge. Good length and jagging away off the pitch as Curran looks to drive on the up
19.6,"Boult to Jordan, 1 run, OUT","yorker, swinging in, and there is a third umpire checking the striker's end. And we have a super over by the barest of margins. A second super over. Jordan's running is suspect here. he has turned around in a big circle, and is running two pitches off the main pitch. He has lost at least four yards doing that, and he has been beaten by an inch. Yorker, dug out, reaches the 30-yard circle towards long-on. Pollard comes in with the big throw to the keeper, but Jordan has brought on yet another Super Over"
19.5,"Boult to Hooda, 1 run","full and wide, and this might have been wide had he not got bat on it. Single to deep point"
19.4,"Boult to Hooda, no run","good umpiring. Hooda moves across the line, Bouls goes behind him with a yorker. Misses the yorker by a stump's width. Hooda wants a wide, but it is not called"
19.3,"Boult to Jordan, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, outside off, shovelled to long-on for one. Keeps it along the ground"
19.2,"Boult to Jordan, FOUR runs","oh finally some luck for KXIP. Pinpoint yorker, Jordan makes room, gets an inside edge past the keeper. Oh sweet relief, they must be thinking"
19.1,"Boult to Hooda, 1 run",
18.6,"Coulter-Nile to Jordan, no run",Jordan does look to take that route but this slower short ball squeezes under his attempted pull
18.5,"Coulter-Nile to Jordan, 2 runs","full and straight, pushed straight of long-on. Smart again. Soft hands too. Pollard has to run to his left and also in towards the ball. They take an easy two"
18.4,"Coulter-Nile to Jordan, FOUR runs",this is ordinary bowling really. Finally goes on-pace but well down the leg side with short fine leg up. This is poor execution in elite sport. Can't bowl half-volleys down leg with short fine leg in the circle. Tickled away for four
18.3,"Coulter-Nile to Hooda, 1 run","dropped at short fine leg. Oh this is not a good ball. Short of a length, slower, but down the leg side, and all Hooda has to do is clear short fine. But he doesn't get enough bat on this, and offers Chahar a sitter, head-high to his left. He spills it"
18.2,"Coulter-Nile to Hooda, FOUR runs","smart shot. Short of a length, on top of off, but Hooda makes room and plays the late-cut, bisecting short third man and backward point"
18.1,"Coulter-Nile to Hooda, 2 runs","slower ball, short of a length, outside off, he pulls this wide of long-on for two"
17.6,"Bumrah to Jordan, no run","slower ball, 123ks, full and wide, driven crisply, but straight to extra cover"
17.5,"Bumrah to Hooda, 1 run","low full toss again, he moves across to work this to deep midwicket for one"
17.4,"Bumrah to Jordan, 1 run","full and straight, a low full toss, pushed towards long-on for one"
17.3,"Bumrah to Rahul, OUT","bowled'im. Oh Bumrah. That piece of magic upsets all calculations and plans. What a piece of bloody magic. Yorker at 149ks to peg the off stumps back. And that is not all. It seems Rahul has the line covered, but it seems it shapes away late to beat his outside edge and then hit the wicket. Oh man, what a bowler Bumrah is"
17.2,"Bumrah to Rahul, 2 runs","full toss, quick, ow, hit straight to extra cover. Sharma feels the pinch. Takes the risk of a direct hit. Rahul is alert. He doesn't over-run. Comes back for the overthrow"
17.1,"Bumrah to Hooda, 1 run","Hooda swings hard, doesn't get all of it, will take a single to deep midwicket"
16.6,"Coulter-Nile to Hooda, 1 run","short of a length, slower ball, outside off, steered for one to short third man"
16.5,"Coulter-Nile to Hooda, no run","short of a length, outside off, beaten on the cut. Sharp pace here"
16.4,"Coulter-Nile to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, shovelled to deep square leg for one"
16.3,"Coulter-Nile to Rahul, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Coulter-Nile misses his yorker by six inches or a foot, and Rahul stays deep in the crease to go inside-out and in front of deep cover for four"
16.2,"Coulter-Nile to Rahul, 2 runs","short of a length, into the pitch, slower, pulled wide of long-on. Pollard puts a dive in, but can't deny them the second"
16.1,"Coulter-Nile to Rahul, 2 runs","on a length, angling in, pushed wide of long-on. Easy two"
15.6,"Bumrah to Hooda, SIX runs","you are looking for eight, you get 15. Bouncer at his badge, but unlike Pooran, Hooda manages to get inside the line of this. That bouncer was over the leg stumps, this is outside off. Hooda gets inside the line and pulls hard. The short boundary does the rest"
15.5,"Bumrah to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball, full and wide, driven to deep cover for one"
15.4,"Bumrah to Rahul, FOUR runs","short of a length, wide, with no deep point. That is a rare bad ball from Bumrah. Rahul cuts it perfectly into the gap. That is eight off this over"
15.3,"Bumrah to Rahul, no run","another slower ball, wide again, this time he catches up with it, but can't pierce the gap between point and short third man"

14.5,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","down the wicket, Pandya pulls the length back, he bunts this to leg for one"
14.4,"Krunal to Rahul, FOUR runs","doesn't miss out on this full toss. This is wide outside off, and he goes square of deep cover. All along the ground. Beats him"
14.3,"Krunal to Rahul, no run","oh misses out. Really missed out. A full toss down the leg side, all he needs is a tickle, but he tickes it too well, and sends it straight to short fine leg"
14.2,"Krunal to Rahul, no run","makes room, Pandya fires this in, punched straight to cover, who is in on the single"
14.1,"Krunal to Rahul, 2 runs","down the wicket, Pandya fires this in quick, Rahul places this wide of deep midwicket for two"

13.2,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","too full outside off, drilled to deep cover for one"
13.1,"Chahar to Rahul, SIX runs",Rahul takes on the loose ball. His fifth fifty comes up with a pull off a rank long hop. This is just a gift

12.5,"Bumrah to Pooran, OUT",Bumrah delivers again

11.6,"Chahar to Pooran, no run",Just the over MI needed. The last bundary-less over brought a wicket in the next over
11.5,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run",goes back to punch this length ball to long-on. Hurried into the shot because this is not short enough
11.4,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","slower loopy legbreak, just inside the wide line. Left alone"

11.1,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","ice legbreak outside off, turns away to beat him but not wide enough to be called"
10.6,"Pollard to Pooran, SIX runs","this is the Pooran show. Submit to it. After a four into the big side of the ground, he shuffles across to play the pick-up shot over the shorter leg boundary"
10.5,"Pollard to Pooran, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Singeing the turf as it travels to the extra-cover fence. A rare on-pace ball from Pollard, and he drives it on the up and square of deep cover"

10.1,"Pollard to Rahul, no run","nearly caught and bowled. Slower ball, Rahul early into the shot, but it reaches Pollard on the half-volley"
9.6,"Chahar to Pooran, FOUR runs","nicely done. After the six off the tossed-up delivery, he is back and waiting for the quicker one. Just turns out that this is turning down leg, and he guides it fine of fine leg"
9.5,"Chahar to Pooran, SIX runs","Pooran announces himself. Has he picked the wrong'un? At any rate, he has gone over long-off. And this is just a touch too full, and he goes over long-off. Powerful hit"

9.3,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","full and straight, doesn't turn, runs off the inside half of the bat for one"
9.2,"Chahar to Pooran, 1 run","quick legbreak first up, into the pads, worked to leg for one"
9.1,"Chahar to Gayle, OUT","Gayle looks to take on long-on off a spinner. Nearly goes over him, but this is a low-percentage shot. This is a slider, short and wide outside off, and instead of cutting it, he is looking to loft him over long-off. Not enough pace to work with. Caught at long-off"

7.3,"Chahar to Gayle, 2 runs","swept, uses his pace, places this square of short fine. Comes back for two"

6.6,"Pollard to Gayle, no run","slower ball again, but this is short, and it beats his pull"
6.5,"Pollard to Gayle, SIX runs","and this is why he was trying to stay out of Gayle's reach. he bowls straight, overpitches slightly, and Gayle lofts this over long-on. Not the cleanest of Gayle strikes, but this ground is not big enough"
6.5,"Pollard to Gayle, 1 wide","wide on the crease, full, angling in, drilled to the left of long-on, and Boult puts in the dive to save two runs. Oh sorry, they run just the one. So three runs saved"

6.3,"Pollard to Gayle, 1 run","length ball, angling in, driven hard, on the up, for a single to long-on"

6.1,"Pollard to Rahul, 1 run","full, straight and slow, clipped to deep midwicket for one"

19.5,"Jordan to Pollard, SIX runs","Jordan goes wide and full again, and this time Pollard nails his attempted hit over long-on. Such clean crisp hitting"
19.4,"Jordan to Pollard, 2 runs","wide full, might be a wide if he doesn't play it, but Pollard drags it to long-on. Takes the second, the throw has overtaken him as he turns around, but the ball is losing pace, and Pollard is gaining it. Easily makes the second"
19.3,"Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 1 run","nearly a yorker, outside off, Coulter-Nile does enough to bring Pollard back on strike"
19.2,"Jordan to Pollard, 1 run","he is going leg side every ball. Drags this length ball smack back at his batting partner. NCN ducks, saves himself, then runs the single"
19.1,"Jordan to Pollard, SIX runs","that is massive. Jordan bowls the bouncer outside off, hoping to make him cut to the big part of the field, but Pollard moves across to pull this clean out of the ground"
18.6,"Shami to Coulter-Nile, FOUR runs","short ball with short fine in the circle. The same mistake as Arshdeep. Trying not to be predictable, trying not to give way the ball with the field set, but it goes over short fine for four"
18.5,"Shami to Coulter-Nile, no run","yorker, dipping on him, 144ks, just outside off. So unlucky not to hit the off stump. It just moves away an inch after pitching"

17.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Coulter-Nile, FOUR runs","that is just rotten luck. A sharp bouncer, which hits the bat instead of bat making any move towards hitting it. In fact NCN is preserving his self and looking to sway away. The top edge, though, flies over short fine"
17.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Pollard, 1 run",gets the wide yorker right this time. Steered to third man for one
17.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Pollard, SIX runs","goes for the wide yorker, trying to make him hit to the bigger boundary on the off side, but Pollard shuffles across, takes this on the full and goes over wide mid-on, the shortest boundary in play. Another yorker missed. Young man must be intimidated"
17.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Pollard, SIX runs","and this is an intimidating start. Bowls full, on-pace, outside off. Has missed the yorker and bowled a half-volley. Pollard drills it over long-off for a six"
16.6,"Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs","strays down with a length ball, bunted into the big side of the ground, comes back for two, handing the strike over to POllard for the start of the next over"

14.4,"Ashwin to de Kock, no run","wrong'un, outside off, punched to cover"
14.3,"Ashwin to de Kock, SIX runs",lovely clean swing. Doesn't matter which way you are turning if you bowl a plum half-volley. He goes over long-on for a flat six
14.2,"Ashwin to de Kock, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Wrong'un, around off, and he manages to cut this up and over cover. Not enough room to be doing that, but he still manages to do so"
14.1,"Ashwin to de Kock, no run","full, on off, driven hard and back to Ashwin"
13.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pandya, SIX runs","this is why we love Pandya. It doesn't matter if it is the first ball. If it has to go, it has to go. Bishnoi bowls a little too full, and Pandya launches him over wide long-off. The head stays down and doesn't look at where the ball is going"
13.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Krunal, OUT","full, outside leg, Pandya tries the sweep, but this comes off the toe end for a smart catch for Hooda at deep square leg"
13.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to de Kock, 1 run","is this a legbreak?. De Kock is looking to make room and cut, but is cramped, and just survives thanks to his pad"

11.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Krunal, 1 run","looks for the reverse-hit, gives up his cards early, and Bishno pitches this well outside what would have been his leg stump. Just the single to what would have been his long-off"

18.6,"Shivam Mavi to Abdul Samad, OUT","a relay catch at deep midwicket! Oh this is a leg stump full toss and Samad doesn't get a clean swing out at it. The soft signal is out. He reached out a touch and just flicked this in the end. Lockie covered the ground to his left, caught it, and then put in a backhand flick to long-on. They're checking it upstairs. His right boot, on the balancing step, comes very very close to the boundary padding. He is confident about it. And this should remain out given there's no way to conclusively say the foot touched the padding. There's hardly a ripple there. And yes, it does stay out."

17.5,"Ferguson to Warner, 2 runs","high full toss, about thigh height. A slower ball at 119kph. Mistimed slog to deep midwicket's left"
17.4,"Ferguson to Abdul Samad, 1 run","dropped at backward point. Russell lunging to his left. Slower ball again it appears, short of a length outside off. Chops at it with an open face. It's wide to Russell's left and he can't grab on after putting in the dive. On his feet again"
17.3,"Ferguson to Abdul Samad, no run","beats the inside edge. A slower yorker this time, just dips inwards as he sets up outside off. Wants to drive through cover"
17.2,"Ferguson to Abdul Samad, 2 runs","yorker just outside off, half crouch as he feels for this and opens the wrists late. Only a chip to sweeper's right in the end"
17.1,"Ferguson to Abdul Samad, no run","beaten. A full slower ball wide outside off, steps the back leg deep into the crease and swings across the line, but that's gone from under him"
16.6,"Varun to Warner, 2 runs",short of a length and at leg stump. Goes deep in the crease and punches this to long-on's left with soft hands
16.5,"Varun to Abdul Samad, 1 run","short of a length and wide outside off, stand stall and spanks this on the rise. Straight to deep extra cover"
16.4,"Varun to Abdul Samad, FOUR runs","full outside off, steps out and meets the pitch of this before drilling it firmly to long-off's left. And it's too fast for Mavi"
16.3,"Varun to Abdul Samad, no run","good length and just outside off, punched on the rise to backward point"
16.2,"Varun to Warner, 1 run","good length and wide outside off, backs away and pummels this on the up but can't beat extra cover"
16.1,"Varun to Warner, 2 runs","good work at deep square. Tripathi. Full ball on the pads, whipped between deep square and deep midwicket. Tripathi falls into that ball and pushes with his right hand to get that out to deep midwicket"
15.6,"Cummins to Abdul Samad, no run",good length and in at off stump. Checks the push back at the bowler
15.5,"Cummins to Abdul Samad, SIX runs",smoked over square leg! Sweeet connection. What timing this is. Short and rising in the corridor. Hardly any feet movement but the weight is into the ball as he brings out quick hands and sends this off the middle of the bat with the pull
15.4,"Cummins to Abdul Samad, no run","good length and in at the stumps, pushed to midwicket's left"
15.3,"Cummins to Abdul Samad, 2 runs","short and up at middle stump, pulled off the front foot to deep square's left"
15.2,"Cummins to Shankar, OUT","taken at backward point! Short of a length outside off, Shankar wants to pull over midwicket off the front foot, but that's onto him too fast. Comes off the leading edge and Gill takes a few steps to his left and hangs on. A wicket after five matches for Cummins"
15.1,"Cummins to Shankar, no run","good length and in at off stump, defended into the off side"
14.6,"Kuldeep to Shankar, 1 run","good length and turning into leg stump, deep in the crease to clip to deep midwicket's right"
14.5,"Kuldeep to Warner, 1 run","full at leg stump, driven to long-on"
14.4,"Kuldeep to Warner, 2 runs",just clears short third. Full and dipping outside off. Tries the switch-ramp and gets a lot of elevation. Chakravarthy doesn't manage to get under that after running backwards and takes a tumble after stretching out for that
14.3,"Kuldeep to Shankar, 1 run","good length on leg stump, leans in and flicks to midwicket's right"
14.2,"Kuldeep to Shankar, 2 runs","full googly at leg stump. Allows that on and expertly clips through the backward square region, which is far enough from midwicket to pinch a second"
14.1,"Kuldeep to Warner, 1 run","Russell is hobbling after swooping dowhose old hamstring issues. Left leg. Good length and just outisde off, waits on that and pats it to long-on's right. Calls for the second and Russell is steaming in at this. Does well too and manages to grab it one-handed but immediately hobbles"
14.1,"Kuldeep to Warner, 1 wide","good length, flat and wide outside off. Left alone"
13.6,"Cummins to Warner, 1 run",short of a length and climbing across middle. Off the floor to try and pull behind square but cops that on the thigh
13.5,"Cummins to Warner, FOUR runs","chips it wide of mid-off. Full slower ball just outside off, nicely behind the line of that and a clean loft over his partner at the other end"
13.4,"Cummins to Shankar, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, pulled to deep square"
13.3,"Cummins to Shankar, no run","nearly played on. Good length and just outside off, was looking to nudge that pitch side and played it almost too softly in the end"
13.2,"Cummins to Warner, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to mid-off from the crease"
13.1,"Cummins to Warner, 4 leg byes","short and up at the hips at 145kph. Looks to swat that behind square, can't get bat, but it pings off the thigh and past DK"
12.6,"Kuldeep to Shankar, no run","full on middle stump, flicked to midwicket with the turn"
12.5,"Kuldeep to Warner, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
12.4,"Kuldeep to Warner, 2 runs","full outside off, driven with the turn to long-off's right"
12.3,"Kuldeep to Warner, no run",short and turning away. Very slow. Subdued cut to extra cover
12.2,"Kuldeep to Warner, no run","good length and turning away outside off, driven on the rise to extra cover"
12.1,"Kuldeep to Shankar, 1 run","loopy length ball outside off, jabbed into the covers with soft hands"
11.6,"Ferguson to Warner, no run","good length and just outside off, pushed into the off side off the toe-end"
11.5,"Ferguson to Warner, 2 runs","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
11.4,"Ferguson to Shankar, 1 run","good length outside off, hangs leg side of it and steers to third man from the crease"
11.3,"Ferguson to Pandey, OUT","148kph yorker and see ya! What a delivery. Wide of the crease, aimed for the base of off stump and through from under Pandey's attempted jab at that. He had the room and all but that was unplayable"
11.2,"Ferguson to Warner, 1 leg bye",leg stump yorker pins Warner on the shin but that pitched outside leg. Deflects to backward point
11.1,"Ferguson to Pandey, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to mid-off"
10.6,"Kuldeep to Pandey, 1 run","wrong'un lobbed right up at off stump, uppish drive to long-off"
10.5,"Kuldeep to Warner, 1 run","full on off stump, driven with the turn to long-off"
10.4,"Kuldeep to Warner, no run","full on middle stump, mistimed drive to Kuldeep's left"
10.3,"Kuldeep to Warner, 2 runs","tossed up at off stump, drives with the turn to long-off's right"
10.2,"Kuldeep to Pandey, 1 run","good length and turning in from outside off, gets forward and jabs this to extra cover's right"
10.1,"Kuldeep to Warner, 1 leg bye","a missed stumping opportunity. A difficult one because that seems to have hit Warner and changed path. Good length ball outside off, he runs down at it and is beaten in pace. It hits the flap of the front pad as he misses and that takes it past DK's left shoudler"
9.6,"Varun to Pandey, no run",good length and pushed through quicker outside off. Looks to scythe behind point and is beaten
9.5,"Varun to Warner, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to long-off"
9.4,"Varun to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length outside off, mistimed chop to sweeper cover"
9.3,"Varun to Pandey, 2 runs","good length and wide outside off, reaches out and steers this drive to sweeper's right"
9.2,"Varun to Bairstow, OUT",taken at straight long-off! Good length and lobbed up just outside off. He reaches out and looks to drill this on the rise. Russell is very straight at long-off and barely has to move
9.1,"Varun to Bairstow, no run","good length and just outside off, chopped to short third man"
8.6,"Ferguson to Warner, no run","short and going across middle stump, defended to midwicket off the back foot"
8.5,"Ferguson to Warner, no run","good length on middle stump, pushed to midwicket from the crease"
8.4,"Ferguson to Garg, OUT",tonks off stump with a slower ball! Lockie is dragging KKR back into this with every over. It's a legcutter release but the ball slides in from a good length. Garg was backing into the leg side after being tucked at his body. Wanted to open some room and chop behind square but that was both too full and at a completely changed pace. Superb from the bowler
8.3,"Ferguson to Garg, no run",good length and in at middle stump. Poked to midwicket with the angle
8.2,"Ferguson to Bairstow, 1 run","full and wide outside off, mistimed drive to mid-off"
8.1,"Ferguson to Garg, 1 run","good length and angled into middle stump, pushed to midwicket's right off the inside half"
7.6,"Varun to Bairstow, no run",short of a good length and spinning back in sharply to the corridor to cramp him on the cut. It rolls out into the off side
7.5,"Varun to Bairstow, FOUR runs","dropped short outside off, backs away to wait and chop this past backward point"
7.4,"Varun to Garg, 1 run","full outside off, nicely forward to drive to long-on"
7.3,"Varun to Bairstow, 1 run","good length and just outside off, mistimed pull out to long-on"

6.6,"Ferguson to Bairstow, 1 run","full and into middle stump, punched to long-on with the angle"
6.5,"Ferguson to Bairstow, no run","short and wide outside off, beaten on the cut"
6.4,"Ferguson to Bairstow, no run","full and just outside off, driven to mid-off off the toe-end"
6.3,"Ferguson to Garg, 1 run",good length and just outside off. Looks to get his weight into the front foot to drive through cover. Thick edge to third man's left
6.2,"Ferguson to Garg, no run","short and just outside off, cut to backward point"
6.1,"Ferguson to Williamson, OUT","taken at third man. Short and wide outside off. Looks for the upper cut and has managed to find the man perfectly in the deep. The shot was on, the placement not quite. He hobbles off having done a good job for them"
5.6,"Shivam Mavi to Bairstow, FOUR runs","nicely placed. Point and third man in the circle, he goes short of a length outside off. Bairstow walks down at that and chops it late to bisect the two fielders"
5.5,"Shivam Mavi to Williamson, 1 run","full and wide outside off, gets down on a knee to try and crunch this through the covers but he gets it off the toe-end. A slower ball too"
5.4,"Shivam Mavi to Williamson, no run","slower short ball wide outside off, mistimed cut to short third"
5.3,"Shivam Mavi to Williamson, no run","yorker length at middle stump, jammed to mid-on's left"
5.3,"Shivam Mavi to Williamson, 1 wide","short and wide outside off, left alone"
5.2,"Shivam Mavi to Williamson, SIX runs",steps into the off side and ramps this over short fine. Good length ball at 142kph outside off. Half a stride to get in line and watches that closely onto the middle of the bat
5.1,"Shivam Mavi to Williamson, no run","short and just outside off, angled into the body. Punched to cover's left off the back foot"
4.6,"Cummins to Bairstow, FOUR runs",oh poor bowling from Cummins. Bairstow has weathered the storm and survived Cummins' opening spells. The reward is a short ball down leg side and he uses the angle to pull to the long leg boundary
4.5,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run","short and wide outside off, looks to slap through the covers and is beaten"
4.4,"Cummins to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length on leg stump, flicked to deep square with the angle"
4.3,"Cummins to Williamson, no run","good length and down leg side, shuffles and can't manage to tickle this past short fine. That took the pad on the way to DK"
4.2,"Cummins to Williamson, FOUR runs","sweet! Full and onto middle stump. Stays still and tucks this wide of mid-on with the angle with no attempt to keep it down. All deliberate, all class"
4.1,"Cummins to Williamson, 2 runs","oh sweet timing again. Full and outside off, can't lean into this drive to mid-off's left but he does enough to get two"
3.6,"Russell to Bairstow, FOUR runs","slaughtered! Whew. No finesse from Bairstow. He gets the front leg well out of the way, lines up this short ball and sends it between deep square and deep midwicket with some force"
3.5,"Russell to Bairstow, FOUR runs","full and into the pads, stays upright and flicks this aerially and to short fine's left"
3.4,"Russell to Bairstow, no run","short of a length at middle stump, swipes it straight to short fine with the angle"
3.3,"Russell to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, pulled firmly to deep square"
3.2,"Russell to Williamson, no run","good length and just outside off, drops it into the off side with soft hands and doesn't even shape to take off for a run"
3.1,"Russell to Williamson, FOUR runs","good length outside off, leaps off the floor and awkwardly lands on one foot, but in the meantime he's also got the smoothest of back foot punches through the covers"
2.6,"Varun to Bairstow, no run","short of a length and ripping in outside off, beaten on the slash"
2.5,"Varun to Williamson, 1 run","full and outside off, reaches out and has a swish at this well in front of the body. Floats out to deep midwicket off the inside half"
2.4,"Varun to Bairstow, 1 run","good length at middle stump, steps out and flicks to deep square"
2.3,"Varun to Bairstow, FOUR runs","full outside off, gets down and fetches that with a vigorous sweep to the square leg boundary. Nailed it"
2.2,"Varun to Bairstow, FOUR runs","good length on middle stump, shuffles and whips it with the angle to short fine's left"
2.1,"Varun to Bairstow, no run",into the pads and pushed into the leg side with the angle
1.6,"Shivam Mavi to Williamson, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, waits on it and cuts it past backward point"
1.5,"Shivam Mavi to Williamson, FOUR runs","full and just outside off, backs into the leg side and drills this wide of mid-off. Sweet timing on it"

1.1,"Shivam Mavi to Williamson, no run","short and wide outside off, cut on the bounce to backward point"
0.6,"Cummins to Bairstow, 2 runs",good length and into him. Uses the angle to clip this to deep square's left
0.5,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run",lovely bouncer. Climbing up at the throat and he does well to keep his eyes on this and sway into the leg side to let that go
0.4,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run","good length and in at off stump, pushes it down the pitch from the crease. Tentative again"
0.3,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run",good length and slanted in at middle stump. Tentative nudge into the leg side
0.2,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run","good length and into the corridor, defended down the pitch"
0.1,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run","good length and wide outside off, looks to chop and is beaten"
19.6,"Basil to Morgan, OUT","taken at long-off. Good length ball outside off, hammed flat on the up and straight into Pandey's lap as he runs in from the boundary"
19.5,"Basil to Morgan, 2 runs","yorker at middle stump, squeezed down to long-on with the angle"
19.4,"Basil to Morgan, SIX runs","lofted with the angle over square leg. Three yorkers missed, and this is one better from Mogan's perspective, because it's angled right into his pads. Waits on it and swishes from under that"
19.3,"Basil to Morgan, 2 runs","overpitched on middle stump, mistimed slog off the inside half. Long-on runs to his left and parries it in with two hands as it bounces up to his left. Pushes it into deep midwicket's path"
19.2,"Basil to Morgan, FOUR runs","full outside off, makes room and drills this over the bowler. Pandey sprints to his left, gets low and flicks this past long-on who was converging. They run an extra run as a result, but his foot was also on the boundary padding as he  was letting the ball go. So that will be four probably. Looks like he had a fingertip on that as his knee made contact with the padding"
19.1,"Basil to Morgan, 2 runs","high full toss at middle stump, miscued slog to long-off's left. Off the high part of the inside half"
18.6,"Natarajan to Karthik, SIX runs","mistimed slog clears long-on. Full slower ball wide outside off. He was deep in the crease again to set up behind this outside off. Was into the swing a little early because of the pace, but he went through with it and it landed quite a way behind long-on"
18.5,"Natarajan to Morgan, 1 leg bye","full and into leg stump, looks to whip that behind square and misses out. Crashes into the pad and deflects into the off side. Natarajan missed the yorker on this, he gets away"
18.4,"Natarajan to Morgan, 2 runs","yorker at middle stump, forced to long-on's right off the toe-end"
18.3,"Natarajan to Karthik, 1 run","digs the slower ball in at a length, angled across off stump. Looks to lace it through the covers but that pings off the inside half and ends up long-on"
18.2,"Natarajan to Karthik, no run","good length, cutter, wide outside off. Steps into the off side for the sweep again but is beaten this time"
18.1,"Natarajan to Karthik, FOUR runs","full and wide outside off, gets the back leg into the off side to give himself extra swinging room and drills this past Morgan. Long-off is well beaten to his right"
17.6,"Sandeep to Karthik, 1 run","yorker outside off, jammed to extra cover's left"
17.5,"Sandeep to Karthik, SIX runs","walks into the off side and sweeps over square leg. Anticipated the full ball and was waiting, low and outside off. It was a full toss in the end and he just cleared the boundary there"
17.4,"Sandeep to Morgan, 1 run","wide yorker outside off, shuffles into line and is forced to jab this towards deep backward point"
17.3,"Sandeep to Karthik, 1 run","yorker length at middle stump, steps out and jams it down to long-on"
17.2,"Sandeep to Karthik, 2 runs","short of a length outside off, steps out and looks for the pull but is cramped. It ends up a harmless chip well in front of long-on and they pinch a second"
17.1,"Sandeep to Morgan, 1 run",walks into the off side and Sandeep follows him. Full and dipping away outside off. Lofted towards long-off
16.6,"Basil to Karthik, FOUR runs",too short and too wide. Might have also been a slower ball. Karthik waits on that on the back foot and hammers it past extra cover
16.5,"Basil to Morgan, 1 run","yorker at middle stump, driven to long-on"
16.4,"Basil to Morgan, FOUR runs","outside edge again but runs this time. Full and just outside off, clears the front leg and tries to use the angle to go midwicket this time"
16.3,"Basil to Morgan, no run","low full toss at off stump. Looks for the drive through cover, gets an outside edge that's brilliantly snapped by YJB to his left. On the bounce and was high to his left"
16.2,"Basil to Karthik, 1 run","full and into leg stump, pushed down to long-on with soft hands"
16.1,"Basil to Karthik, no run","short and wide outside off, mistimed cut to extra cover"
15.6,"Sandeep to Karthik, 1 run","good length outside off, opens the face and runs this to point's right"
15.5,"Sandeep to Morgan, 1 run","good length and just outside off, pushed to extra cover"
15.4,"Sandeep to Karthik, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
15.3,"Sandeep to Morgan, 1 run",full and into off stump. Very early into the drive and has to check it. Ends up well short of long-off
15.2,"Sandeep to Karthik, 1 run","good length and onto the pads, whipped to long leg off the back foot"
15.1,"Sandeep to Morgan, 1 run","short of a length outside off, chopped straight to backward point"
14.6,"Natarajan to Russell, OUT","he's found deep midwicket! Oh it was there to be clubbed. A length ball gripping and sitting up, just outside off. So much swinging room. But he swings it - and nails it - about stomach height and straight to the man in the deep"
14.5,"Natarajan to Morgan, 1 run","good length and just outside off, walks into that and pushes into the covers"
14.4,"Natarajan to Morgan, no run","short and just outside off, stabbed straight to short third man"
14.3,"Natarajan to Russell, 1 run","low full toss on leg stump, punched to deep midwicket"
14.2,"Natarajan to Morgan, 1 leg bye","slower ball, short of a length and raps him on the back thigh as he goes through with the pull shot. That pitched outside off and kept low"
14.1,"Natarajan to Morgan, FOUR runs","lofted to long-off's left. Full and just outside off, hangs leg side of it and nails the connection on this straight drive. On the bounce and into the boundary"
14.1,"Natarajan to Russell, (no ball) 1 run","low full toss at leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket and the siren goes off because he's overstepped"
13.6,"Rashid Khan to Morgan, no run","good length on leg stump, gets deep in the crease for the glance but cops that on the thigh"
13.5,"Rashid Khan to Morgan, no run","full at middle stump, pushed back to the bowler off the front foot"
13.4,"Rashid Khan to Russell, 1 run",another inside edge onto boot as he looks to bludgeon this over midwicket. Another googly. Full and just outside off
13.3,"Rashid Khan to Morgan, 1 run","good length and just outside off, watchfully pushed through point off the front foot"
13.2,"Rashid Khan to Russell, 1 run","googly lobbed up at middle stump, looks for the slog sweep, thick inside edge to deep backward square"
13.1,"Rashid Khan to Russell, no run","inside edge as he miscues the slog. It's a full and flat googly at off stump, gets it onto his pad"
12.6,"Shankar to Russell, 1 run","good length outside off, pushed into the covers with soft hands"
12.5,"Shankar to Russell, FOUR runs","drilled to the extra cover boundary. Overpitched and wide outside off, gets a nice forward stride and brings down the axe on this"
12.4,"Shankar to Russell, no run","good length and just outside off, walks into that and pats it to point"
12.3,"Shankar to Russell, no run","yorker floated out wide outside off, looks to chop it behind point and is beaten"
12.2,"Shankar to Russell, no run","good length and just outside off, defended off the back foot"
12.1,"Shankar to Rana, OUT","taken at midwicket. It's Garg again, and he had a long long way to run to take this. Good length ball just outside off, looked to slog that on the rise, got it off the inside part of the toe-end of the bat. Garg ran in from the boundary to his right and was still sprinting as he stretched out to his right  and took this near the circle"
11.6,"Rashid Khan to Rana, 1 run",good length and googly outside off. Gets deep in the crease and flicked to deep midwicket
11.5,"Rashid Khan to Rana, no run","fully googly on leg stump, cops it on the pad as he looks for the flick"
11.4,"Rashid Khan to Gill, OUT",taken at long-off. Garg sprinting and lunging to his left. Good length and pushed through at off stump. Looks to go inside-out and can't open the wrists well enough. It's flat and about waist height as Garg tracks it closely and takes it under his eyes
11.3,"Rashid Khan to Rana, 1 run","full outside off, swept to deep square"
11.2,"Rashid Khan to Rana, SIX runs","drilled over the bowler. Rashid overpitches again, this time at middle stump, and he's swung cleanly through that one as well"
11.1,"Rashid Khan to Rana, no run",beaten on the reverse sweep. Good length and going across the corridor
10.6,"Shankar to Rana, 1 run","diving stop at backward point. Short of a length outside off, makes room and cuts firmly but KW stretches out the left hand and stops that from finding the boundary"
10.5,"Shankar to Gill, 1 run","full outside off, driven along the ground to long-off"
10.4,"Shankar to Gill, no run","full toss outside off, driven straight back to the bowler"
10.3,"Shankar to Gill, no run","full and wide outside off, looks to reach out for the drive and loses balance. Bat turns and this is down the pitch off the inside half"
10.2,"Shankar to Gill, no run",short ball gets him in the body as he steps out and is through the pull shot early. That almost dipped into his body. Deflected to Bairstow's left
10.1,"Shankar to Rana, 1 run","good length and just outside off, mistimed drive through the covers off the front foot"
9.6,"Rashid Khan to Rana, 1 run","good length and sliding onto the pad as he gets down for the sweep. Big lbw appeal from Rashid, but that pitched outside leg"
9.5,"Rashid Khan to Rana, FOUR runs",swept to the square leg boundary. Gets low early and turns this full ball into a full toss on middle stump before the sweep
9.4,"Rashid Khan to Rana, FOUR runs",crunched over the bowler. This is overpitched outside off and he keeps the front leg away to allow a clean swing through the line
9.3,"Rashid Khan to Gill, 1 run","good length outside off, driven on the up to sweeper cover"
9.2,"Rashid Khan to Gill, 2 runs","good length outside off, sliced on the rise to sweeper's left"

8.5,"Shankar to Gill, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven along the ground to long-off"
8.4,"Shankar to Rana, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, cuts off the under-edge as this keeps coming into him with the angle"
8.3,"Shankar to Rana, FOUR runs","nicely placed. Walks out at the good length ball outside off, and goes inside-out to loft this over extra cover"
8.2,"Shankar to Rana, no run","good length and just outside off, defended to point off the front foot"
8.1,"Shankar to Rana, no run",short and at an off stump line. Walks down but is forced to duck
7.6,"Rashid Khan to Rana, 1 run","full on middle stump, gets low and checks his sweep, along the floor to long leg's right"
7.5,"Rashid Khan to Rana, 2 runs",thick edge retrieved by the back pedaling short third man. Pushed out at this as it went across him from a length
7.4,"Rashid Khan to Rana, no run","good length on middle stump, defended on the front foot"
7.3,"Rashid Khan to Gill, 1 run","googly, good length and into leg stump. Whipped to midwicket's right off the back foot"

6.6,"Shankar to Gill, 1 run","good length at middle stump, punched to long-on's right"
6.5,"Shankar to Gill, FOUR runs","thick outside edge squeezes through from under Sandeep at short third man. Good length outside off, looks to drive on the rise and this edge loops on Sandeep who is stuck halfway between diving forward for the catch and going sideways to get his body behind to save the runs. By the end, he's not even down in time"
6.4,"Shankar to Gill, no run","good length and into the pads, flicked to short fine leg"
6.3,"Shankar to Gill, no run","good length and just outside off, gets forward and stabs it down the pitch"
6.2,"Shankar to Gill, no run",beaten on the pull. Short ball sticks in the pitch and loops through to the keeper as Gill pulls over it outside off
6.1,"Shankar to Gill, no run","short of a length and just outside off, rises on top of the bounce and guides it straight to backward point"
5.6,"Natarajan to Tripathi, OUT",swipes across the line and loses his stumps. Good length ball headed for the top of off stump. He isn't behind the line as he wants the room to slog into the leg side. A bit slow on it in the end and that knocks off stump
5.5,"Natarajan to Gill, 1 run","good length and just outside off, pushed to point's right with soft hands"
5.4,"Natarajan to Gill, FOUR runs","short at the hips, and an elegant short-arm pick-up to deep square's left. Stays very still and waits for this to get right under his head as he pulls off the front foot"
5.3,"Natarajan to Tripathi, 1 run","short and climbing away from middle stump. Looks for the flick, gets a leading edge that off the thumb and handle to short third man"
5.2,"Natarajan to Tripathi, no run","good length at middle stump, hurriedly defended down the pitch"
5.1,"Natarajan to Tripathi, no run",beaten as he swishes inside the line of this good length ball. That was going across him with the angle outside off
4.6,"Basil to Gill, no run","slower short ball outside off, backs into the leg side and has a lot of swinging room for this cut. But he finds Pandey at cover point and rues the missed opportunity"
4.5,"Basil to Tripathi, 1 run","full slower ball on leg stump, flicked to midwicket's right"
4.4,"Basil to Gill, 1 run",good length and a slower ball outside off. Mistimed pull to mid-on's right
4.3,"Basil to Gill, FOUR runs",pierces the covers. Expertly done. Short and climbing up at his body. He backs a long way into the leg side and punches this between cover and point off the back foot
4.2,"Basil to Gill, FOUR runs","gets the pull away this time. A bit off the low part of the bat, but nicely in position this time for the front foot pull over midwicket"
4.1,"Basil to Gill, FOUR runs","deflected to third man as he looks for the pull off the front foot. Short of a length just outside off, late on that and it's off the leading edge and fine"
3.6,"Natarajan to Tripathi, FOUR runs",short and up at the hips. Allows it on and swivels to drag this to vacant long leg with a short-arm pull
3.5,"Natarajan to Gill, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to mid-off's right"
3.4,"Natarajan to Gill, no run","good length at a leg stump line, backs into the leg side and punches to mid-on's left"
3.3,"Natarajan to Tripathi, 1 run","short and just outside off, dropped into the off side with soft hands"
3.2,"Natarajan to Tripathi, SIX runs",chipped over the bowler. Full and at off stump. Solid base as he offers the full face and lofts this
3.1,"Natarajan to Gill, 1 run","good length on middle stump, punched against the angle to mid-on's right"
2.6,"Sandeep to Gill, 1 run","good length and in at leg stump, clipped to midwicket's left"
2.5,"Sandeep to Tripathi, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked aerially through square leg"
2.4,"Sandeep to Tripathi, no run","good length on leg stump, nudged to midwicket off the back foot"
2.3,"Sandeep to Gill, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, flicked to deep square with the angle"
2.2,"Sandeep to Gill, no run","good length and slanted in at middle stump, backs into the leg side but can't get the drive past extra cover"
2.1,"Sandeep to Gill, no run","full and wide outside off, driven straight to extra cover"
1.6,"Basil to Tripathi, 2 runs","good length and into leg stump, flicked to deep square's right"
1.5,"Basil to Gill, 1 run","good length just outside off, punched past the bowler's outstretched right hand. Mid-off's through to the striker's end nearly takes out the bowler who is still on the floor"
1.4,"Basil to Tripathi, 1 run","good length outside off, chopped to third man off the back foot"
1.3,"Basil to Gill, 1 run","Rashid drops it at deep square. A simple catch. Or so it seemed until he looked rushed. Full and into the pads, flicked aerially and flat. It's waist height, but Rashid slides on his knees and goes reverse cup, under this. Looks like he misjudged that or reacted late. Bursts through his hands"
1.2,"Basil to Gill, no run","good length and just outside off, punched on the rise to short extra cover"
1.1,"Basil to Tripathi, 1 run","good length and just outside off, opens the face and runs this to third man"
0.6,"Sandeep to Gill, no run","good length and just outside off, steps out and punches to mid-off"
0.5,"Sandeep to Tripathi, 1 run","good length and into the pads, clipped through square leg off the back foot"
0.4,"Sandeep to Tripathi, no run","good length at middle, flicked to midwicket"
0.3,"Sandeep to Tripathi, FOUR runs","nicely placed. Strange position for point though. They're usually very square at this level, but this point fielder is more in cover's direction. Full ball outside off, leans in and opens the face to guide this to third man's right"
0.2,"Sandeep to Gill, 1 run","full inswinger onto the pads, flicked to midwicket's right and only a half stop there after a dive"
0.1,"Sandeep to Gill, no run","inswinger at a length from outside off, walks into that and punches to mid-on"
19.5,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, SIX runs","Jadeja tries to bowl like Kadhav but it doesn't matter. It is right in Patel's slot, and he lofts it well over long-on for a clean six. What a cameo from Axar. Stepping out of Jadeja's shadows. At least in the IPL"
19.4,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, 2 runs","placed into a hole on the leg side, and they come back for the second. Scores level"
19.3,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, SIX runs","Patel shows he is not a one-trick pony. Jadeja goes wide outside off, and he shows the more classical inside-out lofted drive for six. Cooler as"
19.2,"Jadeja to Axar Patel, SIX runs","Patel takes Jadeja on. They are similar players. You could even argue Patel would have had a longer India career if not for Jadeja in the limited-overs formats. This is flat, just short of a length, and he has used his long limbs to slog it over deep midwicket. Cool as"
19.1,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run","oh this is in the slogging zone, Dhawan tries the sweep, but gets a bottom edge for a single to deep square leg"
19.1,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 wide",stays wide of his reach but bowls too wide. Not happy with the call
18.6,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, 1 run",nearly holes out. Hit hard to long-off on the first bounce. The dugout stands up to applaud a maiden T20 century for Dhawan but he is not celebrating. He knows he has a job to do in the last over
18.5,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, no run","Dhoni is the only one appealing, and he is given. Dhawan reviews immediately. Dhawan again shuffles across to pick the square-leg gap, but Curran bowls full and wide, and squeezes it under his bat. Bat hits the ground, the ball is nowhere near the bat, no appeal from the bowler, but another umpire finds it hard to deny a Dhoni appeal. Well done, DRS"
18.4,"Sam Curran to Axar Patel, 1 run","pinpoint wide yorker, squeezed out for a single"
18.3,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, 1 run","full and wide, driven hard, to the fielder in the deep. Curran bowling to his field"
18.3,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, 1 wide","short of a length, looks to stay out of Dhawan's hitting zone, but goes too wide. Called for it"
18.2,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, no run","yorker outside off, Dhawan caught on leg stump, gets a bottom edge. Nearly played on"
18.1,"Sam Curran to Carey, OUT","low full toss, into the body, less room to swing his arms through it, and he holes out to wide long-on. If Pant gets fit, this might be the last we see of Carey this IPL"
17.6,"Thakur to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","he manufactures a four. Shuffles across, down on a knee, sweeps him like a spinner. Over square leg. How well has he picked his spots tonight?"
17.5,"Thakur to Carey, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, seems like a slower ball, punched down to long-off for one"
17.4,"Thakur to S Dhawan, 1 run","wide full toss, and Dhawan has missed out. Driven straight to deep cover"
17.3,"Thakur to S Dhawan, 2 runs","low full toss outside off, hit off the toe end, straight of long-on. Jadhav puts in a dive to keep them down to two"
17.2,"Thakur to Carey, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, Carey early into the shot, ends up dragging this towards deep midwicket but it doesn't reach there on the full"
17.1,"Thakur to Carey, no run","Carey backs away early, Thakur follows him, hits him on the pad. They want Carey on strike all the time"
16.6,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, no run","yorker, just outside off, dug out back to him. Good comeback but DC have got what they wanted from this over"
16.5,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, no run",cramps him up with a high full toss. Dhawan looks at the leg umpire but he is told this isn't too high
16.4,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, SIX runs",Curran goes one better and serves up a leg-side half-volley. Dhawan plays a sensational short-arm drive. No follow-through. Just the punch. Over long-on he goes
16.3,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","length ball, 137ks, into the pads. Not what you bowl to someone on 81 off 46. Hit wide of long-on for four. Make it 85 off 47 now"
16.2,"Sam Curran to Carey, 1 run","full, nearly a yorker, dug out to leg for one"
16.1,"Sam Curran to Carey, no run","Carey, under pressure, looks for the ramp, is beaten by a length ball"
15.6,"Thakur to Carey, 1 run","short of a length, pushed to the left of Jadeja at point. A little yes-no creates a run-out chance but the consequent overthrow gets them a single"
15.5,"Thakur to S Dhawan, 1 run",driven down to long-off for one
15.4,"Thakur to Stoinis, OUT",Thakur keeps coming at Stoinis. Goes even shorter this time. Stoinis is shuffling across to look to work this square on the leg side. Gets a massive top edge for a catch at midwicket
15.3,"Thakur to Stoinis, SIX runs","not the cleanest of his sixes, but this will do. Short of a length, Stoinis pulls this off the front foot, sends this really high, but it has just enough muscle behind it to carry over long-on"
15.2,"Thakur to S Dhawan, 1 run","dropped again. Fourth life for Dhawan. Rayudu goes straight to the towel. Is this dew at work? Full ball, on off, hit hard towards extra cover, and it just hits his hand and spills out"
15.1,"Thakur to Stoinis, 1 run","on a length, just outside off, 135ks, pushed wide of cover for one"
14.6,"Karn to S Dhawan, 2 runs","down the wicket, Sharma fires this it into the pads seam-up at 105ks, he clips this square of short fine leg, but Curran makes a diving save at the boundary to keep them to two"
14.5,"Karn to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","backs away, takes this on the half-volley, and drills it between deep midwicket and long-on. Dismissive batting"
14.4,"Karn to Stoinis, 1 run","short of a length, wide, Stoinis will feel he has missed out as he has found the fielder at point"
14.3,"Karn to S Dhawan, 1 run","tries the big sweep, the full ball skids through to take the bottom edge to short fine leg"
14.2,"Karn to S Dhawan, 2 runs","full, clipped off the toes, Jadeja misfields at deep midwicket to allow them the second"
14.1,"Karn to Stoinis, 1 run","short of a length, pretty straight, punched down to long-on for one"
13.6,"Bravo to S Dhawan, 2 runs","Dhawan shuffles across to pick on the leg side, Bravo drags his line wide, and he changes his shot to go over cover. Not a clean hit, but just enough to clear the extra cover"
13.5,"Bravo to S Dhawan, no run","wide yorker, on-pace, 132ks, beats him even as he steps out of the crease. Late on this one"
13.4,"Bravo to Stoinis, 1 run","loopy slower ball again, driven square on the off side"
13.3,"Bravo to S Dhawan, 1 run","full, on-pace, just outside off, driven to long-off for one"
13.2,"Bravo to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","well Dhawan reminds me of the spinner jibes Bravo keeps getting. He moves across early, picks the slower ball, and sweeps him like an offspinner. Over square leg"
13.1,"Bravo to Stoinis, 1 run","length ball, angling in, 133ks, hit to deep midwicket for one"
12.6,"Karn to Stoinis, 1 run","quicker, short of a length, dabs on it for a single"
12.5,"Karn to Stoinis, FOUR runs","no beating in the flight here. Half-volley, around off, and he unfurls his wrists to get power into this cover drive over extra cover. Superb batting"
12.4,"Karn to Stoinis, SIX runs","Stoinis keeps doing what DC keep doing. This is T20. This is Sharjah. Don't worry too much. Keep hitting. He was beaten three balls ago, but he lofts this over long-off. Beaten in the flight, but still goes through with the shot"
12.3,"Karn to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, into the pads, and this is good bowling to his field. Just the single to deep square leg"
12.2,"Karn to Stoinis, 1 run","short of a length, hit hard down the ground to long-on"
12.1,"Karn to Stoinis, no run","slow, dipping legbreak, Stoinis looks for a hit over long-off, and is beaten comprehensively"
11.6,"Bravo to Stoinis, 1 run","full and straight, driven to long-on for one"
11.5,"Bravo to Stoinis, no run","on a length, straight, punched to straight short midwicket"
11.4,"Bravo to S Dhawan, 1 run","slower ball, full outside off, drilled hard to long-off"
11.3,"Bravo to Iyer, OUT","Iyer looks to take Barvo down as he bowls length and gives him pace to work with. Iyer backs himself to hit sixes down the ground, but the slowness of the pitch means he is early into it and the bat face closes a touch. Caught at long-on"
11.2,"Bravo to Iyer, 2 runs","short of a length, outside off, punched in front of sweeper cover, and this time they take Thakur on and come back for an easy two"
11.1,"Bravo to Iyer, FOUR runs","slips down with an on-pace delivery, and Iyer gets more than a tickle on this. Fine leg stands no chance"
10.6,"Sam Curran to Iyer, 1 run","slower offcutter, no room, Iyer opens the face, gets a single"
10.5,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, 1 run","superb yorker, swinging in, dipping, Dhawan just about gets some bat on it, and Iyer calls him through for one even though the ball hasn't gone far"
10.4,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","Dhawan is in some form. Dances down the wicket, turns this length ball into a half-volley, and drives it inside-out, all along the ground, past extra cover"
10.3,"Sam Curran to Iyer, 1 run","full and wide, driven to deep cover for one"
10.2,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, 1 run","length ball, angling in, pushed into the leg side for one"
10.1,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","a nothing loosener. Short of a length, no sting, no bite, no pace. He smashes him down the ground, and while both long-off and long-on are back, they have been bisected"
9.6,"Bravo to S Dhawan, 1 run","dropped by Dhoni or has it not carried?. Full and wide by Bravo. Front-of-the-hand slower ball, Dhawan looks to drive, his bat hits the ground, but the ball hits the edge, and it carries low to Dhoni's left, who is just late on it. The glove just comes down late. No other way of saying it"
9.5,"Bravo to Iyer, 1 run","on-pace, on a length, angling in, uppishly hit to deep square"
9.4,"Bravo to Iyer, no run","slower ball, on a length, around off, pushed to short straight midwicket"
9.3,"Bravo to S Dhawan, 1 run","full, outside off, driven down to long-off for one. Another fifty for Dhawan"
9.2,"Bravo to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, straight, punched down to long-on for one"
9.1,"Bravo to S Dhawan, 1 run","full and wide, driven to deep cover for one"
9.1,"Bravo to S Dhawan, 1 wide","starts off with a big wide outside off, though"
8.6,"Karn to Iyer, no run","tries the big hit down the ground, but Sharma has bowled this slow and smart, getting both drift and dip. Beats him, hits him on the pad in front, but this pitched outside leg. Iyer lucky to get away with this. Had he got bat on this, there was a good chance of holing out"
8.5,"Karn to Iyer, no run","full and straight, defended to the straight short midwicket"
8.4,"Karn to S Dhawan, 1 run","on a length, middle and leg, worked behind square on the leg side"
8.3,"Karn to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","lovely shot, picks the wrong'un, goes back, makes room, cuts this from in front of off, and picks the gap at deep cover"
8.2,"Karn to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","rocket down the ground. Long-off doesn't have far to to go to his left, but he stands no chance. Dhawan skips down the wicket, gets to the pitch of it, and just drills it over his head"
8.1,"Karn to Iyer, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, stays back to sort of pull this to long leg for one"
7.6,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, off-pace again, pushed wide of extra cover for another single. Just the singles off this over"
7.5,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, Dhawan is down the wicket to punch this to extra cover"

7.1,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, straight, tucked away off the hip"
6.6,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run",just a boring old single down the ground to end the over
6.5,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","short of a length, he goes back, and nails this pull for a flat four just in front of deep square leg"
6.4,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","it is almost like Dhawan is teasing them and testing the creaky joints on the field. This time he tosses up a catch to Watson's right at short third. And it is like everything is happening at normal pace, but Watson dives in slow motion. Another life"
6.3,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 2 runs","dropped at deep square. Chahar has ages to settle under this, but he has misjudged it and has to put in a big dive in the end. Dhawan gets down for a sweep, but the extra bounce takes his too edge. Chahar does the rest"
6.2,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run","full, into the pads, driven to long-on"
6.1,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run","length ball, middle and leg, worked to leg for one"
5.6,"Thakur to S Dhawan, 1 run","slower-ball, full toss outside off, pushed wide of cover for one"
5.5,"Thakur to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","cracking shot. Not sure this is where he exactly intended to go when he skipped down the wicket, but the length ball is wide, and he drives it square through point"
5.4,"Thakur to Iyer, 1 run","slower short ball, Iyer is off his toes to fend it into the covers for one"
5.3,"Thakur to Iyer, no run","full, outside off, driven hard, but straight to cover"
5.2,"Thakur to Iyer, SIX runs","lovely shot. On a length, on off, and Iyer shows DC batsmen keep coming at you. Keeps his head down, and swings through its line to clear long-on"
5.1,"Thakur to Iyer, no run","short of a length, straight, defended back to him"
4.6,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 leg bye","seam movement as Iyer plays for the outswinger. Hit high on the pad, right in front, but not given out because of the height. Dhoni agrees"
4.5,"Chahar to Iyer, no run","length ball, angling in, pushed to leg"
4.4,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","direct hit at Dhawan's end this time. Short of a length, no room, dabbed towards point, and they rush through for one. Jadeja gets the throw right, but Dhawan is well in"
4.3,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run","nearly played on, nearly run out. And now he has hurt himself. He looks down for the count. Short of a length, outside off, he looks to punch it, drags it on, and his foot comes in the way. The ball rolls to slip, Dhawan runs, Iyer responds but he can't get any power into the run because he has hurt himself. Watson misses with the direct hit"
4.2,"Chahar to Iyer, no run","full, at off, defended back towards him"
4.1,"Chahar to Rahane, OUT","Chahar has one more. Rahane's horror IPL continues. He shows the right intent, makes room, hits hard, but straight to Curran at point. Smart catch because it is hit hard, but it has come straight at him"
3.6,"Thakur to Rahane, 1 run","on a length, outswinger, pushed wide of extra cover for a single"
3.5,"Thakur to S Dhawan, 1 run","cuts this in the air, one the bounce to deep point"
3.4,"Thakur to Rahane, 1 run","on a length, outside off, slight shape away, driven to deep cover. Wide throw from Bravo but Jadhav at midwicket is late to go and back it up. He does so belatedly and just in time"
3.3,"Thakur to Rahane, FOUR runs","Mumbaikar to Mumbaikar. Rahane seems like he knows Thakur inside out. Waits for a short ball first ball, and pulls him over wide mid-on"
3.2,"Thakur to S Dhawan, 1 run","shuffles across, gets too close to this shortish ball outside off. Punches it square, past point, for one"
3.1,"Thakur to S Dhawan, no run","starts off with a gentle shoritsh ball, and he is lucky it stays low to beat his pull"
2.6,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","slower short ball, wide outside off, and he pulls it to deep square for one"
2.5,"Chahar to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","smart batting. Short of a length, outside off, sits in the surface, but Dhawan does enough with his upper-cut to clear short third man"
2.4,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 2 runs","short of a length, whipped wide of long leg, Rahane goes for the second, but a more accurate throw would have got him. Curran's throw is wide, allowing Rahane to get in"
2.3,"Chahar to Rahane, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, placed in front of backward point for one"
2.2,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","on a length, on top off, pushed wide of cover-point for one"

1.6,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, no run","on a length, no room, pushed to the left of Curran, who keeps them in their crease"
1.5,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Dhawan has found his form of late. Down the wicket, not quite to the pitch of the ball, but holds his shape and extends his arms through it to chip it back over his head"
1.4,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, no run","full, swinging away, times it nicely, but straight to cover"
1.3,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","short, no bite in it, Dhawan sits back pull it through square leg"
1.2,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, no run","on a length, angling in, defended back to Curran"
1.1,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, no run","and there is some swing for him, away from Dhawan, who lets it go through to the keeper"
0.6,"Chahar to Rahane, no run","inswinger, draws an inside edge onto the pad. The second maiden in Sharjah this year. This one has a big cherry at the top in the form of Shaw's wicket"
0.5,"Chahar to Rahane, no run",another lovely outswinger. Rahane defends this to cover
0.4,"Chahar to Rahane, no run","outswinger now, slightly full, around off, defended back to him"
0.3,"Chahar to Rahane, no run","wide on the crease, inswinger this time, headed towards top of off. Defended off the front foot"
0.2,"Chahar to Shaw, OUT","Chahar has got him five times out of six. That is an ordinary shot. Outswinger just outside off, and he is looking to flick this to leg. The leading edge settles with Chahar. A second straight duck for Shaw"
0.1,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","length-ball outswinger, outside off, punched to cover"
19.6,"Nortje to Jadeja, 1 run","full and wide, drilled to deep cover, and this does my head in no end. Why wouldn't you keep running till you are run out off the last ball? Put that fielder under pressure at least"
19.5,"Nortje to Jadeja, 2 runs","sharp bouncer, top edge, but falls well short of deep midwicket, and they come back for an easy two"
19.4,"Nortje to Jadeja, SIX runs","and now he shows what happens when Jadeja connects them. On a length, in the slot, on the pads, Jadeja times this perfectly over long-on"
19.3,"Nortje to Jadeja, SIX runs","misses the yorker, Jadeja gets a low full toss at 142ks. He has not absolutely nailed this, but so small is this ground that even the toe end clears long-on"
19.2,"Nortje to Jadeja, no run","yorker outside off, well inside the wide line, and no amount of hard stares at the umpire will get you a wide call here"
19.1,"Nortje to Rayudu, 1 run","slower ball, 122ks, dipping low full toss, slogged out to deep midwicket"
18.6,"Rabada to Jadeja, SIX runs","high full toss, angling in, just below the waist, but well above the fence. Jadeja goes deep into the crease, and deposits it over wide long-on"
18.5,"Rabada to Rayudu, 1 run",yorker as Rayudu dances down again. Gets the inside edge onto the pad. The ball is on the pitch but they take the single despite a direct kick from Rabada
18.4,"Rabada to Rayudu, no run","bouncer, sharp one, 148ks. The quicker bounce a la Andy Roberts. Beats him neck and crop on the hook"
18.3,"Rabada to Rayudu, SIX runs","nonchalant. This is a short ball outside off at 144ks. Rayudu aborts his early designs of trying to ramp this, and plays the pull over deep square"
18.2,"Rabada to Jadeja, 1 run","full and straight, can't get under it. Single to long-on"
18.1,"Rabada to Rayudu, 1 run","down the wicket, Rabada yorks him again. Off the inside edge onto the pad, and a single to cover"
18.1,"Rabada to Rayudu, 1 wide","harsh call. Rayudu has shuffled across, Rabada bowls a yorker that starts in front of the stumps and swings down leg. Just misses the leg stump"
17.6,"Deshpande to Jadeja, 2 runs","full and straight, and he misses the run-out of Rayudu. Rayudu charges back for the second, but Rahane's throw from long-off is slightly slow. Deshpande can't gather it"
17.6,"Deshpande to Jadeja, 1 wide",slower ball gone wrong. Too wide outside off
17.5,"Deshpande to Jadeja, SIX runs","Jadeja looks to make room, Deshpande looks to follow him, and he strays too far down leg. Jadeja is clever, stands his ground, and plays the pick-up over square leg into the street where a young man makes away with the ball"
17.4,"Deshpande to Rayudu, 1 run","yorker, just outside off, dug out to point for one"
17.3,"Deshpande to Jadeja, 1 run",makes room to punch this short-of-a-length ball to long-off for one

17.1,"Deshpande to Jadeja, 1 run","short of a length, tucked away off the hip for a single to deep square leg"

16.4,"Nortje to Jadeja, no run","short of a length, no room, fended off the back foot"
16.3,"Nortje to Dhoni, OUT","Dhoni takes Nortje on, and edges through. Seems like a slower ball, at 134ks (believe that), and Dhoni is early into the swing. He has skipped down the wicket, gets a meaty edge, and it just about carries through to the keeper"
16.2,"Nortje to Rayudu, 1 run","yorker gone wrong, low full toss, into the toes, played to deep midwicket for one"
16.1,"Nortje to Rayudu, SIX runs","lovely lovely shot. The best of Rayudu. Wide length ball, slower one at 128ks, and he stays beside the line and goes inside-out over cover. Sweet connection"
15.6,"Stoinis to Rayudu, 1 run","full toss, about knee-high, swinging away a touch, Rayudu gets a soft outside edge to short third man for one"
15.5,"Stoinis to Rayudu, SIX runs","that is out of the crews. Jumps at Stoinis again, turns this into a length ball, and goes over long-on with a clean swing of the bat"
15.4,"Stoinis to Dhoni, 1 run","full, just outside off, 141ks, hit hard but straight to mid-off"
15.3,"Stoinis to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length, 131s, Rayudu jumps at him and is early into the shot. Gets a bottom edge for a single"

15.1,"Stoinis to Dhoni, no run","quick length ball, 138ks, just outside off. Dhoni caught in no man's land with no feet movement. Throws his hands at the ball, and is beaten"
14.6,"Rabada to Dhoni, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, runs this down to third man"
14.5,"Rabada to Rayudu, 1 run","can't get much off the free hit, as he is hit on the inside half of the bat on the slog"
14.5,"Rabada to Rayudu, (no ball)","why is this a no-ball? This is a perfect bouncer, in front of his face, and Rayudu looks at square leg. This is called no-ball. Has to be a line call. Or was this the second bouncer of the over?"
14.4,"Rabada to du Plessis, OUT","Dhawan dropped the easy one, but takes the difficult one. Du Plessis charges at him, Rabada follows him, it goes off the inside half of the bottom of the bat, and Dhawan dives forward at long-on to take the catch. He then does the thigh five, and also jumps on Rabada, who is now the fastest to 50 IPL wickets"
14.3,"Rabada to du Plessis, no run",slower bouncer - it reads 140ks on the gun. Perhaps it just sits in the surface and comes off slowly. Beats his attempt to ramp it. Beats him with the slowness of the pace
14.2,"Rabada to du Plessis, no run","short of a length now, 142ks, and it goes under the bat as du Plessis slogs. Over the wicket it goes"
14.1,"Rabada to du Plessis, FOUR runs","du Plessis slogs at a length ball first ball, and gets a healthy inside edge to the left of Carey for four"
13.6,"Ashwin to Rayudu, 2 runs","reverse-sweeps another carrom ball, from in front of the stumps, can't get it as square as he wants it to go, but just about clears cover-point"

13.4,"Ashwin to Rayudu, no run","wide on the crease, wide carrom ball, and Rayudu is beaten on the cut. Carey doesn't collect it. Has he dropped him? Not sure if there is an edge"
13.3,"Ashwin to Rayudu, SIX runs",big sweep. Not much turn on this length-ball carrom ball and he sweeps this just over deep square for six
13.2,"Ashwin to Rayudu, no run","carrom ball again, and he beats him in the flight too. Gets time to turn. Pushed towards cover-point"
13.1,"Ashwin to du Plessis, 1 run","another carrom ball, starts outside leg, turns towards the stumps, worked into the leg side"
12.6,"Axar Patel to Rayudu, 2 runs",chipped over extra cover as Patel goes wide. Gets a couple for this
12.5,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","on a length, around off, pushed towards long-off this time"
12.4,"Axar Patel to Rayudu, 1 run",they are peppering Dhawan here. Another pull straight to Dhawan but along the ground now
12.3,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","Dhawan has dropped du Plessis. The third ball hit to him this over. Du Plessis down the wicket, not to its pitch, hits it in front of long-on, but Dhawan spills it as his knees hit the ground"
12.2,"Axar Patel to Rayudu, 1 run","down the wicket, hits this powerfully, straight of long-on, but Dhawan makes a diving save to his left"
12.1,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","short of a length, hurries him into the pull, but it lands short of long-on. Hits him high on the bat"
11.6,"Nortje to Rayudu, no run","down the wicket, Nortje spears in a full and fast delivery at 146ks to cramp him up. He gets an inside edge into the pads"
11.5,"Nortje to Rayudu, no run","on a length, around off, 148ks, defended to cover"
11.4,"Nortje to Watson, OUT","top of middle with a 139ks length ball. On-pace, on-seam. Watson is looking to give himself room and swing, but does so down the wrong line"
11.3,"Nortje to du Plessis, 1 run","yorker, swinging in late, appeal for lbw, but he seems to have got an inside edge on the pad. Du Plessis is celebrating his fifty, but Iyer has called for a review. At any rate this is going down leg so it is a waste of review for sure. The third umpire sees a spike when the ball is next to the bat so the not-out stays, and du Plessis gets to his fifty. He doesn't celebrate it twice, though"
11.2,"Nortje to du Plessis, no run","short of a length, no room, opens the face, but can't beat the man at point, who is in tight to save the single"

10.2,"Deshpande to du Plessis, 1 run","into the pitch now, short of a length, slower too, steered to third man"
10.1,"Deshpande to du Plessis, SIX runs","seam-up, in the slot, gentle pace, mid-off is up, and du Plessis accepts this with gratitude, hitting it for a flat six over long-off"
9.6,"Ashwin to Watson, FOUR runs","one carrom ball too many or is it that this just too short? Watson stands there, waits for it, and smacks it back over Ashwin's head for four. No nicety here. Just brute power"
9.5,"Ashwin to Watson, 2 runs",top-edges a sweep over Careys' head. Comes back for what looks like a regulation two but he has to get the skates on in the end
9.4,"Ashwin to Watson, FOUR runs","that is slightly unfortunate for Ashwin. He seems to have got the better of Watson with a wide carrom ball, but Watson throws the trunk in his hand at it, and even off the toe end it flies past extra cover"
9.3,"Ashwin to du Plessis, 1 run","middle and leg, on a length, worked into the leg side for one"
9.2,"Ashwin to du Plessis, FOUR runs","looks like another carrom ball but this time du Plesssis has got under it with the sweep, and has also placed it square of deep midwicket"

8.3,"Axar Patel to Watson, 1 run","slow in the air, on a length, wicket to wicket, pushed to long-off for one"
8.2,"Axar Patel to Watson, FOUR runs","lap sweep, using Patel's high pace, getting inside the line and guiding this fine of short fine. The run rate goes past six"
8.1,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","on a length, slow off the surface, pushed wide of Patel for a tight single"
7.6,"Ashwin to du Plessis, 1 run","is this the legbreak? Or might just be the old-fashioned carrom ball. Short of a length, outside off, just the single down the ground"
7.5,"Ashwin to du Plessis, no run","wide on the crease, and another carrom ball, defeating his sweep, but hits him outside the line"
7.4,"Ashwin to Watson, 1 run","another carrom ball, this time on a length. Middle and leg, and holding its line. Pushed to long-on"
7.3,"Ashwin to du Plessis, 1 run","goes wide on the crease, bowls wide, and is cut away to his deep fielder for one"
7.2,"Ashwin to du Plessis, no run","another carrom ball, du Plessis looks to work to leg and gets a leading edge to cover"

6.4,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","on a length, on off, punched down to long-on for one"
6.3,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, no run",arm ball? Du Plessis is looking to make room but is cramped up by this length ball
6.2,"Axar Patel to Watson, 1 run","on a length, stump to stump, Watson goes back to work this to deep midwicket"
6.1,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","quick length ball, punched to deep cover for one"
5.6,"Rabada to Watson, FOUR runs","nice touch. Short of a length, gives him slight width, and Watson gets off his toes to ride the bounce and guide this between point and short third man. Still the worst Powerplay in Sharjah this year"
5.5,"Rabada to du Plessis, 1 run","collision between du Plessis and Rabada. Both are caught ball-watching. Du Plessis is looking for a quick single to mid-on, Rabada is getting read to collect the throw. Du Plessis runs right into Rabada, but it is du Plessis who is winded. And at the other end, Watson is looking back to see what is happening, and is nearly run out as the throw is at his end. The throw misses, though"
5.4,"Rabada to du Plessis, FOUR runs","on-ace short ball, and du Plessis is ready with his front leg out of the way. He sends a rocket pull into the deep midwicket fence"
5.3,"Rabada to du Plessis, no run","lovely slower ball. Legcutter at 122ks, bouncing extra from short of a lenght as du Plessis looks to make room to pull. The top edge falls wide of Rabada"

5.1,"Rabada to Watson, no run","on a length, wicket to wicket, defended back to him. Rabada yet to be scored off tonight"
4.6,"Nortje to du Plessis, FOUR runs","threads the gap. Slower ball, 128ks, on a length, du Plessis gives himself a bit of room, and hits this to the left of extra cover. DC are excited for a moment because this has been hit in the air and at a catchable height but he has placed it in the gap"
4.5,"Nortje to du Plessis, no run","full and straight, 145ks, hit too well to mid-on to be risking a single"
4.4,"Nortje to du Plessis, FOUR runs","picks his spot, backs away, gets under a short-of-a-length ball and clears midwicket with ease"
4.3,"Nortje to du Plessis, no run","slower ball, 120ks, outside off, on a length, du Plessis bottom edges when looking to go over cover"
4.2,"Nortje to du Plessis, no run","down the wicket, Nortje pulls the length back, and he hits this straight to mid-off on the bounce"
4.1,"Nortje to du Plessis, SIX runs","du Plessis does what Buttler did with some success against Nortje. Bowled up at 141ks, and he gets under it and ramps him over short fine leg"
3.6,"Axar Patel to Watson, no run","quicker, into the pads, pushed to midwicket"
3.5,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","down the wicket, Patel slows down the delivery, pulls the length back, and all du Plessis can do is get a single to cover"

2.5,"Deshpande to Watson, no run","slower ball, on a length, cuts back in, whipped to midwicket"
2.4,"Deshpande to Watson, FOUR runs","imperious. On a length, outside off, and Watson plonks his front foot half-way down, and punches this on the up. Lovely off drive. Between the bowler and mid-off"

2.1,"Deshpande to du Plessis, 1 wide",wide down the leg side

0.3,"Deshpande to Sam Curran, OUT","Deshpande bowls ahead of Rabada, and in three balls he has got Curran out. Sharp short ball, at him, Curran pulls, gets a top edge to third man, where Nortje is back-pedalling, takes it head high, keeps an eye on the rope, releases the ball before stepping over, and then comes back to take the catch"
0.2,"Deshpande to Sam Curran, no run","skids down the wicket second ball, but Deshpande holds his own and fallows him as he backs away. Hits him on the thigh pad"
0.1,"Deshpande to Sam Curran, no run","short of a length, outside off, left alone"
19.4,"Archer to AB, SIX runs","lifted over deep midwicket! Casual. Full and into leg stump, hangs deep in the crease and and brings out a beautiful swing on this lofted flick"
19.3,"Archer to AB, 2 runs","full  and at middle stump, mistimed drive to long-on's left and Gurkeerat has hared the first run down while screaming ""two two two"""
19.2,"Archer to Gurkeerat, 1 run","miscued hook but that will get AB on strike. Short and climbing at the helmet. A feeble fend in the end, but well in front of square leg"
19.1,"Archer to Gurkeerat, 2 runs","lofted to midwicket's right. Low full toss outside off, shuffles into line and scoops that. Maybe looking to go squarer coz square leg is in but he gets two"
18.6,"Unadkat to Gurkeerat, 1 run","yorker outside off, driven along the floor to sweeper's left"
18.5,"Unadkat to Gurkeerat, FOUR runs","connects on one. Slower ball, short and wide outside off. Waits on it and chops it to sweeper's right"

18.4,"Unadkat to AB, 1 run","yorker outside off, jammed out to sweeper cover"
18.3,"Unadkat to AB, SIX runs","swiped over square leg! Too predictable now. Another slower ball dug in at a middle stump line. Waits on it again and nails the pull, to deep square's left"
18.2,"Unadkat to AB, SIX runs","drilled over wide long-on! This is a poor length. Full slower ball at middle, gets the front leg out and clubs that slog to the top tier"
18.1,"Unadkat to AB, SIX runs","waits on that and clobbers it over midwicket. Good length, slower ball at middle. Iwas always going to be that, wasn't it? And AB nails the connection this time. Deep in the crease and clears the big side of the ground by some distance"

17.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Gurkeerat, 3 runs","backward point gets a hand on that at backward point and saves two. Would have been a heck of a catch if he got this one-handed. Full ball outside off, sliced to try and beat point but Unadkat was leaping up with his left hand"
17.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Gurkeerat, no run","slides through under the bat. Yorker in the corridor, gets down and looking to sweep that over square. Not in line and ultimately not close to making connection as that skids past off stump"

17.2,"Kartik Tyagi to AB, FOUR runs","sliced over point! Yorker at off stump, gets deep in the crease and he looks to jam this through the leg side. It pings off the back of his closed face and that's four"

16.6,"Unadkat to AB, 2 runs","survives a miscue into the off side and then possibly a run-out as well. Unadkat outfoxes AB with a cutter at middle stump, rising away from him. He looks to slog, slices into the vacant region to extra cover's right. Unadkat runs over there and throws at the striker's end where AB has gorunded the bat nicely. Extra cover was back on the line in that instance"
16.5,"Unadkat to AB, SIX runs","sliced over sweeper cover. Full and wide outside off, hangs leg side and low of that and then opens the face and lifts it over the off side"

13.3,"Kartik Tyagi to AB, no run","nearly a run-out at the non-strikers end. Gurkeerat would have been out without facing a ball. Good length ball outside off, sliced straight to Jofra at short third. Gurkeerat called and wanted the run while AB was ball-watching. Jofra took a long look and aimed, but couldn't hit the stumps"

13.2,"Kartik Tyagi to AB, no run","short and just outside off, cut on the bounce to backward point"
13.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Kohli, OUT","has Tewatia done enough at deep midwicket? Looks like he has. Kohli is walking back. Full ball angled into Kohli from wide of the crease. he uses the angle and brings out the trademark whip off his his shin. It's flat and fast to Tewatia's right. He takes the catch inches from the line. And is about to fall over. But he lobs it back up with his left hand, then gains his balance again and comes back to take it. Third umpire confirms that was all clean. Brilliant footwork so close to the line. That was traveling quickly to his right too"
12.6,"Tewatia to Padikkal, OUT","dropped slow and short outside off, forces him to try and clear the ground with a pull. Not enough power on that and it's an easy take for Stokes. This isn't too different from the ball Kohli hit for six, except that it's climbing away from a tiring batsman"

8.3,"Tewatia to Kohli, 1 run","backs into the leg side, Tewatia bowls a front-of-the-hand quicker one. It's a full toss and he looks to slog that. Can only get it out to deep midwicket with a couple of bounces. The umpire says no-ball and then overturns it? Not sure if that was a no-ball call or if he was holding his arm out to tell the bowler the batsman isn't ready. Might be the latter given the lack of protests around. Or they checked and he got confirmation that is wasn't above waist height because he was touching his earpiece. Nothing clear at the moment, other than the fact it's not a no-ball"
8.3,"Tewatia to Padikkal, (no ball) 1 run","short and wide outside off, mistimed cut down to long-off. Tewatia's overstepped."
8.2,"Tewatia to Padikkal, no run","tossed up outside off, gets down for the slog sweep and misses again"
8.1,"Tewatia to Padikkal, no run","good length and sliding on outside off, looks for the sweep and is beaten on the under-edge"
7.6,"Unadkat to Kohli, no run","slower ball, dug in at a length and rising past Kohli's bat as he steps out and looks to muscle this through the covers"
7.5,"Unadkat to Padikkal, 1 run","nearly lobs that to short third man. Slower short ball outside off, shapes to pull, loses his shape, then follows with his hands and has a weak jab at that. Tyagi picks up on the bounce at short third and throws to give away a run at long-on via the non-striker's end"
7.4,"Unadkat to Kohli, 1 run","full slower ball outside off, driven to long-off"
7.3,"Unadkat to Padikkal, 1 run","short and outside off, rolls the wrists as he cuts to sweeper cover"
7.2,"Unadkat to Padikkal, no run",past the edge. Good length and keeps coming in with the angle until it pitches and straightens in the corridor. Angled bat on that
7.1,"Unadkat to Kohli, 1 run","slower ball, dug in short of a length at middle stump. Walks down at it and drags the pull to deep midwicket"

6.5,"Tewatia to Kohli, 1 run","full and loopy at leg stump, leans in and pushes to midwicket's right"

5.2,"Unadkat to Kohli, no run","good length and tight at off stump, pushed to midwicket from the crease"
5.1,"Unadkat to Kohli, 2 runs","good length and just outside off. Kohli runs down at it and almost forces himself into opening the face and getting this square. As it turns out, third man is in. Two runs to Jofra's right"
4.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Kohli, 1 run","good length and just outside off, poked to extra cover's left with soft hands"
4.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Padikkal, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven towards mid-off off the toe-end. Has to put in a big dive at the other end as the throw comes in. And it would have saved him if Smith had got the direct hit"
4.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Padikkal, FOUR runs","short and just outside off, waits on it and uses the angle to stab this to short third man's left"
4.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Padikkal, FOUR runs","short and up at the under-arm, hurries him a touch but he's swiveled quickly and managed to squeeze this between keeper and short fine leg"
4.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Padikkal, no run","good length and slanted away, but comes back in off the pitch as he looks to chop this behind point. Beaten on the under-edge"

4.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Kohli, 1 run","good length and just outside off, pushed into the covers with soft hands"

3.4,"Gopal to Padikkal, 1 run","good length on leg stump, whipped to deep square"
3.3,"Gopal to Finch, OUT","taken in the covers. Good bowling from Gopal. Hangs the length ball wide outside off. It's got some overspin on it. Finch is down on a knee trying to slog sweep that, but he's gotten too far away with his leg-side stride and ends up slicing it high. Uthappa takes it at mid-off"
3.2,"Gopal to Padikkal, 1 run","sounds like a dropped catch. Short and just outside off, backs away to cut, but that's impossible to catch. Thick outside edge that takes Samson's left bicep and deflects to short third"
3.1,"Gopal to Padikkal, no run","googly, short and wide outside off, cut straight to backward point"
2.6,"Archer to Finch, SIX runs","chipped over the long-off boundary. Good length and just outside off, half a stride and he's behind the line of it.Offers the full face and simply lifts it on the rise"
2.5,"Archer to Finch, no run",beaten on the outside edge. Short of a length and this one moves away from the seam and past the attempted punch
2.4,"Archer to Finch, no run","short and down leg side, left alone"
2.3,"Archer to Finch, no run",cuts through him. Short of a length and jumping back in from outside off as he swishes down the wrong line
2.2,"Archer to Finch, SIX runs","smoked over square leg! That is some connection. Short of a length at off stump, not a lot of time to move his feet there, but the bat swing across the line is sweet on this pull shot. Rapid hands. It's into the second tier too, 100 metres according to the broadcaster"
2.1,"Archer to Padikkal, 1 run","good length and just outside off, hangs the bat out and gets an inside edge down to fine leg"
1.6,"Gopal to Padikkal, 1 run","good length and into the pads, whipped to deep midwicket's left"

0.1,"Archer to Padikkal, no run","yorker and just outside off, jams the bat down on it and is beaten"
19.6,"Morris to Archer, OUT","appeal for lbw is given out and Jofra reviews right away. Full dipping ball at middle stump, rapped him right in front as he looked to go across that. Inside edge? No, says Ultra Edge. That's smashing leg stump, he was struck right on the toe. That'll remain out and Morris has a fourth"
19.5,"Morris to Archer, 2 runs","low full toss outside off, looks for another heave into the leg side, it's mistimed and bounces out towards long-off"
19.5,"Morris to Archer, 1 wide","full and wide outside off, can't get bat on that"
19.4,"Morris to Archer, no run","good length and wide outside off, swings across the line and is beaten"
19.3,"Morris to Tewatia, 1 run","full and into the body, shoveled to deep midwicket"
19.2,"Morris to Smith, OUT","taken at sweeper cover by Shahbaz. He's a very good fielder, and he's pulled off some nice skill to hang on at the boundary. Full ball outside off, shuffles and goes inside-out. He takes some strides to his right, marginally over-runs it but keeps his bearings and then dives to his right and backwards to hold on. they checked to see if he'd landed ball-first on the turf, but there don't seem to be enough close-up angles of that"
19.1,"Morris to Smith, no run","full slower ball wide outside off, mistimed drive rolls back to the bowler"

18.4,"Udana to Tewatia, no run","full and wide outside off, gets down for the ramp but he cops this on his back knee which was exposed. Past the inside edge and he's down from the impact, can't take the run"
18.3,"Udana to Tewatia, 2 runs","full slower ball outside off, gets down on one knee and slices this to sweeper's right. Kohli swats it into the ground after running t his right"
18.2,"Udana to Tewatia, SIX runs","whipped over midwicket! Low full toss outside off, jumps into line of it and then uses quick wrists for a short-arm whip to use the pace and send it 85 metres"
18.1,"Udana to Smith, 1 run","full slower ball outside off, almost yorker length. Squeezed to deep midwicket off the thick inside edge"
17.6,"Chahal to Smith, 1 run","slow good length ball turning away wide outside  off, reaches out and sweeps down to long-on"
17.6,"Chahal to Smith, (no ball) FOUR runs",reverse whip past point! They had extra cover back. He waits on this full one on middle and swivels the other way and whips it while still upright. And it's another front foot no-ball from Chahal!
17.5,"Chahal to Tewatia, 1 bye",beaten on the reverse sweep. Good length ball turning down leg side and he's through it too quickly. AB doesn't gather cleanly
17.4,"Chahal to Smith, 1 run","full ball tossed up at leg stump, slogs it straight to deep midwicket who takes a clean catch and sends the throw back in quickly"
17.4,"Chahal to Smith, (no ball) FOUR runs","full at off stump, steps out to the pitch of this and launches it over his partner to beat long-on. And that brings up his fifty. He's also rewarded with a free hit as the siren has gone off. Chahal has overstepped"

17.2,"Chahal to Smith, 1 run","full and wide outside off, swept to deep midwicket's left"
17.1,"Chahal to Smith, FOUR runs","swept over point. Full ball outside off, he jumps into a left-hander's stance but the grip is much the same. What matters though is the connection is perfect to send this legbreak to the point boundary"

16.5,"Saini to Smith, no run","full and just outside off, there for the drive but he's gone too eagerly at it. It trickles out to mid-off"

16.3,"Saini to Smith, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked to long-on's right"
16.2,"Saini to Smith, 2 runs",good length and angled into the body. Opens the face and runs it to short third man. His direct hit deflects into long-on's direction and they get a second

15.5,"Morris to Smith, 1 run","full slower ball outside off, shuffles and flicks to deep midwicket"
15.4,"Morris to Smith, FOUR runs",expertly done. Short and into the body. Stays a touch leg side of that and gets this fine of short third man with an angled bat
15.3,"Morris to Buttler, OUT","taken at mid-off. Morris was brought back for the wicket, and he's got the biggest one. Good length and rising just outside off, was looking to slap this over the infield on the up but ended up slicing it"

15.2,"Morris to Smith, 1 run","low full toss on leg stump, flicked to deep square's right"

14.5,"Udana to Smith, no run","full slower ball outside off, driven to extra cover"
14.4,"Udana to Smith, FOUR runs",oh this is just poor bowling. Point and third man are in. And he goes bouncer outside off again. Smith leaps off the ground and chops this over short third
14.3,"Udana to Smith, FOUR runs","oh well placed. Slower ball dropped short and wide outside off, waits on it and deliberately cuts this over point"
14.2,"Udana to Buttler, 1 run","length ball outside off, half a stride across as he clips this into midwicket"

11.5,"Chahal to Buttler, 1 run","good length at middle stump, deep in the crease and whips to deep midwicket"
11.4,"Chahal to Buttler, no run",beaten by the googly. Two googlies to him that he hasn't picked today. This is rising from a length outside off and he was looking to punch through cover

11.3,"Chahal to Buttler, no run","good length and just outside off, pushed to point with the turn"

9.4,"Chahal to Smith, 1 run","good length, slowed right down outside off. Dips on him too. Waits for it to turn and then jabs to point's left. They hesitate with the running but the fiedler hasn't managed to pick it up"

8.1,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Smith, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven to long-off"
7.6,"Chahal to Buttler, no run",leaves the googly alone. Didn't look a convincing leave! Good length ball spinning in from outside off
7.5,"Chahal to Samson, OUT","taken at long-off. Bring out the same banners, it's Samson gone softly again. Somehow, even after a good start, Rajasthan have managed to be three down with lots of overs to spare. This is poor batting from Samson. It's a good length dipping ball wide outside off. He's stuck halfway between slapping this over extra cover and driving it for a single to long-off. Has only managed to loft it to the fielder after reaching out wide for it"
7.4,"Chahal to Uthappa, OUT","taken at deep midwicket. Tossed up full and slow outside off, makes him reach out with the slog sweep and gets gets under it a bit too much. It's high and not very far. Job done, though, you'd say for Uthappa. And job well done"

5.5,"Morris to Samson, 1 run","good length and into the pads, flicked out to deep midwicket"
5.4,"Morris to Stokes, OUT",taken down leg side. Looks like a slower bouncer down leg side. Looks for the pull and is through it too soon. Seems like he only got a glove on that in the end and AB moved nicely to his right to take it
5.3,"Morris to Stokes, no run","yorker at the legs, forces him to jam it down the pitch"
5.2,"Morris to Stokes, 2 runs","short of a length wide outside off, firmly cut to sweeper's left. A check for run out at the non-striker's end as Finch puts in a throw close to the stumps, but Uthappa was back safely"

5.1,"Morris to Stokes, 1 wide","short and wide outside off, left alone"
4.6,"Saini to Uthappa, 2 runs","just out of reach for Kohli running backwards. Short ball just outside off, backs away to make room and looks to pull over mid-on. Kohli sprints and stretches backwards but can't get a hand on this as it plonks into the turf"

4.1,"Saini to Stokes, no run","good length on middle stump, punched uppishly to mid-on"
3.6,"Udana to Uthappa, SIX runs","lofted over the long-on boundary! Good length and pushed across the corridor. Stays still in the crease after the trigger movement and launches this against the angle and on the up, with the full face offered"
3.5,"Udana to Uthappa, FOUR runs","slower ball, short of a good length and across off stump. Shuffles deep in the crease and then gets the weight onto the front foot to pull this over mid-on"

2.6,"Sundar to Uthappa, FOUR runs","finds the square leg boundary again. Walks into the off side, uses the pace and the turn on this delivery outside off and lofts it"
2.5,"Sundar to Uthappa, no run","good length on middle stump, steps out and pushes towards long-on. Can't beat the bowler to his right"
2.4,"Sundar to Uthappa, FOUR runs","swept again and this time aerially. Good length at leg stump, down early and goes with the spin and over square leg"
2.3,"Sundar to Uthappa, no run","good length on middle stump, flicked to midwicket"
2.2,"Sundar to Uthappa, FOUR runs",swiped past backward square. Holds his stance this time and waits on this length ball into the pads. Gets low and finds the vacant boundary at long leg
2.1,"Sundar to Uthappa, FOUR runs",opens up the off side and drives sweetly. Full ball at off and middle. Walks into the leg side to make room and punches firmly to mid-off's left
1.6,"Morris to Stokes, no run","good length and pushed wide outside off, steps out and down leg side. He's made too much room and not given himself a chance to attempt a shot"

16.5,"Green to Pandya, 1 run","nearly a yorker, calmly pushed to long-off to end this early"
16.4,"Green to Pandya, FOUR runs","he over-compensates, goes too short, and gives him width too. Cut over point for four. Deliberately up and over"

15.6,"Cummins to Pandya, no run","bouncer to end the over, and Pandya ducks it"
15.5,"Cummins to Pandya, SIX runs","this is buffet bowling for Pandya. On a length, into the pads, the short boundary on the leg side. He flicks it with his head down, and clears the square-leg fence easily"

15.3,"Cummins to Pandya, no run","bouncer, at him. Pandya ducks it"
15.2,"Cummins to Pandya, FOUR runs","and Pandya stamps his hitting class. Cummins bowls just short of a length with mid-on up, and he drives at it with his head down. Doesn't bother to look up either as he has cleared mid-on with ease"

13.1,"Varun to de Kock, no run","wrong'un, from just outside leg, and takes the leading edge to point. Bounces short"
12.6,"Shivam Mavi to Yadav, FOUR runs","Yadav plonks his back foot across to set up a base to go over the bowler's head, but ends up going over the keeper's head with an outside edge. Just short of that driving length, but the bowler is unlucky here"

10.3,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, OUT","finally a wicket for KKR. Mavi comes back after that disdainful four. This is full, just outside off, Sharma plays for the angle, but it actually pitches and seams away to take the outside edge"

8.4,"Russell to de Kock, SIX runs","bouncer, and it disappears over the short boundary. Pulls this emphatically, and there is no deep square in place anyway. That is fifty for him. He looks in ominous form"

6.5,"Prasidh to de Kock, SIX runs","de Kock is toying with them. Short of a length, straight, and he rocks back to pull him for a flat six over midwicket. Picking on the short boundary"

6.3,"Prasidh to Rohit Sharma, no run","fullish, straight, clipped to short midwicket"
6.2,"Prasidh to de Kock, 1 run","slightly fuller, de Kock respects it and opens the face for a single"
6.1,"Prasidh to de Kock, FOUR runs","de Kock dictating terms here. Not a bad ball, short of a length, straight, but he picks the length early, swivels back and slogs this almost through square leg and along the ground"

4.4,"Green to de Kock, no run","beaten on the sweep this time, but this is headed down leg"
4.3,"Green to de Kock, FOUR runs","always a difficult catch. De Kock gets a massive top edge on the sweep, Varun runs back from short fine, but he has to catch it over his head running back, and they are always tricky. He gets there but can't hold on"
4.2,"Green to de Kock, no run","on a length, the swing back in cramps him up on the cut"
4.1,"Green to de Kock, FOUR runs","full toss, crunched past the bowler for four more. Long-on has no chance of cutting this"

3.1,"Cummins to de Kock, FOUR runs","cracked away. Just short of a length, but de Kock shows no respect. Clears the front leg, hits on the up, and clears wide mid-on easily"
2.6,"Prasidh to de Kock, 1 run","looks for the ramp, but Krishna goes wide at it and concedes just the single to square leg"
2.5,"Prasidh to de Kock, FOUR runs","he is not getting it right. Short, angling away to give him the width, and he is cut in front of backward point for four"

2.3,"Prasidh to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","in the air, catchable high, but pierces the gap between point and cover-point. Wide length ball, swinging away, but he throws his bat at it"
2.2,"Prasidh to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","they are feeding his pull again? After bowling a lovely outswinger, Krishna goes short, and he is not quick enough to bother Sharma, who goes over square leg. Yorks the boundary"
2.1,"Prasidh to Rohit Sharma, no run","lovely outswinger first up. Dipping, on a length, just outside off, moving away late. Just doesn't get the edge"

0.4,"Green to de Kock, no run","again that slight swing , back into the left-hand bat. Defended to leg"
0.3,"Green to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",again that slight swing away from the right-hand batsman. On a length. Worked to leg for one
0.2,"Green to Rohit Sharma, no run","fuller this time, and Sharma is forced to defend"
0.1,"Green to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","starts with an arm ball, which leaves the batsman after pitching, but Rohit late-cuts it between point and cover-point"
19.6,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, SIX runs","excellent finish from Morgan. Coulter-Nile gives him length at 134ks, and Morgan says thank you very much, good sir. Lofts him straight back over his head and into the sight screen"
19.5,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 2 runs","misses the yorker by inches, and Morgan shovels this straight of long-on for two"
19.4,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 2 runs","nails the wide yorker after showing him the wide yorker. He digs it out towards the 30-yard circle, and comes back for two. He is gone for all money, but the throw is wayward. So no new batsman to bowl to"
19.3,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, SIX runs","oh the perfect ball Morgan needs when looking to break free after playing second fiddle. On a length, in his arc, and he has lofted him over long-on for six"
19.2,"Coulter-Nile to Cummins, 1 run","slower ball again, but this time shorter and straighter, Cummins bottom-edges the pull for one"
19.1,"Coulter-Nile to Cummins, FOUR runs","crunched away. Slower length ball, outside off, he stays beside the line and punches this on the up. Neither long-off nor deep cover has a chance of cutting this off. Fifty for Cummins"
18.6,"Boult to Cummins, 1 run","full and wide, dug out to deep cover"
18.5,"Boult to Morgan, 1 run","full, angling in, pushed down the ground for one"
18.4,"Boult to Cummins, 1 run","another full toss, but this time he can't time the shot well. Just the single to deep midwicket"
18.3,"Boult to Cummins, FOUR runs","on-pace full toss, seems like a yorker gone wrong. Cummins shuffles across it, and shovels it square of deep midwicket for four"
18.2,"Boult to Cummins, SIX runs","that de Kock drop is hurting them now. Cummins picks the slower ball early, and slogs it over the short boundary for a six over midwicket"
18.1,"Boult to Morgan, 1 run","full and straight, dug out for one"
17.6,"Bumrah to Cummins, no run",how has de Kock managed to drop this one?. BUmrah has done the job he is asked to do. A wide length-ball slower ball produces the skier that could bring MI the wicket that takes the heat off Coulter-Nile's over. But de Kock has let it slip through his big gloves
17.5,"Bumrah to Cummins, no run","quick high full toss at 143ks, and Cummins is asking for a no-ball. I think this is just before the waist. De Kock does well to collect it as it bounces well in front of him"
17.4,"Bumrah to Morgan, 1 run","yorker, 145ks, middle and off, dug out for a single to extra cover"
17.3,"Bumrah to Cummins, 1 run","on-pace bouncer, Cummins keeps the pull down, gets a single"
17.2,"Bumrah to Morgan, 1 run","slower ball, full, hit hard to long-off for one"
17.1,"Bumrah to Morgan, 2 runs","low full toss, Morgan makes room and drives it back at Bumrah, who sticks his left foot out and the deflection towards midwicket allows them a second"
16.6,"Boult to Cummins, no run","pinpoint yorker, on leg stump, dipping on him. Cummins can inly dig it out back to Boult"
16.5,"Boult to Cummins, no run","slower bouncer, Cummins has shuffled across and leaves it alone. Good height. Won't be called a wide"
16.4,"Boult to Cummins, FOUR runs","that is a reply. Gets stuck into this short-of-a-length delivery. Bowled on-pace, and he goes back to pull this through deep midwicket"
16.3,"Boult to Cummins, no run","Cummins lucky to survive this one. He shuffles across early, Boult goes behind him with a yorker, but it misses the leg stump by inches"
16.2,"Boult to Morgan, 1 run","slower one this time, but it allows Morgan time to go deep into the crease and cut, but Kishan saves three runs with his dive at point"
16.1,"Boult to Morgan, FOUR runs","on a length, on-pace, and Morgan accepts the rare boundary opportunity. Opens the face and goes over point for four"
15.6,"Bumrah to Cummins, no run","you'd think you have had four slower balls and now Bumrah will bowl with pace on, but guess what, he won't. Cummins early into the pull. Excellent over"
15.5,"Bumrah to Cummins, no run","slower bouncer, offcutter, beats Cummins's attempt at the ramp"
15.4,"Bumrah to Cummins, 2 runs","another slower ball, 124ks, but Cummins times it well and makes long-off work to his right to keep this in"
15.3,"Bumrah to Morgan, 1 run","looks to pull, makes a decent connection, but can't beat midwicket"
15.2,"Bumrah to Cummins, 1 run","slower ball again, but this time at 125ks, on a length, outside off, he has to check his shot. Just the single to mid-off"
15.1,"Bumrah to Cummins, no run","massive slower ball, 108ks, dipping full toss, outside off. Does him in completely"
14.6,"Krunal to Morgan, no run","full, nearly a yorker, just outside off, dug out for a dot"
14.5,"Krunal to Cummins, 1 run","short of a length, no pace or room to work with. Just the single to deep cover"
14.4,"Krunal to Cummins, 2 runs","lovely shot. Pandya bowls length outside off, and he chips him inside-out, gets a couple wide of long-off"
14.3,"Krunal to Cummins, 2 runs","slightly back of a length, uses soft hands to place this wide of midwicket and comes back for two"
14.2,"Krunal to Cummins, no run","on a length, middle and leg, pushed straight to short midwicket"
14.1,"Krunal to Morgan, 1 run","quick length ball, punched to wide long-on"

13.1,"Chahar to Morgan, 1 run","short of a length, around off, punched down to long-on"
12.6,"Coulter-Nile to Cummins, FOUR runs","excellent batting. The impetus that they need. Short of a length, just outside off, and he loves the drop in pace. Doesn't matter the length, he goes inside-out, and clears mid-off easily"
12.5,"Coulter-Nile to Cummins, SIX runs","Cummins is loving the bowling of Australia team-mate. He is ready for the short ball, which is not as sharp as Bumrah bowling one, and pulls it into the rope in front of deep square. Small six but six nonetheless"
12.4,"Coulter-Nile to Cummins, no run","short of a length, 137ks, on top of off, defended"
12.3,"Coulter-Nile to Morgan, 1 run","makes room and drives with an open face, gets a single to deep third man"
12.2,"Coulter-Nile to Cummins, 1 run",runs this behind square for one
12.1,"Coulter-Nile to Cummins, FOUR runs","whoa that is a shot and a half. Length ball, 134ks, outside off, opens up the front leg slightly, and drives it on the up and between mid-off and extra cover"
11.6,"Chahar to Morgan, no run","quick legbreak, around off, and then holds its line to cramp him up on the punch. Another dot"
11.5,"Chahar to Cummins, 1 run","short of a length, sits in the surface, pushed down to long-on for one"
11.4,"Chahar to Morgan, 1 run","full, slow, just outside off, driven to long-off"

10.6,"Bumrah to Cummins, 1 wide","bouncer again, loopy one, down the leg side, called wide"
10.5,"Bumrah to Cummins, no run","on a length, shaping in, defended back to him"
10.4,"Bumrah to Russell, OUT","just like that, another bowling change and plan has been executed perfectly. Russell has been backing away to open up the off side, but Bumrah now gives him a sharp bouncer. He has nowhere to go, and looks to duck out of the way. The ball, though, follows his bat and lobs up for an easy catch. Just too good from Bumrah"
10.3,"Bumrah to Russell, no run","Russell backs away again, but this is slightly fuller and slightly straighter, so attacking his stumps more. Russell defends respecfully"
10.2,"Bumrah to Russell, FOUR runs","the quicker they come, the quicker they go. This is an incredible shot. Nothing wrong with what Bumrah has delivered. Short of a length, angling in, on top of off, but Russell has made room and crunched this through point"
10.1,"Bumrah to Russell, no run","short of a length, 142ks, nips back in, hits him on the thigh pad"
9.6,"Chahar to Morgan, no run","legbreak, middle and leg, worked wide of midwicket for one"
9.5,"Chahar to Morgan, FOUR runs","picks the googly this time, gets inside the line early, is waiting for the turn, and then laps it fine for four. Nobody behind square on the leg side"
9.4,"Chahar to Morgan, no run","fuller, but short of driving length, slow in the air, pushed with an open face"
9.3,"Chahar to Morgan, no run","looks to lap him around the corner, but has clearly not picked the wrong'un and is hit on the pad"
9.2,"Chahar to Morgan, no run","length ball, outside off, stays back to push this back to him"
9.1,"Chahar to Morgan, 2 runs","overpitches, Morgan likes it, drives it with an open face. The man at extra cover gets a hand to it"
8.6,"Krunal to Russell, no run","short of a length, around off, pushed to the straight extra cover"
8.5,"Krunal to Russell, SIX runs","Pandya overpitches slightly, gets into Russell's zone, and he slog-sweep this over midwicket. Efficient batting so far. Respect to good balls, but no respect to the scoreboard if he slips into Russell's arc"
8.4,"Krunal to Russell, no run",stays away from Russell's swinging arc. Just short of that length. Defended back
8.3,"Krunal to Morgan, 1 run","looks for the lap, Pandya takes his line wide, Morgan gets bat on it, but can't place it fine of the deep fielder behind square"
8.2,"Krunal to Morgan, no run","on a length, no room, pushed back to Pandya"
8.1,"Krunal to Russell, 1 run","into the pads, on a length, worked away for one"
7.6,"Chahar to Morgan, no run","wrong'un or a slider? Whatever it is, it beats Morgan outside off as it keeps going on with the angle"
7.5,"Chahar to Russell, 1 run","Chahar bowls a teasing legbreak, but just too full, and is driven to extra cover"
7.4,"Chahar to Karthik, OUT","back-to-back. Kathik has played on a spinner again. And once again it is a wide legbreak. Last game it was Chahal, this game it is Chahar. One leggie learning from the other? Slow and wide, Karthik looks to lap it regardless, and only ends up showing the ball the way to his own wicket"
7.3,"Chahar to Gill, OUT","Gill takes a risk after playing 22 balls for 21 runs, and holes out. Chahar is not giving him the swinging length, but the strike-rate pressure on Gill shows as he goes for this regardless. Looks to hit a six over long-on, but because he is not close to the pitch of the ball, he gets no power in this. Pollard takes an easy catch at long-on"
7.2,"Chahar to Gill, 2 runs","a touch too straight, placed wide of deep square, and they come back for two"
7.1,"Chahar to Gill, no run","short of a length, around off, punched away straight to extra cover"
6.6,"Krunal to Karthik, FOUR runs","lovely placement. He has got a short ball, and he has not looked to pull this for a six. He just rocks back and pulls this in front of deep square and square of deep midwicket"
6.5,"Krunal to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover for one"
6.4,"Krunal to Karthik, 1 leg bye","Karthik backs away again, and Pandya follows him again. Off the pad this rolls to short third man"
6.3,"Krunal to Karthik, no run","looks to make room, the wily Pandya follows him, cramps him up, and draws another dot"
6.2,"Krunal to Karthik, no run","down the leg side, but it seems to have hit the pad on the way through"

5.4,"Coulter-Nile to Karthik, no run","short of a length, around off, hits the splice of the bat as he defends"
5.3,"Coulter-Nile to Rana, OUT","good comeback from Coulter-Nile. The short-ball plan gets Rana again. Almost as if you can add an extra ""i"" to his name. He did play this one like the more illustrious Raina does. Looks to get inside the line of this bounce to try to help it along to fine leg but all he manages to do is, glove it through to de Kock"
5.2,"Coulter-Nile to Gill, 1 run","makes room to cut this, but NCN has a deep cover in place to keep them to one"
5.1,"Coulter-Nile to Gill, FOUR runs","listened to you, dear reader. To be fair, NCN has provided him a plum half-volley, and he has just put it over mid-on for four"
4.6,"Krunal to Rana, no run",already signs the ball is topping. Rana looks to work this to leg but ends up getting a soft leading edge back to the bowler
4.5,"Krunal to Gill, 1 run",worked wide of mid-on this time
4.4,"Krunal to Gill, no run",the shot of a man batting on 11 off 14 inside a Powerplay. Skips down the track with nowhere to go as Pandya pulls the length back. Bounces just short of mid-on
4.3,"Krunal to Rana, 1 run",uppishly hit wide of Pandya for a single down to long-on
4.2,"Krunal to Rana, no run","length ball angled across him, left alone"
4.1,"Krunal to Gill, 1 run","slight turn, full, middle and off, pushed to long-off for one"

2.6,"Boult to Tripathi, OUT","short, wide again, and Tripathi fails to keep the cut down. However, this has come right out of the screws, but it can't go past Surya Kumar Yadav at point. Smart catch, high to his left. Even Boult is impressed"
2.5,"Boult to Tripathi, FOUR runs","short, well outside off, but Tripathi pulls this away wide of mid-on. Keeps it down. Makes sure he doesn't go to deep cover, which will get him just the single"

2.3,"Boult to Tripathi, 1 run","short of a length, rib-high, short-arm pull. Gets a single to long leg"
2.2,"Boult to Tripathi, no run","short of a length, outside leg, headed towards middle. Tucked away to square leg"
2.1,"Boult to Tripathi, no run","Tripathi gets the width he wants, and swings at this. The ball, though, pitches and seams away to beat his drive"
1.6,"Coulter-Nile to Gill, no run","short of a length, straight, pushed back to him"
1.5,"Coulter-Nile to Tripathi, 1 run","slightly fuller, straighter, pushed towards mid-on for a risky single. This time Kishan misfields, allowing them to make it easily"
1.4,"Coulter-Nile to Tripathi, no run","on a length, headed for top of off, draws the respect it deserves"
1.4,"Coulter-Nile to Tripathi, 1 wide",one more wide down the leg side. NCN not happy with himself
1.3,"Coulter-Nile to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, pushed wide of cover"
1.2,"Coulter-Nile to Gill, FOUR runs","full and straight, pushed wide of mid-on, and Bumrah's dive there is sloppy. Not sure if he has got a bad bounce. Gone for four"
1.2,"Coulter-Nile to Gill, 1 wide",another wide down the leg side
1.2,"Coulter-Nile to Gill, 1 wide","looking for more swing, but ends up sliding it down leg"
1.1,"Coulter-Nile to Gill, no run","starts with an outswinger, 135ks, on a length, just outside off. Left alone"
0.6,"Boult to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, just outside off, uses soft hands to take a single left of cover"
0.5,"Boult to Gill, no run",some seam movement from just back of a length. Leaves him. Defended back to him
0.4,"Boult to Gill, no run","on a length, swinging back in towards off, punched to mid-off"
0.4,"Boult to Gill, 1 wide","excellent bouncer, 133ks, rising sharply, just outside off. Left alone. De Kock makes a one-handed take overhead. Called wide"
0.3,"Boult to Gill, no run","full and straight, looking for swing, Gill looks to play to mid-on, gets a leading edge to mid-off"
0.2,"Boult to Tripathi, 1 run","swing there. Tripathi plays late because of it, and Rohit Sharma misfields at short midwicket to let him get off strike"
0.1,"Boult to Tripathi, no run","on a length, just outside off, defended with an open face"
19.6,"Chahal to Pooran, SIX runs","just clears long-on! Just past long-on's outstretched right hand. Chahal tosses it up slow like he has all over, but this one is fuller. So Pooran steps out and meets it as a full toss. It comes off the toe-end and Morris is stretching to his right at long-on but it's past him"
19.5,"Chahal to Rahul, OUT","run-out! Gayle is walking off! Oh KXIP, how, time and again, do you make it so complex for yourselves? This is lovely bowling from Chahal, offering no pace on it and landing it short of a length outside off. Rahul punches it to cover and takes off instinctively. Gayle is not the man to complete that single at this point in his career. It's a clean pick up, it's a one-bounce throw, and it's a new batsman on strike for the last ball"
19.4,"Chahal to Rahul, no run","just short of catching point! Slow, short of a length and turning away outside off. Cut on the bounce to the fielder lunging forward"
19.3,"Chahal to Gayle, 1 run",lovely work from Padikka; at deep midwicket. This one is tossed up wide too and Gayle reaches and lofts the sweep. Padikkal has an awkward bounce to his right after running across and he does supernly to pat it in on the half-volley with one hand
19.2,"Chahal to Gayle, no run","loopy legbreak foxes Gayle. Whew that spun in a long way, tossed up wide and at a length and he left that alone"
19.1,"Chahal to Gayle, no run","good length and turning into leg stump, pulled on the bounce to midwicket"

17.1,"Morris to Gayle, 1 wide",full and curving away outside off. Beaten on the cover drive
16.6,"Sundar to Gayle, 1 run","short of a length and turning away outside off, waits on it and punches to long-off to bring up his fifty. Holds a pose for the cameras, points to the sticker on the bat that says The Boss. And then points to the name on the back of the shirt"
16.5,"Sundar to Rahul, 1 leg bye","short and down leg side, cops the pull on his thigh"
16.4,"Sundar to Gayle, 1 run",good length and gripping outside off. Waits on it and hammers to long-on's right
16.3,"Sundar to Gayle, SIX runs",lifted over long-on again. Some Chinnaswamy flashbacks? Short of a length arm ball hurries him on the back foot. It's a short-arm pull and it's far enough behind that fielder
16.2,"Sundar to Gayle, no run","good length, tossed up wide outside off and turning away. Left alone"
16.1,"Sundar to Gayle, SIX runs","pulled wayyyy over long-on. Short and up at middle stump, hangs back in the crease and gets a clean swinging arc at this. Muscles it off the back foot"
15.6,"Siraj to Gayle, 1 run",low full toss squeezed out to deep backward square with a slog
15.5,"Siraj to Rahul, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
15.4,"Siraj to Rahul, SIX runs","helps it over the roof. Short ball up at hip height, on middle stump. Head right on top of that from KL Rahul as he pulls from under it and sends it a long way"
15.3,"Siraj to Gayle, 1 run","yorker at off stump, forced to jam that down to long-off"
15.2,"Siraj to Gayle, SIX runs","launched over extra cover! Goes with the angle this time and nails the connection. Good length and angled away from the corridor, front leg out, reaches out, slapped on the rise"
15.1,"Siraj to Gayle, FOUR runs","good length and just outside off, he swings against the angle across him and manages to get it over the bowler. Mid-off is in and long-on can't get it"
15.1,"Siraj to Gayle, 1 wide","short of a length and wide outside off. Deliberately pushed away with the angle, beaten on the swish"
14.6,"Saini to Gayle, 1 run","low full toss on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
14.5,"Saini to Gayle, no run","beaten on the slog again. Short of a length and across the corridor, looks to cart that in midwicket's direction on the rise"
14.4,"Saini to Gayle, no run","good length at middle stump, defended to extra cover"
14.3,"Saini to Rahul, 1 run","slower short ball into leg stump, backs away and cuts to point's right"
14.2,"Saini to Gayle, 1 run","just short of long-on. Good length at middle stump, looks to slug that wide of long-on but it came off the toe-end"
14.1,"Saini to Gayle, no run",beaten. Good length ball sliding across the corridor. Front leg into the leg side and a big slog at that
13.6,"Morris to Gayle, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket's left"
13.5,"Morris to Rahul, 1 run","good length and in at middle stump, allows it on and pushes into the leg side to bring up another fifty this season"
13.4,"Morris to Gayle, 1 run","full and into the pads, pushed straight to midwicket and he steals a run"
13.3,"Morris to Gayle, no run","overpitched just outside off, driven on the bounce to extra cover"
13.2,"Morris to Gayle, no run","that is plumb if there's no bat on it. Oddly enough though, it's Gayle who asks Rahul if there was bat on it. And then he reviews. How would the non-striker know? But the review might be a good one anyway there's a spike on Ultra Edge as ball goes past bat. It was a yorker that pinned him on the back toe in front of middle. He survives"
13.1,"Morris to Rahul, 1 run","good length outside off, driven on the rise to sweeper's left"
12.6,"Sundar to Gayle, SIX runs","walks into the leg side and swipes him over deep square. Took some steps early and made Washington think. It's a full ball at middle stump, nice angle towards the leg side too and Gayle goes down on a knee and lofts this"
12.5,"Sundar to Rahul, 1 run","short at middle, shoveled out to deep backward square"
12.4,"Sundar to Gayle, 1 run",good length and slanted in at middle. Punched to long-on
12.3,"Sundar to Gayle, SIX runs",gets one full and uses it. Sundar errs in length for the first time tonight and this is slugged over his head. Just short of a driving length and Gayle uses his reach and goes straight
12.2,"Sundar to Rahul, 1 run","short at leg stump, pulled to deep backward square"
12.1,"Sundar to Gayle, 1 run","good length outside off, dragged off the low part to long-on"
11.6,"Siraj to Rahul, SIX runs","and again! Sower ball this time, at a good length outside off and once again he clears the front leg and swings across the line. This one is straighter, more wide long-on than midwicket"
11.5,"Siraj to Rahul, SIX runs",out of the stadium! Good length and just outside off. Angled into him. He gets the front leg in the leg side and slogs across the line for a sweet connection. Over the roof at midwicket
11.4,"Siraj to Gayle, 1 run","full and wide outside off, lunges at that and throws the bat out. Loses his footing and nearly falls over. Inside edge into the square leg region"
11.3,"Siraj to Rahul, 1 run",good length and into the pads. Swiped on the bounce to fine leg
11.2,"Siraj to Rahul, no run",good length ball jumps up in the corridor as he shapes for the cut. Forced to poke it into the covers

8.6,"Sundar to Gayle, 1 run","good length and holding in the pitch outside off. Upright drive, thick edge to short third man's left"
8.5,"Sundar to Rahul, 1 run","dropped short and down leg side. Firmly pulled, but on the bounce to deep square"

8.2,"Sundar to Gayle, no run","good length and at off stump, blocked on the front foot"
8.1,"Sundar to Rahul, 1 run",short and into leg stump. Swiped to deep backward square's right
7.6,"Chahal to Agarwal, OUT","loses his shape this time! And gets a wave goodbye from the bowler, who wins the battle. Lovely bowling. Tosses another one up, gets it to dip at leg stump, and Mayank goes across the line. He's cramped himself for such a shot because the front leg is not out of the way. Hits the top of middle"
7.5,"Chahal to Agarwal, SIX runs","drilled over the bowler. Lovely shape on that. It's been all balance from him tonight. This is tossed up at middle stump, gets a stride out to meet it on the pitch and holds his position to lift this straight"
7.4,"Chahal to Rahul, 1 run","full on off stump, driven out to sweeper cover"
7.3,"Chahal to Agarwal, 1 run","googly, good length and into leg stump. Nudged to deep midwicket's right off the back foot"
7.2,"Chahal to Rahul, 1 run",good length and dipping on off stump. Leans in and pushes to point's right with the turn
7.2,"Chahal to Agarwal, 4 wide","good length and down the pitch, beaten on the attempted glance. and AB is beaten too. Short third and short fine both sprint back for this. The former drags it back in"
7.1,"Chahal to Agarwal, no run",good length and slowed down at middle stump. Looks for the flick as that turns away but can only get it back down the pitch
6.6,"Siraj to Agarwal, 1 run","short and just outside off, on the front foot and under this as he looks to pull. Top edge falls short of fine leg"
6.5,"Siraj to Agarwal, FOUR runs","sliced over point. Good length and just outside off. Got his front leg into the leg  side and opens the face at it. Not sure if he wanted it there, looked like was an attempt to go over extra cover"
6.4,"Siraj to Agarwal, no run","short ball up at off stump, too eager to get the pull away and gets the cue-end on this into the off side. Disappointed with himself, midwicket was in"
6.3,"Siraj to Rahul, 1 run","full and just outside off, flowing drive straight to extra cover where Kohli fumbles"
6.2,"Siraj to Agarwal, 1 run","good length and just outside off, opens the face and runs it to third man"
6.1,"Siraj to Agarwal, 2 runs","good length and into leg stump, gets down on a knee and whips this over midwicket. Long-on and deep square converge on that and combine"
5.6,"Udana to Agarwal, 1 run","full toss at leg stump, patted out to mid-on"
5.5,"Udana to Agarwal, SIX runs",lofted over wide long-on! Agarwal waits on the slower ball and lofts it into the leg side. Held his balance. It's a dipping wristspinner at middle stump and he got his weight into it
5.4,"Udana to Agarwal, no run","full slower ball down leg side. Looks to sweep that and is down on a knee, but that's off the thigh guard and AB slides to his left to stop"
5.3,"Udana to Rahul, 1 run","good length slower ball at middle stump, clips this to midwicket's right"
5.2,"Udana to Agarwal, 1 run","full slower ball on off stump, check-punch off the front foot to mid-off"
5.1,"Udana to Rahul, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to sweeper cover on the rise"
4.6,"Saini to Agarwal, FOUR runs","lovely batting. More pristine striking from Mayank. This is full and just outside off, half a stride out and the perfect connection with the full face offered to get this over Saini"
4.5,"Saini to Rahul, 1 run","short and just outside off, mistimed cut into the pitch. Another direct hit at the non-striker's end"
4.4,"Saini to Agarwal, 1 run","direct hit at the non-striker's end as Mayank stretches. Good length and just outside off, a crisp punch on the rise to Udana's left at mid-off. He picks up cleanly and swivels to hit the stumps but the bat is grounded"
4.3,"Saini to Agarwal, no run","short of a length and in at middle stump. Opens up his stance to try and drop this into the off side for a single, but he's timed it too well"
4.2,"Saini to Rahul, 1 run","good length and at off stump. Punched into the covers, everyone is back on the circle there"
4.1,"Saini to Rahul, SIX runs","a casual swipe over midwicket. Good length and just outside off, but with the angle into him. Half a stride out and a still head as he goes across the line. Looks like it lands full on the boundary padding"
3.6,"Chahal to Agarwal, FOUR runs","and again. Lovely batting, this. Full ball tossed up outside off, stride out to meet that one on the pitch and goes inside-out again with the turn. Wide of long-off once more, and over the line after a bounce"
3.5,"Chahal to Agarwal, FOUR runs","dropped short at middle stump, gets deep in the crease and brings out the short-arm pull to deep midwicket's right"
3.4,"Chahal to Agarwal, no run","short and just outside off, under-edge on the cut to point"
3.3,"Chahal to Agarwal, SIX runs","oh that is graceful. Good length and dipping on him outside off, also turning away. But he's waited on that with half a stride and gone with the turn, on the up and to long-off's right. All hands, that"
3.2,"Chahal to Rahul, 1 run","full and into the pads, gets forward and flicks to square leg's left"
3.1,"Chahal to Rahul, no run","full and into the pad. Looks to flick and walks into that, pad first. That slid on off the pitch"
2.6,"Morris to Rahul, 1 run","slower short ball at off stump. Backs away, makes room and looks to clear the off side infield. Gets an inside edge to short fine's right"
2.5,"Morris to Rahul, SIX runs",lifted to deep square leg's right. Short and up at the chest. Nicely in position for the pull this time and into the ad board
2.4,"Morris to Rahul, no run","short ahd down leg side, 143kph and past his attempted hook"
2.3,"Morris to Rahul, 2 runs",good length and into the body. Nudges it towards mid-on where Siraj is too eager on the throw and misfields
2.2,"Morris to Agarwal, 1 run",full slower ball at middle stump. Checks himself as he looks to flick. Trickles to midwicket's right
2.1,"Morris to Agarwal, 2 runs","good length and into the pads, uses the angle and flicks to deep square's left"

0.1,"Morris to Rahul, no run",good length and some shape away outside off. Pushed into the covers off the under-edge
19.6,"Shami to Morris, SIX runs","lifted over deep square! Full toss angled into leg stump, allows that on and helps it over that fielder. Off the low part of the inside half, but it's good enough"
19.5,"Shami to Morris, SIX runs","launched over long-off! This is poor bowling from Shami, the plans are all over the place. This is a good length ball, a slower one, just outside off. Morris walks into the leg side and drills this flat"
19.4,"Shami to Udana, 1 run","low full toss outside off, sliced to extra cover's left and past his dive"
19.3,"Shami to Udana, SIX runs",oh that sounded so sweet! Whew! A bouner up at the throat and following him down leg side. He has nailed this pull. Flies over deep midwicket
19.2,"Shami to Morris, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked on the bounce to deep square"
19.1,"Shami to Morris, FOUR runs","scooped over short fine. Savvy batting from Morris. It's a yorker at middle stump, he drops his right shoulder and steps into the off side to make room and nails the connection"
18.6,"Jordan to Morris, 1 run","full outside off, mistimed slog to long-on"
18.5,"Jordan to Morris, no run",full and wide outside off as Morris is walking way down into the leg side. Was too far down to get a bat on this

18.2,"Jordan to Morris, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punched on the up to mid-off"

17.6,"Shami to Udana, 1 run","short ball just outside off, clears the front leg and looks to pull. Thick inside edge to deep square"
17.5,"Shami to Kohli, OUT",Rahul lunges to his right to take this and Kohli's gone. Slower bouncer down leg side. He looks for the hook into the turf. Is through it early and that pings off the glove and to Rahul's right. Taken comfortably and Shami has AB and Kohli in the same over. Looked like a knuckle ball
17.4,"Shami to Kohli, 2 runs","full at off stump, steps out and punches to long-off"
17.3,"Shami to AB, OUT",taken at extra cover. Full and just outside off. Wants to loft this over mid-off. Ends up getting that off the toe-end with the bat turning in his hands. And it's an easy take for the backpedaling Hooda
17.2,"Shami to AB, no run","beaten on the pull. Slower ball, short of a good length and wide outside off. Slides through from under the shot"
17.1,"Shami to Kohli, 1 run","good length outside off, mistimed slog to long-on's right"
16.6,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run","good length at off stump, watchfully nudged to extra cover's left"

16.1,"Ashwin to AB, 1 run",full and tossed up wide outside off. Mistimed drive out to sweeper as he reaches out
15.6,"Jordan to Dubey, OUT",taken by Rahul in the short fine leg region. Jordan has his first wicket of the season. Bouncer up at his left shoulder. Swipes from under it and takes his eyes off the ball. Ends up slicing it. Rahul with a short sprint to the right to take that. Jordan punches the air and breathes a sigh of relief. It's been a difficult tournament for him until tonight
15.5,"Jordan to Kohli, 1 leg bye","full and into the pads, looks for the whip behind square again and cops that on the pad"
15.5,"Jordan to Kohli, 1 wide","legcutter, good length and down leg side. Beaten on the whip"

14.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Dubey, 2 wide","good length and down leg side, can't gather that cleanly, the keeper"
14.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Dubey, SIX runs","muscled over deep midwicket! Presumably this is what the left-hander was sent out to do, take on the leggie. It's another googly. Good length and at middle stump. A clean slog sweep, and effortless to get that 76 metres in midwicket's direction"
14.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Dubey, SIX runs","that's out of the stadium. Googly, short and at middle stump. Jumps onto the back foot and pulls it over long-on"

12.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Kohli, 1 run","good length at middle stump, punched to deep midwicket off the back foot"
12.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Kohli, no run","lovely work at extra cover from Agarwal. Lunges low to his left to look for the catch off this aerial drive, but it's short of him. But recovers immediately and has Kohli scrambling back"

10.5,"Ashwin to Dubey, no run","beaten by a googly he hasn't picked. Good length outside off, ripping away and past his attempted poke"
10.4,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run","googly, full outside off, driven to long-on's left"
10.3,"Ashwin to Sundar, OUT","taken at long-on. That's the end of the Washington experiment. A googly, landed at leg stump on a good length. He was looking for the slog sweep, a no-look slog sweep. Ended up slicing it high and Jordan took that safely with a few strides to his left"
10.2,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run","full outside off, driven a bit too well to long-off's left this time to steal a second"

9.4,"Maxwell to Sundar, no run","good length on off stump, pushed back to the bowler with the turn"
9.3,"Maxwell to Sundar, FOUR runs",short and fired down leg side. Sundar loses his footing trying to reach this but it works. Swished fine using only his right hand

9.1,"Maxwell to Sundar, 1 run","full and into leg stump, flicked to deep square's left"

6.4,"Ashwin to Sundar, no run","googly, short of a length and outside off. Cut to backward point"
6.3,"Ashwin to Finch, OUT",bowls him with another beauty. Finch caught on the back foot again as Ashwin lands this quick legbreak on middle stump. This time the bat's facing long-on and the ball's past the outside edge to knock off stump
6.2,"Ashwin to Finch, FOUR runs",dropped. Good length and turning away from the corridor. Looks for the cut and gets a thick edge that brushes Rahul's gloves. Gayle is too wide at slip to get a hand on it
6.1,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run","short and outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
5.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Finch, no run",short of a length and angled into middle stump. Backs away and cuts to point

4.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Kohli, FOUR runs","good length on leg stump, allows that on and flicks to deep square's right. Hooda slides to his right and gets in a tangle after getting behind it. As he looks to get up, one leg is in contact with the padding as the other gets the ball bouncing onto the ankle"
4.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Kohli, FOUR runs",punched past extra cover. Good length and just outside off. Gets the weight onto the front foot and check-punches it to Pooran's right
4.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Finch, 1 run","slower ball, short and wide outside off. Cut to sweeper's left"
4.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Kohli, 1 run","full slower ball just outside off, pushed into the covers off the front foot"
4.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Padikkal, OUT",straight to short extra. Another punch at a ball that stops on him. This one is good length and outside off. He checks the attempted drive and can't do enough to stop this floating straight out at Pooran
3.6,"Shami to Padikkal, 1 run","good length at middle stump, punches with hard hands and it ends up a chip to mid-off's left"
3.5,"Shami to Padikkal, SIX runs","pick-up shot to deep square's right. Overpitched on leg stump, a deliberate aerial flick. It's not too far to the fielder's right, just a few metres, but it was away from him quickly"
3.4,"Shami to Finch, 1 run",short-arm pull to the square leg's right. Walks into this short ball and has to be quick with his hands. as it cramps him at the chest
3.3,"Shami to Padikkal, 1 run",short and up at the ribs.A bit too quick onto him as he swivels for the pull. Gets it out to deep square
3.2,"Shami to Finch, 1 run","good length and in at middle stump, walks down the track and flicks to deep square"

2.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Finch, 1 run","good length and just outside off, pushes it into the covers with soft hands to steal a run from Pooran who fumbles"
2.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Finch, no run",
2.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Finch, no run",thick outside edge. A slower ball to start. Full and just outside off. Reaches out at it with hard hands. Once bounce and into a tumbling Gayle's hands
1.6,"Shami to Finch, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, hurriedly nudged off the inside edge to square leg's right"
1.5,"Shami to Finch, FOUR runs","chipped straight. Still walking down, is Finch, possibly to cut out the inswingers. This one is just short of a good length and climbing in from outside off. He offers the full face and gets the over his partner off the inside half"
1.4,"Shami to Finch, no run",short ball and ends up down leg side. Finch walks down at him again and is forced to leave this
1.3,"Shami to Finch, no run","good length and just outside off, jumps into line and flicks to midwicket's right"
1.2,"Shami to Finch, 4 byes","through him and past the keeper. Short of a good length, jagging back sharply off the seam. Finch walked down at it and was well beaten on the inside edge. But that kept dipping away and away from Rahul's left-handed reach"
1.1,"Shami to Padikkal, 1 run","good length on leg stump, pushed to midwicket from the crease"
0.6,"Maxwell to Finch, SIX runs","swiped over the long leg boundary. Good length ball at leg stump, gets low on it and clears the infield. On this ground, you only clear the infield at a decent height to get six"

0.4,"Maxwell to Padikkal, 1 run",good length and onto the pads. Flicked to square leg's right

19.5,"Deshpande to Gopal, FOUR runs","full and wide, swings hard, and edges it over short third man for four"
19.4,"Deshpande to Tewatia, 1 run","there won't we a tie. Full ball, Tewatia looks to hit this to leg, and skies vertically. Deshpande is ambling towards the catch and runs into Gopal. Misses on a wicket but he has sealed the game"
19.3,"Deshpande to Tewatia, no run","low full toss, nearly a yorker. Dug out. Can't do much better"
19.2,"Deshpande to Gopal, 1 run","yorker, dug out, back to Tewatia"
19.1,"Deshpande to Tewatia, 1 run","this is awful cricket from Shreyas Gopal. Deshpande bowls slow, and he bowls wide, and Tewatia goes after it. This is a mis-hit but it is travelling, and Rahane catches it running back but he knows he is not going to be able to stay in so he throws it back in. Tewatia is absolutely filthy with Gopal for not running back"
19.1,"Deshpande to Tewatia, 1 wide","slower ball, full and wide, Tewatia stands his ground and takes the wide"
18.6,"Rabada to Tewatia, 1 run","short ball, pulled wide of long-on, but he turns down the second. He wants strike for the last over"
18.5,"Rabada to Gopal, 1 run",yorker to Gopal. Just the single to mid-off
18.4,"Rabada to Archer, OUT","Rabada has delivered what Dhawan asked for. This is nearly a yorker. Quick one. And even though it is not a yorker, there is still not enough room to get under. All he manages to do is scoop it out to point"
18.3,"Rabada to Archer, no run","Archer gets the length ball to swing at, but Rabada is quick, at 148ks, and it bounces over his big swing"
18.2,"Rabada to Archer, no run","slower short ball, wide outside off, 123ks, and it squeezes under his big pull to leg"
18.1,"Rabada to Tewatia, 1 run","makes room, Rabada goes for the off stumps. Tewatia gets bat to this low full toss for a single to long-off"
17.6,"Nortje to Tewatia, 1 run","low full toss, signs off with another 151.6ks delivery, pushed wide of mid-off but not wide enough to get more than one"
17.5,"Nortje to Tewatia, no run","slower offcutter outside off, Tewatia looks for the sweep and is beaten"
17.4,"Nortje to Archer, 1 run","he gets length, but it gets big on him as he swings. The mis-hit brings him one to long-on"
17.3,"Nortje to Uthappa, OUT","lovely bowling. A yorker at the base of middle and leg stump at 149.7ks. After trying the ramp, Uthappa charges at Nortje, and he spears in this massive yorker. This is just too good for Uthappa"
17.2,"Nortje to Tewatia, 1 run","Nortje goes for a length ball, Tewatia swipes across it, gets a massive top edge towards third man. Rabada is kept fine there but he can't get to it. And for the second time tonight, he recovers well after having been done in by the spin"
17.1,"Nortje to Uthappa, 1 bye","he tries the ramp like Buttler did earlier, but Nortje bowls the slower offcutter at 128ks. They take the bye as the ball bounces in front of Carey and he can't make a clean connection"
16.6,"Rabada to Tewatia, no run","slower short ball, Tewatis picks it, he pulls it in front of square, but he finds the man at midwicket. He hits his bat with his glove because he knows he has missed out here"
16.5,"Rabada to Tewatia, FOUR runs","that will ease some nerves. Cheeky, and perfectly executed. Rabada continues with the plan of bowling short and at the body of his former DC team-mate. This time he arches his back and ramps him over the wicketkeeper's head"
16.4,"Rabada to Uthappa, 1 run","sets himself up for the pull again, but this is the slower short ball. Gets an inside edge into his body. Just the single"
16.3,"Rabada to Uthappa, 2 runs","quicker short ball, a touch late into it, but manages to clear midwicket in the circle"
16.2,"Rabada to Uthappa, no run","short ball, Uthappa looks to pull, but this is a slower legcutter at 127ks, and the leading edge lobs wide of him. Rabada dives full length but can't get to it"
16.1,"Rabada to Tewatia, 1 run","short, chest-high, no room, he dabs it down for a single to point"
15.6,"Ashwin to Tewatia, 1 run","quicker, flatter, this time he has placed it wide of point for a single"
15.5,"Ashwin to Tewatia, no run","really slow this time, stump to stump, defended with an open face. Uthappa refuses the single"
15.4,"Ashwin to Tewatia, no run","quick length ball outside off, he plays with an open face to point"
15.3,"Ashwin to Tewatia, no run","flat, quick, short of a length, defended back to him"
15.2,"Ashwin to Tewatia, no run","really slow, but not full enough. Tewatia defends"
15.1,"Ashwin to Uthappa, 1 run","carrom ball, he sees it off the pitch and opens the face to get a single to deep point"
14.6,"Deshpande to Uthappa, 1 run","slower ball, wide, on a length, slogged to deep midwicket for one"
14.5,"Deshpande to Tewatia, 1 run","short again, quick too, pulled down this time. Happy with the single"
14.4,"Deshpande to Uthappa, 1 run","on a length, 140ks, angling in, uppishly driven for a single to long-on"
14.3,"Deshpande to Uthappa, 2 runs",driven in front of deep cover
14.2,"Deshpande to Tewatia, 1 run","Nortje has dropped it. What a chance this is. This is actually a good ball to bowl to Tewatia because he likes to help it along with the pull. So you have the fine leg back and bowl into his underarm. Tewatia offers the catch, but Nortje can't hold on. Quite a regulation catch"
14.1,"Deshpande to Uthappa, 1 run","wide length ball, times the drive well, gets a single to deep cover"
14.1,"Deshpande to Uthappa, 1 wide",wide down the leg side as he goes wide on the crease and angles it too far
13.6,"Axar Patel to Uthappa, 1 run","slower again, worked to leg for one"
13.5,"Axar Patel to Uthappa, FOUR runs","Uthappa takes the big risk. The reverse-sweep after four dots and a run-out. This is a quick length ball, and he can use the pace to clear short third man"
13.4,"Axar Patel to Uthappa, no run","slow through the air, just outside off, defended back to him"
13.3,"Axar Patel to Uthappa, no run","quick, on a length, outside off, pushed to cover-point. They don't run off the msifield"
13.2,"Axar Patel to Uthappa, OUT","Parag is run out. Really slow in the air, Uthappa looks to work this to leg, but because there is on pace to work with, he doesn't get the ball wide enough of Patel. Uthappa charges down the wicket, and then sends Parag back. He has nowhere to go. He can only wish Patel misses, but he takes his time, steadies his aim, and goes for the base of the middle stump"
13.1,"Axar Patel to Uthappa, no run","quick length ball, 95ks, pushed to cover"
12.6,"Nortje to Parag, no run","on a length, 151.4ks, just outside off. Defended solidly"
12.5,"Nortje to Uthappa, 1 run","full, on off, pushed down to long-on for one"
12.4,"Nortje to Uthappa, SIX runs","pace is your friend, pace is your enemy. Especially when defending small totals. Quick bouncer, Uthappa late into it, gets a top edge, but it sails comfortably over fine leg"
12.3,"Nortje to Uthappa, no run","full, tailing in, 149.4ks, dug out to short midwicket"
12.2,"Nortje to Uthappa, FOUR runs","even Rahane can't do anything about this one. Short and wide from Nortje, and he has cut it away in front of point"
12.1,"Nortje to Uthappa, no run","short of a length, wide, punched square, and Rahane dives at point to save at least one, possibly even four runs"
11.6,"Axar Patel to Uthappa, 1 run","leading edge, uppish, but wide of the diving Patel"
11.5,"Axar Patel to Parag, 1 run","length ball, outside off, punched to long-off for one"
11.4,"Axar Patel to Samson, OUT","massive wicket. Axar Patel hits back. Lovely arm ball, quick, 97ks, Samson looks to make room but the ball slides on hit the middle stump. Samson is left anguished as he walks back"
11.3,"Axar Patel to Uthappa, 1 run","full, outside off, pushed slightly wide of cover, and Samson puts in a dive to make it"
11.2,"Axar Patel to Uthappa, no run","on a length, slight turn from just outside off, played straight to cover-point"
11.1,"Axar Patel to Samson, 1 run","flat, into the pads, pushed down to long-on for one"
10.6,"Deshpande to Uthappa, FOUR runs",and he walks down the wicket to this free hit and gets an inside edge past short fine leg for four
10.6,"Deshpande to Samson, (no ball) 1 run",no-ball so a free hit next ball. I did mention before the start of the match that he has a reputation for bowling no-balls in Ranji Trophy
10.5,"Deshpande to Uthappa, 1 run",run down to third man for one
10.4,"Deshpande to Uthappa, no run","appeal for obstructing the field. The third umpire wants to know if Uthappa has ""seen the throw and changed his direction"". This is pushed down the ground, Deshpnade gets a hand to it, which is why Samson sends him back. Uthappa runs between the throw from mid-on and the wicket, but he has not changed his direction to come in the way of the ball. But he has changed his direction beforehand to come in the way of where the direct hit will travel. Cheeky, and not-out"
10.4,"Deshpande to Uthappa, 1 wide","bouncer first up, 141ks, but it is too high and is called a wide"
10.3,"Deshpande to Samson, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, runs this down to third man for one"
10.2,"Deshpande to Stokes, OUT","Deshpande holds his own against a batsman intent on dominating. Stokes jumps out of the crease, and he bowls a slower one at 121ks. He is way early into the shot, and ends up holing out to long-on. Deshpande is over the moon"
10.1,"Deshpande to Samson, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, steered down to third man"
9.6,"Ashwin to Stokes, no run","shuffles across to punch this wide offbreak, but straight to short extra cover"
9.5,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","really slow in the air, 81ks, clipped off the toes for one"
9.4,"Ashwin to Stokes, 1 run",the second less-than-100% hit to deep midwicket this over. Again first bounce to the fielder. This is pulled away
9.3,"Ashwin to Stokes, no run","quick arm ball, Stokes is cramped on the punch, but he does well to keep this out"
9.2,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","offbreak, middle and leg, worked to leg for one"
9.1,"Ashwin to Stokes, 1 run","slog-sweep to the left of deep midwicket, Rabada is running full pelt, and then the ball spins to his right. Rabada does to brake and stick his right hand to field"
8.6,"Axar Patel to Samson, SIX runs","like the London buses, sixes arriving in a bunch for Axar Patel. By pumping him down the ground last over, Samson has now shortened his length and rocks deep into his crease to pull this over midwicket for another massive six"
8.5,"Axar Patel to Stokes, 1 run",driven to deep cover for one
8.4,"Axar Patel to Samson, 1 run","flat, on a length, into the pads, punched down to long-on"
8.3,"Axar Patel to Stokes, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to deep cover for one"
8.2,"Axar Patel to Stokes, FOUR runs","quick length ball, but Stokes still plays the reverse ramp, and gets enough timing on it to clear short third man"
8.1,"Axar Patel to Samson, 1 run","quick, flat, Samson is expecting it. Rocks back to pull it to deep midwicket"
7.6,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","carrom ball? Bowled at 91ks, looks like slipping down leg, turns back towards the stumps, takes an inside edge for a single to short fine leg"
7.5,"Ashwin to Stokes, 1 run","drifting into the pads, worked to deep square for one"
7.4,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","Samson shuffles across early, Ashwin slips in a quick ball down leg. He gets the bat down in time. Single to short fine"
7.3,"Ashwin to Stokes, 1 run","on a length, middle and leg, pushed to long-on for one"
7.2,"Ashwin to Stokes, FOUR runs","misses the line, short of a length, well down leg, and he goes on a knee to help him over short fine for four"
7.1,"Ashwin to Stokes, no run","length ball, middle and leg, defended back to him"
6.6,"Axar Patel to Samson, no run","short of a length, no room, bottom edge on the attempted cut"
6.5,"Axar Patel to Stokes, 1 run","quick, into the pads, worked to leg for one"
6.4,"Axar Patel to Samson, 1 run",goes back to punch this flat delivery to extra cover
6.3,"Axar Patel to Samson, SIX runs","nothing watchful about this. The first six off Axar Patel this IPL. What a lovely clean strike. Samson skips down the wicket, also makes a little room, and swings him clean over his head for a huge six"
6.2,"Axar Patel to Samson, no run","turn for Patel. On a length, just outside off, and Samson plays him back watchfully"
6.1,"Axar Patel to Stokes, 1 run","on a length, wicket to wicket, worked to deep midwicket for one"
5.6,"Rabada to Stokes, 1 run","big wind-up, wide length ball, hit wide of mid-off for one"
5.5,"Rabada to Stokes, no run","short ball, this time the quicker one, and Stokes doesn't time the pull well. Straight to midwicket"
5.4,"Rabada to Samson, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, runs this down to third man for one"
5.3,"Rabada to Stokes, 1 run","short of a length, no room, but still punched to deep cover for one"
5.2,"Rabada to Stokes, FOUR runs","slower ball, 126ks, short, on the pads, and Stokes pulls this disdainfully in front of square. The deep fielder doesn't have far to go to his right, but this is timed so well it keeps getting away from him"
5.1,"Rabada to Stokes, no run","short of a length, outside off, mis-hits the punch outside off"
4.6,"Nortje to Stokes, 1 run","Has Iyer dislocated his shoulder? No he hasn't, but he is in pain. Lovely on-the-up drive to this quick short-of-a-length ball, and Iyer makes a dive to his left at mid-off to save three runs. But he has landed awkwardly, and is in pain and is going off the field"
4.5,"Nortje to Stokes, no run","full and straight, 153ks, get out of here. Consistent 150-plus bowling for two overs. Punched well but straight to mid-on"

4.2,"Nortje to Stokes, no run","Another 150-pkus delivery, Stokes shows he is good enough to time it after making room. But straight to point"
4.1,"Nortje to Stokes, no run","full, on off, punched to mid-off. This is at 154ks"
3.6,"Ashwin to Smith, OUT","lovely bowling. Lovely cricket in these four overs. Hitting, innovation, pace and now guile. Ashwin slows this down by at least 10-12ks, and he bowls it scrambled-seam. Smith is playing for the offbreak, which it looks like, but goes straight on because of the imperfect (if you will) seam position. Leading edge results in an easy catch"
3.5,"Ashwin to Smith, no run","short of a length, quicker, Smith backs away and is hit on the inside edge"
3.4,"Ashwin to Smith, no run","flatter offbreak, tucked to square leg"
3.3,"Ashwin to Stokes, 1 run",leading edge as Ashwin bowls a slow offbreak on the pads. Gets a single
3.2,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run","really slow offbreak, placed between midwicket and square leg"
3.1,"Ashwin to Stokes, 1 run","full, middle and leg, pushed wide of midwicket"
2.6,"Nortje to Buttler, OUT","bowled'im. Nortje has his own back. This is all fast and furious at 155.4ks. Nortje sticks to his (speed) guns, and keeps attacking the stumps with fast bowling. This time Buttler tries the more orthodox shot down the ground, and is beaten by the seam movement to lose his middle stump. Don't hear a pundit criticising him for playing orthodox shot when the unorthodox ones were bringing him the results. That is how they sound when they criticise innovation"
2.5,"Nortje to Buttler, FOUR runs","and he has done it again. Backs away, then shuffles across, this is bowled at 156ks, but he takes it from outside off and ramps him fine of short fine"
2.4,"Nortje to Buttler, FOUR runs","welcome to the Buttler clinic on T20 batting. After a six first ball, he shuffles all over the crease before getting inside the line of a full ball and ramps him up and over short fine"
2.3,"Nortje to Stokes, 1 run","backs away, Nortje is quick, 152.1ks, and Stokes is hitting point when looking to go over cover. Just the single"
2.2,"Nortje to Buttler, 1 run","full and straight, 152.3ks. late inswing defeats his shot. Just the leg-bye"
2.1,"Nortje to Buttler, SIX runs","oh what a welcome. Length ball, 148ks, no room, but he has casually and dreamily lofted him over long-on. What an exhibition these two guys are putting on"
1.6,"Deshpande to Buttler, 1 run","straight length ball, pushed to mid-on for one"
1.5,"Deshpande to Stokes, 1 run","goes full, outside off, pushed straight of mid-off for one"
1.4,"Deshpande to Stokes, FOUR runs","lovely batting. The sound off that bat. Uff. Walks at it, gives himself some room, and punches him through extra cover. This is not a bad ball really. Short of a length, not too wide"
1.3,"Deshpande to Stokes, no run","tightens the line this time, and Stokes defends in front of off"
1.2,"Deshpande to Stokes, FOUR runs","oh lovely. As good as the Dhawan punch earlier in the night. Short of a length, outside off, and he drives it on the up, past extra cover"
1.1,"Deshpande to Buttler, 1 run","and nearly a wicket first ball. Length ball, into the pads, 140ks, Buttler early into closing the face, but the leading edge clears Deshpande"
0.6,"Rabada to Buttler, 1 run","on a length, angling in, pushed in front of square leg for one"
0.5,"Rabada to Buttler, FOUR runs","as dreamy as Buttler's voice. Wide half-volley, and he leans into it, and push-drives it through cover. This is Rabada at 150ks"
0.4,"Rabada to Stokes, 1 run","Rahane misses the run-out. Too full, dug out straight to Rahane at short cover, and he is gone for all money. Rahane has missed"
0.3,"Rabada to Stokes, no run","again, middle and leg, angling towards off, quite quick. Defended again"
0.2,"Rabada to Stokes, no run","corrects the line. On a length, quick, on off, defended"
0.1,"Rabada to Stokes, FOUR runs","lovely nonchalant shot first up. Rabada bowls the rare loosener. On a length, but outside leg, and there is no deep square leg in place. Clipped away for four"
19.6,"Unadkat to Axar Patel, OUT","big slower ball, at 99.9ks, wide outside off, and Patel is nowhere near it. Toe-ends this for a catch to short third man"
19.5,"Unadkat to Axar Patel, FOUR runs","on-pace to Patel, a low full toss outside off. Axar can't hit this for a six, but he manages to place this wide of long-off and times it well enough"
19.4,"Unadkat to Carey, OUT","slower ball. Smart bowling. Bowl on pace to the Indian batsman, who has faced a lot of you. Go slow to the Australian, who has hardly faced you in the past? Wide length ball, offcutter, mis-hit to long-off"
19.3,"Unadkat to Axar Patel, 1 run","full toss, on-pace, hits the high part of the bat. Just the single to long-on"
19.2,"Unadkat to Axar Patel, 2 runs","full, wide and on-pace it seems. Not the cleanest of connections but gets this into the gap between long-off and deep cover"
19.1,"Unadkat to Carey, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, wide, punched to deep cover, the bigger part of the ground"
18.6,"Archer to Stoinis, OUT","short ball, a little ball of fire, quick and wide, getting big on him. Stoinis looks for the hook but goes only as far as deep midwicket"
18.5,"Archer to Carey, 1 leg bye","angling in, full and fast, just the leg-bye"
18.4,"Archer to Stoinis, 1 run","full and straight, just short of being a yorker, whipped to leg, but straight to deep midwicket"
18.3,"Archer to Carey, 1 run",he tries that but can't get this high full toss past point. It is a knee-high full toss
18.2,"Archer to Stoinis, 1 run","low full toss, can't get under it, just the single to long-off"
18.1,"Archer to Carey, 1 run","high full toss, no power in the shot. Just the single to mid-off"
17.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Carey, 1 run","lovely yorker outside leg, right at his heel. Just the single. No boundary in the 18th over. Excellent effort"
17.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Stoinis, 1 run","deep in the crease, moving across, but Tyagi stays accurate with the yorker. Just the single to long-on"
17.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Stoinis, 2 runs","yorker, just outside off, placed wide of deep midwicket for two"
17.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Stoinis, no run","Stoinis moves away early, looking to hit over, and Iyer slips a full and wide one to earn a dot"
17.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Carey, 1 run","full and straight again, pushed to long-on for one"
17.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Carey, no run","full, straight, pushed to cover. No run"
16.6,"Archer to Carey, 1 leg bye","what a comeback from Archer. He is shorter, quicker and straighter, hitting him on the arm. They take a leg-bye but I am not sure he tried to play a shot here. The umpire should have been more vigilant. He was neither playing a shot nor taking evasive action. Sort of let the ball hit him"
16.5,"Archer to Carey, SIX runs","lovely shot. Picks the short boundary and goes for it. Archer is quick and short and into the body, but Carey makes room and cuts this chest-high bouncer over point for a flat six"
16.4,"Archer to Stoinis, 1 run","yorker, 147ks, outside off, dug out towards long-off for one"
16.3,"Archer to Carey, 1 run","full, angling in, punched down to long-on for one"
16.2,"Archer to Carey, 2 runs","quicker full ball, 145ks, high full toss, punched past point. Ruled to be not high enough to be called a no-ball"
16.1,"Archer to Carey, no run","slower ball, 131ks (you read it right), hit back to Archer"
15.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, OUT","he might have missed out on the lbw earlier, but gets his man now. Wide on the crease, wide length ball, Iyer looks for another six down the ground, but the extra bounce means he holes out to long-off"
15.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Stoinis, 1 run","yorker, middle and leg, he opens the front leg, digs it out for a single to fine leg"
15.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Stoinis, no run","short ball, 138ks, at him, Stoinis looks for the ramp and is beaten. The third man is up, which is why Stoinis lets out a grunt on missing out on a boundary"
15.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, 1 run","it sounds like timber, but it is not. Iyer is moving around the crease to play with his length, but Tyagi bowls the perfect yorker on the middle stump. Iyer gets the bottom edge to survive this one. Oh hello, this has hit the toe first. So a plumb lbw not appealed for"
15.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, no run","short of a length, angling in, pushed straight to midwicket"
15.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Stoinis, 1 run","wide on the crease, length ball, hit hard but gets just the single to long-on"
14.6,"Unadkat to Iyer, SIX runs","has Stokes taken the most incredible catch?. Has he got rid of the ball in time, though? Iyer has mistimed this slog, Stokes settles himself under it at deep midwicket, but it is a little too big for him. He has to be airborne beyond the boundary to catch this, so he has very little time to get rid of it before his foot comes down. Replays show the ball is in his hand as he flicks it back in. That is a six, but a great effort in the field to even give himself a chance to catch this. Fifty for Iyer now"
14.5,"Unadkat to Iyer, 2 runs","offcutter short ball, pulled wide of long-on, and they come back for two. Not one on-pace delivery this over"
14.4,"Unadkat to Iyer, SIX runs","Iyer has started picking the slower ball already. He delays the shot, keeps his head down, and slogs this length ball over wide long-on"
14.3,"Unadkat to Stoinis, 1 run","slower ball again, punched down to long-off for one. Unadkat needs to watch out that he doesn't become too predictable like Nagarkoti did the other night"
14.2,"Unadkat to Iyer, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, angling in, pushed to deep midwicket for one"
14.1,"Unadkat to Stoinis, 1 run","on a length, angling in towards top of off, pushed into the covers"

13.5,"Gopal to Iyer, 1 run","legbreak, on a length, starts from outside leg, punched to long-on for one"
13.4,"Gopal to Stoinis, 1 run","on a length, outside leg, he makes room and punches this down to long-off"
13.4,"Gopal to Stoinis, 1 wide",big wide down the leg side as this comes out of the hand late
13.3,"Gopal to Stoinis, FOUR runs",incredible power. The high grip and the late unfurling of the wrists and he hits this shortish ball over midwicket and wide of long-on
13.2,"Gopal to Stoinis, no run","flatter, into the pads, punched to extra cover after making room"
13.1,"Gopal to Stoinis, no run","full, slow, middle and leg. Stoinis thinks of the big one, but reins himself in and defends this back"
12.6,"Tewatia to Iyer, 2 runs","Iyer tries the big reverse sweep, Tewatia stays outside off, and it seems he has got a bottom edge on it. Tewatia seems to be suggesting this is leg-byes, but the replays show he has gloved it between the keeper's legs for two"
12.5,"Tewatia to Iyer, FOUR runs","full and wide, within Iyer's reach and he chips it over extra cover for four"
12.4,"Tewatia to Iyer, no run","lovely bowling. Defensive line wide outside off, but not much turn and it stays inside the wide line as he leaves it alone"
12.3,"Tewatia to Iyer, no run","fuller, legbreak, wide, cut away to point"
12.2,"Tewatia to Iyer, no run","wide length ball, some turn, punched straight to extra cover"
12.1,"Tewatia to Stoinis, 1 run",punched uppishly to long-on. On two bounces
11.6,"Gopal to Stoinis, 1 run","length-ball legbreak, punched down to long-on for one"
11.5,"Gopal to Iyer, 1 run","length ball, around leg, worked against the turn to leg for one"
11.4,"Gopal to S Dhawan, OUT","and Dhawan perishes trying to force the pace. Looks for the reverse sweep, Iyer stays wide outside off, and the slowness and extra bouncer means he gets a top edge for an easy catch at short third man"
11.4,"Gopal to S Dhawan, 1 wide","slider, short, wide, angling away, and called a wide"
11.3,"Gopal to Iyer, 1 run","on a length, around leg, pushed to midwicket for one"
11.2,"Gopal to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, pulled hard, wide of long-on, hit a little too well to think of a second"
11.1,"Gopal to S Dhawan, SIX runs",he is hitting everything beautifully today. Right out of the middle of the bat as slog-sweeps this length ball over midwicket. Special innings. Showing why he worth persisting with
10.6,"Tewatia to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched down to long-on for one. Fifty for Dhawan"
10.5,"Tewatia to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, straight, punched down to long-on for one"
10.4,"Tewatia to S Dhawan, 1 run","flat, into the pads, worked to short fine leg for one"
10.3,"Tewatia to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","inside-out chip, just a touch too full, and he goes over extra cover. All touch"
10.2,"Tewatia to S Dhawan, no run","wrong'un, around off, pushed to short cover again"
10.1,"Tewatia to S Dhawan, no run","on a length, outside off, pushed to short cover"
9.6,"Stokes to Iyer, no run","wide low full toss, driven with an open face, but a diving save at point denies them runs"
9.5,"Stokes to Iyer, 2 runs","another incredible shot. A good tight short ball, but Iyer ramps it even as he is ducking for a couple"
9.4,"Stokes to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, pulled away to deep midwicket"
9.3,"Stokes to Iyer, 1 run","Dhawan is nearly run out but the overthrow allows them a single. Hit straight to short midwicket, Dhawan is sent back, but Tewatia misses with the throw"
9.2,"Stokes to Iyer, FOUR runs","incredible shot. It id a free hit all right, but it is quite a good one. Short at him, Iyer is in no position to attack it but slaps it back over his head for four. Not even off the middle of the bat"
9.2,"Stokes to S Dhawan, (no ball) 1 run","beamer, seems like a slower ball gone wrong, pulled away to long leg for one"
9.1,"Stokes to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, straight, tucked away off a length"
8.6,"Gopal to Iyer, 1 run","slow through the air, Iyer pushes in front of his body, gets a single"

8.2,"Gopal to S Dhawan, 1 run","wrong'un, on a length, outside off, cut away to deep cover for one"
8.1,"Gopal to Iyer, 1 run",pushed wide of Gopal for a single to long-off
7.6,"Tewatia to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","slow-sweep to a flat legbreak, can't get under it, hits it flat and low to the left of deep midwicket. Samson takes the risk, charges at it and dives. Doesn't make it. Concedes four. Slight misjudgement, but you can't fault him here. He saw a chance to take a wicket and committed to it. Not a moment of hesitation"
7.5,"Tewatia to Iyer, 1 run","pushed wide of midwicket, but not wide enough to think of a second"
7.4,"Tewatia to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, dabbed away to point for one"

5.5,"Kartik Tyagi to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","slower ball, short of a length, well outside leg, and Dhawan loves this line, helping this along past short fine leg with a delayed pull"
5.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, quick, hits the inner half of the bat. Single to leg"
5.3,"Kartik Tyagi to S Dhawan, 3 runs",shuffles across to look to hit this to leg. Doesn't get the right length so he pushes this towards midwicket. A misfield allows him runs
5.2,"Kartik Tyagi to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","Dhawan is hitting the ball harder than he has all IPL. He is looking in excellent touch. This is not a bad ball, but Dhawan punches it on the up, past cover, with immaculate timing"
5.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, around off, worked into the covers for one"
5.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, 1 wide","wide on the crease, big angle down the leg side. Wide"
4.6,"Stokes to Iyer, 1 run","slower ball, full and straight, worked to leg for one"
4.5,"Stokes to Iyer, FOUR runs","Iyer shuffles across early, then makes room, gets a length ball and lofts it over mid-on. Not the cleanest of connections but enough on it to clear mid-on"
4.4,"Stokes to S Dhawan, 1 run","big slower ball, 116ks, Dhawan slogs and is caught at mid-off. Just the one off the free hit"
4.4,"Stokes to Iyer, (no ball) 1 run","on a length, angling in, worked to leg for one"
4.3,"Stokes to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, pushed wide of point for one"
4.2,"Stokes to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","cracking shot. Dhawan is in some mood today. Stokes pitches short, and wide, and Dhawan is on the front foot and cuts in well in front of point"
4.1,"Stokes to S Dhawan, no run","on a length, outside off, driven on the up, but hit too hard to be taking a single to mid-off"
3.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, no run","Stokes makes a full-length diving save at point. This is cut hard, but Stokes is alert and acrobatic"
3.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, no run","bouncer from wide on the crease, 138ks, Iyer ducks it"
3.4,"Kartik Tyagi to S Dhawan, 1 run","on a length, around off, punched to deep cover. That is his deep fielder. Shouldn't be bouncing him as he did last ball"
3.3,"Kartik Tyagi to S Dhawan, SIX runs","flat pull for a six. Short ball at 138ks, rib-high, and Dhawan loves it. Helps it along over short fine leg. Also the line is too leg-side"
3.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, 1 run","on a length, angling in, 141ks, punched to mid-on for one"
3.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, no run","on a length, outside off, pushed to short cover"

2.5,"Archer to Iyer, 1 wide","bouncer, outside off, 148ks, and he is wided on height"
2.4,"Archer to Iyer, no run","short of a length, outside off, and he is hit on the splice too. The bottom hand comes off as he pushes. This is bowled at 151ks"
2.3,"Archer to Rahane, OUT","and Rahane goes. Playing with fore when you look to slog Archer at this pace. Heavy length, quick, and gets big on him. Goes off the splice of the bat to mid-on"
2.2,"Archer to Rahane, no run","short of a length, 149ks, not much room. Rahane looks to steer it, but is beaten by both pace and bounce of this"
2.1,"Archer to Rahane, no run","length ball, outside off, 145ks, hits the bat high again as Rahane defends"
1.6,"Unadkat to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","that is cracking. He likes Unadkat's pace. Sets back, moves across, gets inside the line and short-arm pulls this over midwicket"
1.5,"Unadkat to S Dhawan, 2 runs",moves across the line to work this wide of mid-on for two
1.4,"Unadkat to S Dhawan, no run","on a length, shaping in towards off, punched back to him"
1.3,"Unadkat to S Dhawan, no run","there is definite seam movement around. Dhawan jumps out of the crease, Unadkat drags the length back, it jags away and beats him"

1.1,"Unadkat to Rahane, no run","wide length ball, Rahane tries a big drive at it, ans is beaten by the angle. Perhaps slight seam too"

0.5,"Archer to Rahane, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, steered down to third man"
0.4,"Archer to Rahane, no run","full, swinging in, pushed to mid-on"
0.4,"Archer to Rahane, 1 wide","pace like fiyah. And a poor wide call. Short of a length, 148ks, around off, nips back in, Rahane does well to save himself from being hit. Goes under the armpit. Called wide"
0.3,"Archer to Rahane, no run","seam again. Archer looking unplayable. Or at least unhittable. Seams from just short of a length, and hits him high on the pad"
0.3,"Archer to Rahane, 1 wide",wide down the leg side. Seems to be jagging around
0.2,"Archer to Rahane, no run","seam again, and extra bounce. Hits the handle of the bat. Bowled at 147ks, on a length"
0.1,"Archer to Shaw, OUT","bowled'im, first up, what a beauty. Lovely seam position, just short of a length, outside off. Shaw pushes at it, and the ball hits the seam and jags back in to take the inside edge onto the middle stump"
19.6,"Bravo to Natarajan, no run","full and dipping away from him outside off, has a big swing and can't connect"
19.5,"Bravo to Sandeep, 1 run","full slower ball on off stump, backs away and drives on the bounce to mid-off"
19.4,"Bravo to Sandeep, no run",yorks him as he walks down leg side. Beaten
19.3,"Bravo to Nadeem, OUT",slower ball at a good length on leg stump. Looks for the slog and skies it up pitch side. Bravo yells mine and settles under that to take the catch and close any realistic mathematical chances for SRH
19.2,"Bravo to Nadeem, no run","followed down leg side with a yorker again, and cops that on the boot. Can't get it away"
19.1,"Bravo to Nadeem, no run","yorker down leg side, and he can't get bat on the attempted slog as he walks into the leg side"
18.6,"Thakur to Rashid Khan, OUT","taken at long-on. Low full toss outside off, looks to play the helicopter shot but once again he's not behind the line of this for that shot. Holes out. Oh but he's also got so deep in the crease that his back leg has pushed off stump back."
18.5,"Thakur to Rashid Khan, no run","full and wide outside off, can't get the attempted drive away"
18.4,"Thakur to Nadeem, 1 run","full and just outside off, backs away and chops it straight to point. Watson is close in and picks up but doesn't throw"
18.3,"Thakur to Rashid Khan, 1 run","full toss outside off, wants to ramp it over square leg who is in the circle. But he hasn't got behind that"
18.2,"Thakur to Rashid Khan, no run","full yorker floating away from him outside off. Reiffel shaped to call it a wide, hands half out. Then the bowler protested and, so did Dhoni. And suddenly he rethinks it. Replays show it had curved past the line"
18.2,"Thakur to Rashid Khan, 1 wide","full ball floats away again, and this time it's past the tramline. Left alone"
18.1,"Thakur to Rashid Khan, 2 runs","scythed to sweeper's right. Full toss wide outside off, floated away a touch and he hung back and had a whip at this"
17.6,"Karn to Nadeem, FOUR runs","lofted over extra cover! Dhoni is furious with his bowler. He's put the sweeper square and Karn's lobbed this full ball up outside off. Nadeem reaches out with a stride and nails the lofted drive into the vacant boundary. ""Nahiiiii,"" you could hear. No. And then a big chat with him as he walks to his fielding position."
17.5,"Karn to Rashid Khan, 1 run",just short of deep backward point. Good length and gripping and turning outside off. Backs into the leg side and looks to go over extra cover. Ends up getting too far from it and slices
17.4,"Karn to Rashid Khan, FOUR runs","reverse sweep over backward point. Good length ball dug into off stump, rising slowly, but he gets under this and nails the execution"
17.3,"Karn to Rashid Khan, SIX runs",long-on tips it over the line. Steps out at this ball and turns it into a full toss. Ends up slicing the attempted slog a touch. Thakur runs to his left and lunges up. Can't catch that
17.2,"Karn to Williamson, OUT",taken at long-on. The plan's come off. Williamson reaching out for the slog sweep as Karn tosses it up slow and at a length outside off. Can't manage to get the power on that to clear the boundary
17.1,"Karn to Williamson, FOUR runs","lofted over square leg. That was the gap in the leg, and he hits it there. Good length ball at middle, shuffles and lofts the pull"
16.6,"Bravo to Williamson, 1 run","full slower ball outside off, jammed to extra cover"
16.5,"Bravo to Williamson, FOUR runs",finds the vacant midwicket boundary to bring up fifty. There's a rwason he's considered one of the best in the world. The plan from Bravo is clear with the wide yorkers. He walks into the off side to open up the leg side. He gets a low full toss and he chips it
16.4,"Bravo to Shankar, OUT","taken at deep backward point. Full and wide, that's the plan, and that's what the field is set for. Shankar reaches out and slices it straight to Jadeja"
16.3,"Bravo to Williamson, 1 run","full outside off, driven on the bounce to extra cover's left. Missed out on that. Chawla did well to throw himself at that, face first. A boundary for sure if that got past him"
16.2,"Bravo to Shankar, 1 run","overpitched outside off, lofted drive to long-off's right. Bit eager to get this one away"
16.1,"Bravo to Shankar, SIX runs","sweeps him over wide long-on! That is sweetly hit, wow. Good length and dipping in from outside off. He's down on one knee and uses his reach to send this 90 metres"
15.6,"Chawla to Shankar, 1 run",good length and sliding on into the corridor. Gets forward and manages to eat Chawla's laboured dive to the right with this push
15.5,"Chawla to Williamson, 1 run","short outside off, whipped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
15.4,"Chawla to Williamson, 2 runs","short outside off, steered to deep midwicket's left off the back foot"
15.3,"Chawla to Shankar, 1 run","googly, short of a length outside off. Tucks it to deep midwicket's right but hit a bit too well for the second"
15.2,"Chawla to Shankar, 2 runs",short of a good length at middle. Shuffles and tucks it to deep midwicket's right
15.1,"Chawla to Williamson, 1 run","googly, good length and outside off. Allows it on and dabs to short third"
14.6,"Karn to Williamson, 1 run","good length on off stump, punched to deep extra cover's right. Curran is rapid there and stops them going back for a second"
14.5,"Karn to Shankar, 1 run","tossed up at off stump, driven with the turn to long-off"
14.4,"Karn to Garg, OUT","picks out deep midwicket! A clean lofted sweep from Garg, hit powerfully enough that he might have got a four a couple of metres to Jadeja's right. But he's got this from off stump and straight into the hands"
14.3,"Karn to Garg, 2 runs","good length at leg stump, gets back in the crease and expertly pats this into vacant midwicket. Soft hands calibrated for a second run"
14.3,"Karn to Garg, 1 wide","tossed up and wide outside off again, left alone again"
14.3,"Karn to Garg, 1 wide",tossed up full and very wide outside off. Left alone
14.2,"Karn to Williamson, 1 run","short at middle, hurried pull towards long--on"
14.1,"Karn to Garg, 1 run",good length and turning away from middle. Gets an inside edge on the attempted sweep that trickles into the leg side
13.6,"Bravo to Williamson, 2 runs","good length and just outside off, punched to sweeper's right"
13.5,"Bravo to Williamson, FOUR runs","tickled fine. Short of a good length, slanted into leg stump. He had shuffled so had enough room to jab at this and get is past Dhoni's dive"
13.4,"Bravo to Garg, 1 run","slower ball at a length outside off, leans in and flicks to midwicket's left"
13.3,"Bravo to Garg, FOUR runs",oh neatly done. So subtle. Good length  and just outside off. Watches that right under his eye as he gets on the front foot and opens the face late to chop to backward point boundary
13.2,"Bravo to Garg, no run",good length and into leg stump. Looks to flick and cops that on the thigh
13.1,"Bravo to Garg, no run","good length at middle stump, shuffles and flicks to midwicket"
12.6,"Karn to Garg, 1 run","full outside off, leans in for the drive to deep extra cover"
12.5,"Karn to Garg, no run","tossed up at off stump, shapes to sweep, adjusts to hurriedly drive to point"

12.1,"Karn to Garg, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep backward square's left"
11.6,"Jadeja to Williamson, FOUR runs","oh gorgeous. Full and just outside off, leans in to reach the pitch and goes inside-out to chip this over extra cover. ""Nahhhhh,"" says Dhoni, presumably about Jadeja's length"
11.5,"Jadeja to Williamson, FOUR runs","slapped over extra cover. Short and gripping outside off. Waits on it, opens up the body and deliberately lifts it over the fielder"

9.6,"Jadeja to Garg, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, patted past his partner off the front foot"
9.5,"Jadeja to Bairstow, OUT","hits middle stump! Classic stuff from Jadeja. Cramps him, ties him, induces the false shot. Good length and tight on the stumps again. Bairstow looks to whip into the leg side and is beaten on the inside edge"
9.4,"Jadeja to Bairstow, no run",good length and sliding into middle. Can't get the punch past extra cover
9.3,"Jadeja to Bairstow, no run","good length and into middle stump, onto the back foot and mistimes the attempted punch into the off side"

7.6,"Jadeja to Bairstow, 1 run","good length on middle, punched to long-on"
7.5,"Jadeja to Bairstow, no run",appeal for lbw turned down. Not reviewed. Was looking to play the reverse sweep. Good length and gripping. Might have hit his chest too so it was on its way up. Perhaps also hitting just outside off
7.4,"Jadeja to Bairstow, 2 runs",good length and in at off stump. Allows that on and opens the face late to jab this to sweeper's left
7.3,"Jadeja to Williamson, 1 run","tossed up on middle, drives with the turn to long-off"
7.2,"Jadeja to Williamson, 2 runs","short and just outside off, cut to sweeper's left"

5.6,"Sam Curran to Williamson, no run",good length and into the stumps. Defended off the back foot
5.5,"Sam Curran to Williamson, FOUR runs",steered over backward point and has Warner smiling in the dugout. Slower short ball angled into him. Arches into the leg side to make room and jabs at it late. Third man was in
5.4,"Sam Curran to Williamson, 2 runs","slower ball at a length, angled into the body. Nudged to midwicket's right"
5.3,"Sam Curran to Williamson, no run","lbw appeal turned down. Slower ball at a length on leg stump. Looks for the flick and cops that in front of leg. Curran is around the wicket, remember. That's likely sliding down. Dhoni has a chat this time. No review. That was going down and might have too high as well"
5.2,"Sam Curran to Williamson, no run",good length and slanted into the corridor. Chopped to backward point
5.1,"Sam Curran to Williamson, no run","slower ball, good length on off stump. Defended off the back foot"
4.6,"Chahar to Williamson, 1 run",good length and coming into the corridor. Dabbed into the off side with soft hands off the front foot

4.1,"Chahar to Williamson, FOUR runs","short and just outside off, springs onto the back foot and gets nicely adjacent to this as he punches through cover"
3.6,"Sam Curran to Pandey, OUT","Bravo gets Pandey! Pandey gets Pandey first actually, with this call. Good length ball, sweetly punched on the rise to extra cover. An instinctive call for the run? There usually isn't a fielder that straight at cover in the powerplays. Inexplicable otherwise because it's traveling at a good speed to Bravo who picks up cleanly and gets in superb position to take down the stumps at the non-striker's end. He had run to his right too so he had all three stumps to aim at. A regular single to mid-off's left on most days"
3.5,"Sam Curran to Pandey, FOUR runs","slashed between cover point and short cover. They packed the infield but he finds a way. Short of a good length outside off, weight onto the front foot and slapped on the rise"
3.4,"Sam Curran to Pandey, no run","good length outside off, defended into the covers"
3.3,"Sam Curran to Warner, OUT",inside edge onto pad and Curran takes it! Full and into middle stump. Looks to swipe it behind point and gets it straight onto his front pad which was out in the leg side. Pings back up for Curran who has a short sprint to his left and an easy catch. That's the first time this season that Warner's fallen in the powerplay
3.2,"Sam Curran to Warner, no run",short of a good length and jumps up at him. Watchfully dropped into the off side off the back foot
3.1,"Sam Curran to Warner, 2 runs","good length outside off, punched off the front foot to sweeper's left"

2.4,"Chahar to Bairstow, 1 wide","slower short ball outside off, left alone"
2.3,"Chahar to Warner, 3 runs","miscued pull plops into the outfield past midwicket. Piyush Chawla has been midwicket to midwicket and he's being followed. Just has to retrieve this one though, it doesn't run away. Short ball at middle and got big on him"
2.2,"Chahar to Bairstow, 1 run","good length on leg stump, hangs back this time and clips to midwicket's right"
2.1,"Chahar to Bairstow, FOUR runs",dominant batting. Fourth ball off Chahar and the fourth time he's walked down at him. And this time he uses his wrists and whips this length ball from wide outside off in front of deep backward square
1.6,"Sam Curran to Bairstow, 1 run","good length on middle stump, nudged to midwicket's right from the crease"
1.5,"Sam Curran to Bairstow, FOUR runs",sweet sound off this. Good length and pushed across him. Reaches out with an angled bat and pats it firmly on the rise to beat extra cover to his left
1.4,"Sam Curran to Warner, 1 run",good length and cramped at leg stump. Pushed to midwicket's right
1.3,"Sam Curran to Warner, no run",good length and at the stumps. Defended down the pitch
1.2,"Sam Curran to Warner, no run","oh good shout for lbw. Turned down by the umpire, is Curran, and then by his captain who simply turns around. Good length at middle and leg. Looks for the flick and is pinned in front of leg stump. Was there an edge on that? Replays awaited. Yes there was"

0.6,"Chahar to Warner, 1 run","short of a length on the pads, clipped into the leg side off the back foot"

0.4,"Chahar to Bairstow, 1 wide","good length and down leg side, walks at it and can't get the flick going"
0.3,"Chahar to Warner, 1 run","short and wide outside off, a more confident shot this time. A cut to sweeper point"
0.2,"Chahar to Warner, no run","climbs past the edge. Short of a length outside off, checks his cut again and this one jumps up"
0.1,"Chahar to Warner, no run",just short of backward point. Good length inswinger wide outside off. Checks his poke at this and ends up lobbing it in front of that fielder
19.6,"Ahmed to Jadeja, 2 runs","full outside off, slogs across that and hits this into his partner's feet it appears. And that deflects towards long-off"
19.5,"Ahmed to Jadeja, FOUR runs","drilled to long-off's left. Overpitched ball outside off, gets down on a knee and clubs it firmly. A dive from the fielder will not allow him to get a hand on that"
19.4,"Ahmed to Jadeja, SIX runs","just over deep midwicket. Full toss at middle stump, slogged off the inside half of the bat but there's enough for it to clear the line"
19.3,"Ahmed to Chahar, 1 leg bye","slower ball, good length and at middle stump. Looks for the slog, cops it in the mid-riff"
19.2,"Ahmed to Chahar, 2 runs","full slower ball outside off, lofted to long-on's right. Warner slides as he stops this on the half-volley to his right. What an athlete, whew"
19.1,"Ahmed to Bravo, OUT","loses his stumps first ball. Overpitched ball angled away from leg stump stump. He's looking to launch it over long-on and is beaten on the outside edge. That was there for the hit and Khaleel's sheepish smile suggests he knows that. Just looked for the wrong part of the field, Bravo"
18.6,"Natarajan to Dhoni, OUT",taken at extra cover. Low full toss across the corridor. Gets low and wants to chip that over extra cover. It comes off the toe and hangs harmlessly for Williamson
18.5,"Natarajan to Dhoni, SIX runs","see ya! Vintage. Full and marginally short of yorker length at middle stump. Gets the front leg out of the way, hangs back on his back leg and whips it with those quick hands. 102 metres. Way, way over long-on"
18.4,"Natarajan to Jadeja, 1 run","dipping yorker at middle stump, flicked to deep midwicket's left off the toe-end"
18.3,"Natarajan to Dhoni, 1 run","wide yorker outside off, looks to drive through cover and gets it off the under-edge into the turf"

17.6,"Sandeep to Dhoni, 2 runs","full on leg stump, flicked to long-on's right"
17.5,"Sandeep to Dhoni, no run","oh nearly pulls off a blinder. Landed on his hip in the process and he's down trying to gather his breath. It was a good ball that Dhoni didn't pick at all, a legcutter. Good length and at middle. He was looking to punch to long-on and got a leading edge. Sandeep flew to his left and hung for a moment as he got his left hand on it. Just couldn't hold on"
17.4,"Sandeep to Jadeja, 1 run","slower ball, good length and across him. Can't beat point with the late cut this time"
17.3,"Sandeep to Jadeja, FOUR runs",caressed behind point. Short and wide and across him. Opens the face and bisects backward point and short third
17.2,"Sandeep to Dhoni, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to long-off"
17.1,"Sandeep to Jadeja, 1 run","good length on leg stump, whipped to fine leg's left off the back foot"
16.6,"Natarajan to Dhoni, no run",good length and wide outside off. Has a swish at that with static feet and is beaten
16.5,"Natarajan to Dhoni, FOUR runs","full toss wide outside off, allows that to go across him and slaps it to sweeper's right"
16.4,"Natarajan to Dhoni, FOUR runs","full toss at middle stump, it's a miscued pull off the high part of the bat. Backward square leg was a little too fine to get to that to his left"
16.3,"Natarajan to Jadeja, 1 run","good length and just outside off, dabs to third man's left off the back foot"
16.2,"Natarajan to Watson, OUT","another full toss taken at long-off. Slightly more complex, this take, but Pandey keeps his balance. Full toss wide outside off, spanked off the front foot and this dips to Pandey's left. Has a hurried sprint and then keeps his bearings after catching that"
16.1,"Natarajan to Dhoni, 1 run",good length and cutting in from middle stump as he looks to punch through cover with the angle. Thick edge towards square leg
15.6,"Ahmed to Dhoni, 1 run","slower ball, good length and just outside off. Nudged to extra cover's left off the back foot"
15.5,"Ahmed to Dhoni, no run",short and pushed across off stump. Leaves that alone hoping for the wide call on height. Not given
15.4,"Ahmed to Watson, 1 run","full and just outside off, mistimed drive to long-off"
15.3,"Ahmed to Dhoni, 1 run","good length at middle stump, deep in the crease and punches to long-on"
15.2,"Ahmed to Rayudu, OUT","straight to long-off. Friendly full toss wide outside off, about knee height. He hammers it to Warner's left and he crouches and takes that reverse cup"
15.1,"Ahmed to Rayudu, no run",yorker length and wide outside off Goes too far down leg side to make room and is beaten on the attempted slice
14.6,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","good length on leg stump, nudged into the vacant leg side"
14.5,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, SIX runs","smoked over deep midwicket! Full ball just outside off, gets low with the bat coming down from a third man direction. Then connects with perfect timing and nails the slog sweep"
14.4,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, no run","short of a length outside off, chopped to short third"
14.3,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, no run","good length at off, looks to glance, only manages to get it into the pitch"
14.2,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","good length at off stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
14.1,"Rashid Khan to Watson, SIX runs","straight over his head! Full and quick just outside off, half a step out and clean swing through the line. Rashid doesn't even bother to look"
13.6,"Natarajan to Watson, 1 run","yorker length outside off, sliced off the toe-end to sweeper cover"
13.5,"Natarajan to Rayudu, 1 leg bye","slower short ball at leg stump, shuffles and tries to guide that fine. Cops it on the body and is disgusted with himself. Short fine was in"
13.4,"Natarajan to Rayudu, FOUR runs",slashed over point. Full toss pushed across him and he lays back and has a swish under this
13.3,"Natarajan to Watson, 1 run","yorker at off stump, punched to long-off's right"
13.2,"Natarajan to Rayudu, 1 run","full and just outside off, steps out and drives to extra cover"

12.5,"Rashid Khan to Watson, no run","good length outside off, looks to flick and hits it straight onto the pad"
12.4,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","good length outside off, swept firmly to deep midwicket's right"
12.3,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, no run","beaten. Googly release, legbreak off the pitch. Outside off, plays for the one that comes in"
12.2,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","good length and into the pads, flicked to deep square"
12.1,"Rashid Khan to Watson, SIX runs",smoked over wide long-on with a slog sweep! Googly at a good length on off and middle. Quickly down on one knee and a clean swing in a straight-ish direction. He was bowled trying to hit a similar ball square in the last match. Nails this one
11.6,"Nadeem to Rayudu, SIX runs","lofted over the bowler. Good hit and once again, without reaching the pitch of the ball. This has only to do with the room and quick hands. Good length ball outside off beats him in flight but he's down leg side with enough swinging room. Angled bat swipe to launch it over the bowler"
11.5,"Nadeem to Watson, 1 run",Pandey takes it low at long-on and says he doesn't know if that's carried. Umpires send it up with the soft signal not out. Short of a good length and hurries him on middle. He pulls  in Pandey's direction and it's dying on him. He takes a few strides and in and grabs that. Third umpire says it's clear to him that the ball has hit the ground. It was a matter of one or two fingers that could have realistically been under the ball because he was diving towards the ground with his hands pointed downwards
11.4,"Nadeem to Rayudu, 1 run",good length and steps out to that. It's almost yorked him at leg stump. Jammed down to long-on
11.3,"Nadeem to Watson, 1 run",good length and slid into the corridor. Backs into the leg side to make room and punches to sweeper cover
11.2,"Nadeem to Watson, no run","good length and just outside off, punched to extra cover"

10.5,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","full on middle stump, jammed down to long-on"
10.4,"Rashid Khan to Watson, 1 run","full and just outside off, drilled firmly to Rashid's left. He's stuck his hand out and that has flicked his left ring finger it appears. And he's in pain"
10.3,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","good length and into the stumps, flicked to deep square's left"
10.2,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, no run","good length and spun away outside off, defended off the back foot"
10.1,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, no run","good length and spun into the stumps, pushed to extra cover off the back foot"

9.5,"Nadeem to Watson, 1 run",good length and into leg stump. Whipped to deep midwicket off the back foot
9.4,"Nadeem to Watson, 2 runs",short of a length and into middle stump. Mistimed pull to long-on's right
9.3,"Nadeem to Watson, no run",short and into the mid-riff as he looks to play the pull
9.2,"Nadeem to Watson, no run",good length and into leg stump. Looks to punch to long-on. Bowler cleans up to his right
9.1,"Nadeem to Rayudu, 1 run",short of a length and wide outside off. Steps out and isn't close to the pitch of this. Manages to slash this to sweeper's left
8.6,"Rashid Khan to Watson, no run","short of a length outside off, chopped to backward point"
8.5,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, 1 run","googly and in at leg stump, pulled to deep midwicket"

8.2,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, no run","good length and just outside off, punched back to the bowler"
8.1,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, no run",good length and spins away outside off. Hurriedly poked into the off side off the back foot
7.6,"Nadeem to Rayudu, 1 run","good length outside off, steps out and slaps it on the rise to sweeper's right"
7.5,"Nadeem to Watson, 1 run","good length arm ball at middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
7.4,"Nadeem to Rayudu, 1 run",good length and just outside off. Driven with the turn to long-off
7.3,"Nadeem to Watson, 1 run",good length and holding in the pitch outside off. Check-punch to sweeper cover
7.2,"Nadeem to Watson, FOUR runs","short and just outside off, quickly onto the back foot to punch this past extra cover"
7.1,"Nadeem to Rayudu, 1 run",sounds like a dropped catch and then overthrows. Short of good length ball sliding into the corridor. Late cut and a thick edge on it. Bairstow doesn't hold on and then he isn't alert to the throw from short fine. This trickles down to long-off
6.6,"Natarajan to Watson, no run","yorker at middle stump, squeezed onto his toe"
6.5,"Natarajan to Watson, no run","short of a good length outside off, mistimed chop to backward point"
6.4,"Natarajan to Watson, SIX runs","the trademark Watto pick-up. Full ball on the pads, a slower ball that doesn't quite grip. He has half a stride into the leg side and brings out that big flourish on the follow through as he lifts this over the backward square boundary"
6.3,"Natarajan to Rayudu, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to long-off on the up"
6.2,"Natarajan to Watson, 1 run","short of a good length, just outside off, chopped to third man"
6.1,"Natarajan to Watson, no run","good length and just outside off, tapped to mid-off on the back foot"
5.6,"Nadeem to Rayudu, FOUR runs","sliced over extra cover. Good length outside off, steps out and makes room but can't quite reach the pitch of it. Goes through with the shot anyway and clears the infield with ease"
5.5,"Nadeem to Rayudu, no run","full on off stump, steps out and drives inside-out to find extra cover"
5.4,"Nadeem to Rayudu, no run",good length and slight turn away in the corridor. Punches off the back foot and gets a thick outside edge to point

5.1,"Nadeem to Watson, no run","short and just outside off, punched to extra cover off the back foot"
4.6,"Sandeep to Rayudu, FOUR runs",lofted drive over the bowler. His go-to release shot that he kept missing as the bowlers bounced him last match. Good length ball this time and he runs down at it and pumps it
4.5,"Sandeep to Rayudu, no run","good length and swung in from outside off, defended into the off side"
4.4,"Sandeep to Sam Curran, OUT","knocked him over with a beauty. Curran had no clue against Sandeep tonight. Sandeep goes around the wicket, hits a good length with an angle into leg stump, but gets it to hold its line a touch. Curran nudges in front of the body for the angle and ends up playing inside that. It hits middle stump. But a job well done from CSK's new opener. Addendum: on second viewing, it looks like Curran just played the wrong line and it didn't straighten all that much. Also it hit leg stump"
4.3,"Sandeep to Watson, 1 run","good length on middle stump, flicked off the low part of the bat. To deep square's left"
4.2,"Sandeep to Watson, no run","good length and swung into off stump, defended solidly on the back foot"
4.1,"Sandeep to Watson, no run","good length and swung into off stump, defended off the back foot"
3.6,"Ahmed to Sam Curran, SIX runs","whack! No doubt about how well he's connected this. Slower ball, short and wide outside off. So much room. And he flat-blats it straight over the bowler"
3.5,"Ahmed to Watson, 1 leg bye",good length and swung into the pads as he looks to play the glance
3.4,"Ahmed to Sam Curran, 1 run","good length and into leg stump, a slower ball, flicked to midwicket"
3.3,"Ahmed to Sam Curran, SIX runs","short in the corridor and pulled again. Once again it doesn't look fully controlled, off the high part of the bat. He was cramped but did well to get the swing away. And there was more elevation in this. It's over the long-on boundary"
3.2,"Ahmed to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","short and climbing in the corridor, cramps him and he pulls again. Once again not off the middle, but this better hit than the previous one and is well over and wide of mid-on"
3.1,"Ahmed to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","gets one past mid-on. short and rising in the corridor. Looks to pull and gets this off the inside part of the bat too, but he's swung at it powerfully. Gets it to the fielder's right"
2.6,"Sandeep to Watson, no run","big lbw appeal is turned down and they won't review. That looked close, but possibly sliding down. Full and into the pads, falls over as he looks to flick"
2.5,"Sandeep to Sam Curran, 1 run",good length and across him in the corridor. Closes the face and drags this towards mid-on whose throw at the striker's end is too wide for Bairstow. Watson was struggling to get in
2.4,"Sandeep to Sam Curran, no run",good length and shaped away from off stump. Looks to poke into the off side with soft hands but extra cover onto it quickly
2.3,"Sandeep to Sam Curran, no run",good length and swung away from off stump. Driven on the rise to mid-off
2.2,"Sandeep to Watson, 1 run",short of a good length and swung into the corridor. Cut to third man
2.1,"Sandeep to du Plessis, OUT","got him! Faf waits ten minutes to have the strike and goes first ball. Looks like he expected that to come on much quicker. He's on the back foot and it's an inswinger from a good length outside off. He's on the way to middling this, to be fair, but because of his early timing he decides to check the shot. As a result, the bat hangs inside the line at the last moment and this flies off the outside edge"
1.6,"Ahmed to Sam Curran, 2 runs",dragged wide of mid-on. Good length and just outside off. Has a swipe across the line and gets it off the inside half of the bat
1.5,"Ahmed to Sam Curran, no run",short of a length and cramping him at middle and off. Forced to defend to backward point

1.3,"Ahmed to Sam Curran, no run","good length and just outside off, defended into the covers"
1.2,"Ahmed to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","slashed over point. They had a fielder back there last over, but not now. And he bowls short and wide. Curran chops at it without any intent to keep it down"
1.1,"Ahmed to Sam Curran, no run",short of a good length and rising in the corridor. Mistimed punch off the back foot
1.1,"Ahmed to Sam Curran, 1 wide","short and wide outside off, steps out at that but it is too far away"
0.6,"Sandeep to Sam Curran, 1 run","short of a good length and swung away, punched on the rise to sweeper"
0.5,"Sandeep to Sam Curran, no run",lovely delivery. Good length and hooping away after starting on leg stump. Curran offers the full face to defend and this is past the outside edge
0.4,"Sandeep to Sam Curran, no run",beaten on the cut. Short of a good length and swung away outside off
0.3,"Sandeep to Sam Curran, 2 runs",good length and swung away from outside leg stump. Allows that on and clips to deep square's right

17.6,"Saini to Varun, no run","Kohli dives to his left at short midwicket, but collects this on the half-volley. Or so it seemed originally. The umpires have gone upstairs, and their soft signal is out. It is not quite a half-volley, but the ball has touched the ground before Kohli completes the catch. That explains Kohli's unenthusiastic reaction. Not sure why the umpires went with a soft signal of out"

17.1,"Saini to Varun, no run","short of a length, quick, at him. Defended"
16.6,"Siraj to Tripathi, OUT","sensational catch by Morris. Tripathi gets no power in this pull, and Morris charges in from long-on. This has hardly gone past the 30-yard circle, but Morris makes the ground and dives to actually make it look relatively easy"

16.4,"Siraj to Tripathi, no run","slogs to leg, gets no power, takes a single to deep midwicket. No he turns down the single"

13.5,"Udana to Russell, OUT","Udana gets his own back. Game over. RCB are relieved although this didn't even get to threatening proportions, but they have been at the wrong end of this before. Udana goes full and wide, away from the wheelhouse, and all Russell manages is a catch to extra cover"

13.2,"Udana to Russell, SIX runs","Padikkal's special effort at wide long-on can't keep this in. Full and fast and wide, Russell mis-hits the slog, Padikkal gets to it, but can't drop it back in before touching the rope"

9.4,"Sundar to Karthik, 1 run","quick length ball, into the pads, worked away for one"
9.3,"Sundar to Morgan, OUT","Gill has run himself out. He has put himself under so much pressure he is trying to steal non-existent singles.

8.3,"Chahal to Morgan, 1 run","flat legbreak, turned to leg for one"
8.2,"Chahal to Morgan, no run","appeal for catch at the wicket, not given, and they review it. Morgan tries the reverse sweep first ball, the ball turns and bounces, and lobs off the forearm. No glove on the way. Now we will check for the lbw. It is hitting him in line but bouncing over"
8.1,"Chahal to Gill, 1 run","droped by Finch. Those big buckets have let this through. Gill comes down the pitch, gets too close to the pitch of the ball, and chips more that hits. Finch moves to his left at long-on, his natural side, but can't hold on"
7.6,"Sundar to Rana, OUT","and the slog-sweep gets him. He tries for the big six, and Sundar fires a quick length ball in. He is beaten, and his middle stumps is knocked back"

5.2,"Sundar to Gill, 1 run","offbreak that doesn't turn, and they steal a single off the outside half of the bat. Saini is the fielder at cover, and they have picked on him"
5.1,"Sundar to Rana, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to long-off for one"
4.6,"Siraj to Gill, SIX runs","cheeky. Siraj follows him with a short ball as he backs away, and he takes this from outside leg, and ramps this over short third. Actually this is not a ramp because he is not hitting this from down to up. He has has just cut this over short third. Flat six"
4.5,"Siraj to Gill, FOUR runs","nice shot. Stands his ground, gets this short ball, and elegantly pulls him over midwicket. No violence here"

4.3,"Siraj to Rana, no run","slightly fuller, tucked to leg again, but can't beat forward square leg this time"
4.2,"Siraj to Rana, FOUR runs","lovely shot first ball. Shot of a man in form. Short of a length, at the hips, he gets inside the line and tucks this away through square leg. Long leg has no chance"
4.1,"Siraj to Gill, 1 run","full ball at 135ks, Gill should ideally be timing this over mid-off, but this goes off the toe end to mid-off"
3.6,"Saini to Banton, OUT","unconvincing innings from Banton comes to an end. Tripathi must be wondering why he was dropped down the order. No risks taken. And he is bowled off the inside edge to a really quick delivery. At 148ks, short of a length, nipping in slightly, and Banton is done in"

2.4,"Siraj to Banton, no run",and now the quick bouncer at 143ks. Beats him hands down for pace as he hooks
2.3,"Siraj to Banton, no run","lovely delivery. Slower one, 121ks. It is the offcutter, Banton plays for that inward movement, but it holds its line and beats his outside edge"

2.1,"Siraj to Banton, 2 runs","wide full ball, driven in front of cover-point, but the dive there gets a touch on and saves two runs. Kohli is the fielder"

0.4,"Morris to Gill, no run","short of a length, on off, punched to cover-point"

19.3,"Russell to AB, (no ball) FOUR runs","of all th shots he has hit today, this is the most incredible. Russell has nailed a yorker outside off, but he has gone deep and across, and has managed to squeeze it over point for a perfectly timed shot. No-ball too"
19.2,"Russell to AB, no run","low full toss, nearly a yorker outside off, and de Villiers mis-hits it back to Russell"

17.4,"Russell to Kohli, 1 run",Kohli does well to hand it straight back to de Villiers as this yorker is good outside off and he digs it out to leg
17.4,"Russell to AB, 2 wide","slower short ball, outside off, left alone, wide. And Karthik concedes a bye as it bounces in front of him"
17.3,"Russell to AB, 2 runs","goes for the wide yorker, but gives him the low full toss. Mis-hit but over extra cover and between long-off and deep cover"
17.2,"Russell to AB, SIX runs","this is clean clean monstrous hitting. Russell gives him a length ball, and he makes room and unleashes a pure golf swing to send him back over his head. Not sure which part of Sharjah this ball has landed in. Fifty for AB"

15.6,"Nagarkoti, to AB, FOUR runs","looks for the quick yorker, 137ks, into the pads, but the length is slightly short of being a yorker. AB swings hard at it, and it runs off the inside half of the bat and past short fine leg"

12.5,"Prasidh to AB, FOUR runs","just de Villiers things. You think this should be four the moment it leaves his bat, but he has hit this straight into the stumps at the non-striker's end. But he has hit it so hard, that the ricochet beats mid-off and goes all the way to the fence for four"

10.3,"Varun to Kohli, no run","offbreak, and Kohli plays for the legcutter. Beaten on the inside edge. Kohli lets out a grunt for letting that happen"
10.2,"Varun to Kohli, 2 runs","legcutter, on a length, outside off, Kohli uses soft hands to place it into the off side and comes back for two"

9.2,"Nagarkoti, to Finch, 1 run","bouncer, Banton is wrongfooted at deep midwicket as this spins straight instead of square. He puts in the dive, though, to keep them down to one"
9.1,"Nagarkoti, to Kohli, 1 run",driven down to long-on for one
8.6,"Varun to Kohli, 1 run","flighted outside off, driven hard with his wrist unfurling on it, but Morgan makes a dive at cover and keeps them down to one. Seems he has saved at least one run here"

8.2,"Varun to Finch, no run",appeal for lbw as Finch doesn't pick this offbreak bowled with a legcutter action. Seems to be headed down. They don't review the not-out call

7.1,"Russell to Padikkal, SIX runs","and another chance goes begging. Russell has done Padikkal in with a slower ball, and two fielders converge towards the skier at long-off. And for a moment, both of them leave it to each other. Krishna makes a belated attempt to catch it. Doesn't even get a finger on it. Should have been a wicket. Is six"

6.5,"Varun to Finch, 1 run",Finch plays this flat delivery past short fine for one
6.4,"Varun to Finch, FOUR runs","another misfield. Varun ha bowled a good ball, short of a length, making him play to his field at deep midwicket, but Gill messes up a regulation take.

5.6,"Russell to Finch, FOUR runs","and the catching troubles continue for this IPL. An over ruined. Short ball, down the leg side, hit straight to short fine leg but Nagarkoti lets it slip through his fingers. What should have been a wicket becomes the only boundary for the over"

2.2,"Cummins to Padikkal, FOUR runs","these batsmen know they need runs here so they are not fooling around. Makes room, gets a length ball, and he goes inside-out over cover for four"

1.3,"Prasidh to Padikkal, 1 run",tucked away off the hip as Krishna stays short of a length
1.2,"Prasidh to Finch, 1 run",another walk down the wicket from Finch. He works this short-of-a-length delivery to long leg
1.1,"Prasidh to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length, at the pads, tucked away to long leg"
0.6,"Cummins to Finch, 2 runs","Finch keeps walking at him. Cummins bowls short of a length, and he tucks this away, in front of deep square, for a couple"
0.5,"Cummins to Finch, no run","quick bouncer, 142ks, Finch has walked enough at him. Cummins go upstairs, and makes him get out of harm's way"
0.4,"Cummins to Padikkal, 1 run","length ball, angling in, worked away to deep square for one"
0.3,"Cummins to Finch, 1 run",he is not letting Cummins beat him on the inside edge. Pushes this length ball to mid-off for one
0.2,"Cummins to Finch, FOUR runs","and Finch is covering that straight line really well. Walks a little at Cummins, and meets this straight length ball in front of the pad and clips him over midwicket"
0.1,"Cummins to Finch, no run",looks for the lbw ball that everyone bowls to Finch. But he is moving into the ball here and pushes this to mid-on
19.4,"Stoinis to Krunal, FOUR runs","short ball, he calmly pulls this over square leg and fine of deep square for four"
19.3,"Stoinis to Pollard, 1 run","short of a length, wide, punched wide of mid-off for one"
19.2,"Stoinis to Krunal, 1 run","Shaw exposed in the field again. This run is not on as Pandya dabs this towards point who is in tight. Imagine if Shaw picks this up and runs Pollard out, you have a new batsman on strike. But he doesn't pick this up clean"
19.1,"Stoinis to Krunal, FOUR runs",there is nothing golden about this. It is a plum little half-volley slower ball outside leg with fine leg in the circle. Pandya gathers four
18.6,"Nortje to Pollard, no run","he gets nothing. Quick length ball, Pollard is looking to play this down the ground, but gets an inside edge into the pad. No room here"

17.4,"Rabada to Krunal, no run","sharp short ball, at him, and he does well to drop his wrists and stays away from its line"
17.3,"Rabada to Ishan, OUT","another brace for Rabada. But is this too late? Kishan tries to end this right here right now, looking to upper-cut him, but Rabada gets big on him, making him loft this towards deep cover where Axar takes a smart low catch diving forward"
17.2,"Rabada to Ishan, SIX runs","he has picked not only the short boundary but also the shortest man on the field. Plays the pick-up shot to a short-of-a-length ball on the hip, and Shaw leaps at deep square and gets only finger tips to it"
17.1,"Rabada to Pollard, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, runs this down to third man"
16.6,"Nortje to Pollard, 1 run","short of a length, hit straight to mid-off, decides to take the quick single and makes it in what seems like 10 strides"
16.6,"Nortje to Pollard, 1 wide",full toss wide down the leg side. Pollard thinks he has missed out on a boundary
16.5,"Nortje to Pollard, FOUR runs",pulls this one from well outside off. He has picked the field again. No deep midwicket in place so he pulls this chest-high short ball in front of square
16.4,"Nortje to Pollard, no run","short of a length, at him, another dot as Pollard plays this back to him"
16.3,"Nortje to Pollard, no run","bouncer, in front of his face, outside off. Left alone"

16.1,"Nortje to Pollard, 1 run","yorker, dug out well to long-on"
15.6,"Stoinis to Ishan, FOUR runs","some shot. To get this much power off the back foot when hitting in front of square. Stoinis bowls short of a length, just outside off, and he crunches it in front of cover to find the gap at deep extra cover"
15.5,"Stoinis to Pollard, 1 run","on a length, outside off, pushed down the ground for a single to long-on"
15.4,"Stoinis to Ishan, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, pushed down the ground, only one pitch away from Stoinis, but he misfields to allow them a single"
15.3,"Stoinis to Pollard, 1 run","full, outside off, pushed to deep cover"
15.2,"Stoinis to Pandya, OUT","oh hello. It was a death wish all right but on Hardik's behalf. Rolls his fingers on a length ball outside off, Pandya swings hard for a six down the ground, but it takes the outside edge through to Carey. It is possible Pandya played for the offcutter but this one didn't quite grip"
15.1,"Stoinis to Pandya, no run","good start. On a length, just outside off. Defended"
14.6,"Rabada to Yadav, OUT","Rabada has his own back but is it too late? Yadav gets too ambitious. Shuffles across to try and take on the long-on, but Rabada's length is not full enough for that. The skier is taken at mid-off. He is gone but he has left them only a run a ball to get. That is better than batting deep and turning it into 13 an over"
14.5,"Rabada to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length, around off, steered to third man for one"
14.4,"Rabada to Yadav, 1 run",pushed just wide of point for one
14.3,"Rabada to Yadav, SIX runs","4, 2, 6 off Rabada. You better believe it. A dynamite innings. He picks on the short boundary. Gets inside the line, Rabada bowls into the hip, but he uses his wrists to whip this over long leg"
14.2,"Rabada to Yadav, 2 runs","he is taking Rabada on, making room and lofting him over mid-off. Not the cleanest of strikes but enough on it to clear mid-on"
14.1,"Rabada to Yadav, FOUR runs","legcutter slower ball, short of a length, wide, and he unfurls his wrists on the cut. Gets a thick edge, but it goes fine of third man for four"
13.6,"Stoinis to Ishan, FOUR runs","he brings out a ladder and reaches this wide short slower ball, and manages to cut it perfectly in the gap between short third and point. He will need some chalk after this"
13.5,"Stoinis to Yadav, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, punched to deep midwicket for one"
13.4,"Stoinis to Ishan, 1 run","low full toss outside off, pushed wide of mid-off for one"
13.3,"Stoinis to Ishan, SIX runs","Kishan announces himself here. Not allowing Stoinis bowl a cheap over. Lofts a length ball over long-on. Sweet connection, short boundary"
13.2,"Stoinis to Yadav, 1 run","wide length ball, pushed to mid-off for one"
13.1,"Stoinis to Ishan, 1 run","punched on the up, gets a single to mid-off"
12.6,"Axar Patel to Yadav, 2 runs",lovely chip over extra cover for another couple. Yadav looking in absolute control against spin
12.5,"Axar Patel to Ishan, 1 run","slow, on a length, and he punches this down to long-on"
12.4,"Axar Patel to Yadav, 1 run","arm ball, short of a length, punched to long-off"
12.3,"Axar Patel to Yadav, FOUR runs",and Yadav rubs it in by giving Shaw no chance here. He sweeps this one even harder and in front of square. Shaw has no chance here
12.2,"Axar Patel to Yadav, FOUR runs","fuller, slower, swept hard, and Shaw misfields at deep square leg. That's minus-three for him in the field"
12.1,"Axar Patel to Yadav, no run","flat, on a length, punched to extra cover"
11.6,"Ashwin to Yadav, 1 run","top edge on the sweep, but it falls well short of deep square leg"
11.5,"Ashwin to Ishan, 1 run","topsinner, on a length, straight, punched to wide long-on"
11.4,"Ashwin to Yadav, 1 run","offbreak, on a length, punched to deep midwicket for one"

11.2,"Ashwin to Yadav, 1 run","offbreak, pitched up, driven to long-on for one"
11.1,"Ashwin to Yadav, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Ashwin bowls the carrom ball, but it gives Yadav some width, and he punches this over extra cover for four"
10.6,"Rabada to Ishan, no run","short of a length, into the hip, and hits the hip. Another dot"
10.5,"Rabada to Ishan, no run","nothing slow about this. Bouncer at 140ks, and he is hooking as he is ducking. Beaten"
10.5,"Rabada to Ishan, 1 wide","short of a length, slower ball, and I hear a flick as it passes his hip. But it is called wide"
10.4,"Rabada to Yadav, 1 run",steered wide of point this time for a single
10.3,"Rabada to Yadav, no run","on a length, straight, pushed back to him"
10.2,"Rabada to Yadav, no run","wrong end from Iyer. Yadav drops this towards point, and refuses to respond to Kishan's call. Iyer hits the stumps direct but at the striker's end. That gives Kishan time to get back"
10.1,"Rabada to Yadav, no run","gets inside the line, and is beaten on the leg side. Good umpiring to not call it a wide even though he has missed the leg stump"
10.1,"Rabada to Yadav, 1 wide",looks to cramp him up with his angle but ends up sliding down the leg side
9.6,"Ashwin to Yadav, 1 run","carrom ball, middle and leg, driven to long-on for one"
9.5,"Ashwin to de Kock, OUT","Ashwin has got de Kock again. Lovely bowling again. The dip works even in T20. De Kock looks for the big sweep, but Ashwin gets the ball to drop out of his reach, and then his bounce does the rest to take the top edge for deep square leg to take. In a way that dropped catch last ball has netted the bigger fish. So catches don't always win matches. Time to go easy with that cliche"
9.4,"Ashwin to Yadav, 1 run","dropped by himself. Carrom ball, sits in the curface, hit off the toe end, back to him, he goes for the overhead catch and this just hits the fingertips and parries off"
9.3,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","on a length, pretty straight, worked to leg for one"
9.2,"Ashwin to Yadav, 1 run","offbreak, back of a length, punched down to long-on for one"
9.1,"Ashwin to Yadav, 2 runs","Yadav moves across early, Ashwin slows this down and goes straight, but he nails the sweep for a couple square of deep square leg"

8.5,"Patel to de Kock, 1 run","short of a length, tucked away off the hip"
8.4,"Patel to de Kock, FOUR runs","and he is picking his field now. Slower length ball, de Kocks gets inside the line and shovels this over short fine. De Kock brings up his fifty. Nobody has batted this fluently today"
8.3,"Patel to de Kock, FOUR runs","bouncer, quick, and de Kock loves the pace. Uses it to help it past short fine leg for four"
8.2,"Patel to Yadav, 1 run","slower offcutter, another forehand topspin from Yadav into the leg side. Just the single this time"
8.1,"Patel to de Kock, 1 run",looks to ramp an on-pace length ball over short fine. Gets an inside edge onto the pad
7.6,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, punched to deep midwicket for one"
7.5,"Ashwin to Yadav, 1 run",soft outside edge for a single straight of short third man
7.4,"Ashwin to Yadav, FOUR runs","this has topspun after pitching in the deep. Another whip to a length ball offbreak, it seems like deep midwicket has it covered to his left but the ball pitches and speeds off for four"
7.3,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","full outside off, driven hard to deep cover"
7.2,"Ashwin to de Kock, no run","slow offbreak, on off, defended back to him"

6.4,"Patel to Yadav, 1 run","slower ball, offcutter, pushed down to long-on for one"
6.3,"Patel to Yadav, FOUR runs","length ball, angling in, he gets inside the line and clips this through square leg and finds the gap perfectly"

6.1,"Patel to de Kock, no run","on-pace first up, on a length, 136ks, angled across him, beats him on the drive"
5.6,"Nortje to de Kock, 1 run","short of a length, tucked off the hip"
5.5,"Nortje to de Kock, SIX runs",top edge on the hook but not a smart ball with the fine leg up. De Kock knows this bouncer is too high to control but he also knows there is no one back to catch this. He gets six off the top edge
5.4,"Nortje to de Kock, no run","full, outside off, driven to extra cover"
5.3,"Nortje to de Kock, SIX runs","that's a shot and a half. This is a length ball pitched just outside leg, and de Kock picks it early to use his pace and play the pick-up over long leg"
5.2,"Nortje to de Kock, no run","on a length, middle and off, pushed back to him"
5.1,"Nortje to de Kock, no run","quick length ball, middle and leg, punched to mid-on"
4.6,"Axar Patel to Rohit Sharma, OUT","what an uncharacteristic shot from Rohit. He doesn't take risks this early, and de Kock is going well at the other end. So it is a surprise he slogs at this. Axar's pace is slow so he ends up dragging this to deep midwicket. He suggests he is trying to hit it straighter, but he is gone now"
4.5,"Axar Patel to Rohit Sharma, no run","on a length, sliding in with the arm. Defended back to him"
4.4,"Axar Patel to de Kock, 1 run","full, on the pads, pushed wide of mid-on for one"
4.3,"Axar Patel to de Kock, FOUR runs","quick length ball, angled into the pads, and he clears mid-on with this loft easily"
4.2,"Axar Patel to de Kock, 2 runs","reverse sweep, but Axar has slowed this down so he doesn't get much timing on it. Goes past point for two"
4.1,"Axar Patel to de Kock, no run","driven hard to the right of Axar, who gets a hand to this, but this isn't really a chance"
3.6,"Ashwin to de Kock, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to long-off for one"

3.4,"Ashwin to de Kock, no run","tries to go back and late-cut this length ball, but gets a bottom edge"
3.3,"Ashwin to de Kock, SIX runs","first boundary of the innings, and he makes it a big one. De Kock sees the ball is not turning so goes with the angle and lofts this length ball over mid-on"

0.4,"Rabada to de Kock, no run","wide length ball, driven hard, but straight to short extra cover"
0.3,"Rabada to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full, outside off, driven straight of mid-off, but the dive keeps them down to one"

19.5,"Bumrah to Carey, 2 runs","full toss, angling in, tucking hum up, hit straight of long-on for two"
19.4,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, 1 run","misses out. Full toss, on the pad. Just a touch too quick. Mis-hit to deep midwicket for one"
19.3,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","that will make Dhawan breathe slightly easier. Bumrah gives him the rare length ball, and Dhawan goes deep into the crease to loft him over midwicket"

19.1,"Bumrah to Carey, 1 run","full toss, angling in, cramps him up as he backs away. Just the single to long-off"
18.6,"Boult to S Dhawan, no run",pinpoint yorker to end the over. No room either. So he can't manoeuvre a single either
18.5,"Boult to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","finally a boundary for Dhawan. Boult misses the yorker by inches, bowling a half-volley on the toes, and Dhawan manages to beat deep square leg with this"
18.4,"Boult to Carey, 1 run",cramps him up with a shortish ball. Cut to deep point. This is excellent bowling
18.3,"Boult to S Dhawan, 1 run","nearly a yorker, just outside off, driven to long-off for one"
18.2,"Boult to Carey, 1 run","makes room to go into the short side, doesn't nail it, deep point keeps the ball in"
18.1,"Boult to S Dhawan, 1 run","slower short ball, makes him hit to the big side, just the single to deep midwicket"
17.6,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, driven hard but gets only a single to long-off"
17.5,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, no run","Dhawan backs away early, Bumrah slips in one full and wide. No chance to get close to it"

17.1,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, 1 run","Dhawan looks for the ramp over short fine, Bumrah bowls the slower one and also wide of off. He can't place it wide of the man. Just the single"
16.6,"Chahar to Carey, 2 runs","short of a length, around off, punched wide of deep midwicket for two"
16.5,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run",punched hard to extra cover for one
16.4,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 2 runs","tries the reverse sweep, gets a massive to edge, which clears the strong point field inside the circle"
16.3,"Chahar to Stoinis, 1 run, OUT","Stoinis runs on the misfield, and has been run out. Tries the big loft down the ground, goes off the inside half of the bat to long-on. Suryakumar Yadav gets a bad bounce and a wobble, Stoinis thinks that is enough for the second, but the thing is, the ball still rests with him and doesn't go too far. Which is probably why Dhawan doesn't come. And rightly so because Stoinis has taken just four steps, and still can't make it back in time"
16.2,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run",stays back to punch this shortish delivery to deep cover for one
16.1,"Chahar to Stoinis, 1 run","short, wide, cut away powerfully, but Rohit saves three runs with a dive at cover-point"

15.6,"Boult to Stoinis, 1 wide","slower short ball, angling in, but angling too far down leg"
15.5,"Boult to Stoinis, FOUR runs","what a player Stoinis is proving out to be for DC. This time he beats mid-off to his left. Boult misses the yorker length, Stoinis makes room and drives this between extra cover and mid-off"
15.4,"Boult to Stoinis, FOUR runs","picks his field. The mid-off is up so Stoinis is making room early and targetting that part of the field. Gets a short-of-a-length delivery, but he still powers it straight of mid-off for four"
15.3,"Boult to Stoinis, no run","bouncer, 133ks, over his left shoulder. Stoinis leaves this alone"
15.2,"Boult to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, on-pace, tucked off the hip for one to short fine leg. That brings up Dhawan's fifty"
15.1,"Boult to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","short of a length, on-pace, and Dhawan punches this past point. The sweeper, Chahar, is off the fence so he has to be perfect with his angles if he has to cut it off. He is not"
15.1,"Boult to S Dhawan, 1 wide","slower ball, short of a length, wide outside off. Called too"
14.6,"Krunal to Stoinis, no run","seems like the carrom ball, on a length, pretty accurate, hit back to Pandya"

14.4,"Krunal to Iyer, OUT","short of a length, quick, and Iyer finds deep midwicket who is a few yards off the fence. Seems slightly early into it. Off the toe end it goes"
14.3,"Krunal to S Dhawan, 1 run","only Pandya is appealing for the lbw here. Dhawan looks for the reverse lap here, and gets a bit of bat on this. Only a bit. So it is just the single"

13.5,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","short and straight this time, pulled to deep midwicket for one"
13.4,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length, wide. Dhawan misses out. Finds the man at extra cover. Six feet either side, and this would be four"

13.2,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","shorter, flatter, pulled for one off the bottom half of the bat"
13.1,"Chahar to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","first boundary off Chahar. He loks for a slow wrong'un, but pitches up a half-volley. So it doesn't matter which way it is turning. Dhawan has drilled this straight of long-off"

11.6,"Bumrah to Iyer, 1 run",soft hands again as Bumrah gives him neither the length to hit nor the room to swing. Another single to point

11.2,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, tucked away off the hip for one"
11.1,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, 2 runs","and nearly a wicket first ball. Seems lightly off pace, short of a length, and he makes room to cut, and it goes in the air and wide of point"

10.5,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run","on a length, no room, Iyer plays with soft hands and places this in front of point"

9.6,"Pattinson to Iyer, 2 runs","slower ball, short of a length, tucked off the hip, and they take two as this ball doesn't cross the 30-yard circle at backward square leg. Using the big side of the field for couples"

9.2,"Pattinson to Iyer, no run","on a length, closer to off, pushed to cover"
9.1,"Pattinson to Iyer, FOUR runs","but Iyer keeps attacking Pattinson. Not a horrible ball. Wide length ball, but this gives him the pace to time it with a square-drive. Places this to the left of point, and right of third man"
8.6,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 2 runs","wrong'un, too short, and Dhawan goes back to pull this wide of deep midwicket for two"
8.5,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, single to deep cover again"

7.6,"Pollard to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, slight more power in this dab so they will get just the one"
7.5,"Pollard to S Dhawan, 2 runs","slower ball outside off, Dhawan pushes this to the 30-yard circle at point, and calls two early, and makes it too. That is the big side of the ground"

7.3,"Pollard to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover"
7.2,"Pollard to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","slower ball again, shortish, widish, and Dhawan makes room to cut. Chahar at point is wrong-footed, and they get four"

6.6,"Krunal to S Dhawan, no run",slower through the air so Dhawan tries the paddle sweep but is still early into it. Hit on the back of the bat
6.5,"Krunal to Iyer, 1 run","soft hands, pushed for a single to cover"
6.4,"Krunal to Iyer, 2 runs","they convert zero into two. Iyer gets a bottom edge on the cut, and charges through for a quick single. Hardik Pandya from cover lets rip a wild throw, and they take the second"

5.5,"Pattinson to Iyer, 1 run","slower ball, down the leg side, Iyer wants four and not the wide. However, the change of pace means he doesn't get all of this. Just the single to square leg"
5.4,"Pattinson to Iyer, FOUR runs","not a bad ball this time, but Iyer shows great touch. Push-drives a wide length ball on the up, past the diving fielder at cover"
5.3,"Pattinson to Iyer, FOUR runs","length ball down the leg side, with fine leg up. Easy four. Pattinson having an off night here"
5.2,"Pattinson to S Dhawan, 1 run","down the wicket, drives a short-of-a-length ball to deep cover"
5.1,"Pattinson to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","short of a length, just outside off, but Dhawan opens the bat face really late to guide this between the keeper and short third man"
4.6,"Krunal to Iyer, no run",hits the pad again but this one is sliding down leg
4.5,"Krunal to S Dhawan, 1 run","Pandya shortens the length this time, and he pushes this towards cover for one"
4.4,"Krunal to S Dhawan, SIX runs","crunched away. Lovely sound. Out of the screws. Clears the front leg, and plays the big slog sweep over midwicket"
4.3,"Krunal to Iyer, 1 run","full, middle and leg, nudged to square leg for what looks like a risky single but Kishan fumbles to make it a comfortable one"
4.2,"Krunal to Rahane, OUT","lovely arm ball from Krunal. Given lbw, and Rahane refuses to review after Dhawan suggests this might perhaps be a touch high. Short of a length, angling in, Rahane looks to punch this to midwicket and misses completely. Hit in front of middle but high on the pad. Replays confirm the height was good"
4.1,"Krunal to S Dhawan, 1 run",plays the big sweep shot first up. Gets a single to deep square leg
3.6,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, 1 run","moves across, gets inside the line, clips this full toss into the leg side"
3.5,"Bumrah to S Dhawan, no run","excellent fielding by Ishan Kishan at cover-point. Dhawan thinks he has broken the shackles when he skips out of the crease, and punches this short ball square on the off side, but Kishan saves four runs with a dive on the edge of the circle"

2.6,"Boult to Rahane, no run","length ball outside off, pushed to cover-point"
2.5,"Boult to Rahane, FOUR runs","no slip there. After two tight-line deliveries, Boult goes full outside off, and Rahane gets a genuine edge on the drive. The slip would have gobbled this up, but MI have taken it out"

2.3,"Boult to Rahane, no run","quick bouncer, just outside off, pulled down to short midwicket"

1.6,"Pattinson to Rahane, no run","short of a length, just outside off, played with an open face to cover-point"

1.3,"Pattinson to Rahane, no run","short of a length, slight seam back in, cramping him up. Pushed to midwicket"

0.4,"Boult to Rahane, no run","swinging in towards off, Rahane lunges forward and defends"
0.3,"Boult to Shaw, OUT","he has chipped one to short cover. On a length, Shaw looks to push to cover, but the ball doesn't quite come on to the bat, and he ends up offering a catch to short cover. Plays in front of his body, and the bat face slices open in his hands. Big wicket. Early signs that the pitch might be slow"
0.2,"Boult to Shaw, FOUR runs","on a length, on off, angles away, Shaw pushes with soft hands, gets an outside edge and that goes between slip and short third man"
0.1,"Boult to Shaw, no run","full, slight shape back in towards off, defended"
19.5,"Ahmed to Parag, SIX runs","pumps it over the cover boundary and breaks into dance! It's a full toss outside off, he hangs leg side of it and hammers it inside-out. The win is sealed"
19.4,"Ahmed to Tewatia, 1 run","short of a good length just outside off, pulled off the front foot to long-on's left"
19.3,"Ahmed to Tewatia, 2 runs","good length, slower ball at off stump. Closes the face and picks this up to deep midwicket's left. Shankar had no real chance of stopping the second, and he fumbled it anyway running to his left."
19.2,"Ahmed to Parag, 1 run","low full toss outside off, hard hands again as he looks to drive through the off side. Inside edge down to long-on"
19.1,"Ahmed to Parag, 2 runs","dragged to long-off's right. Slower ball at a good length outside off, wants to lace that through the covers but is too eager. It's cue-ended over the bowler's head though and that gives them a second"
18.6,"Natarajan to Parag, 1 run","low full toss outside off, goes a little too hard with the attempted drive and ends up slicing with one hand off the bat to sweeper cover"
18.5,"Natarajan to Tewatia, 1 run","low full toss outside off, into the leg side again and slices to sweeper cover"
18.4,"Natarajan to Tewatia, SIX runs","and now he lifts one over fine leg! This is genius batting from Tewatia. He is playing SRH right now, just opening up whichever side of the field that he wants. It's going to be full from Natarajan, so there is an option to walk into the off side as well and that's what he goes with this time. Picks up this low full toss from middle and gets it a long way over that fielder in the deep"
18.3,"Natarajan to Tewatia, FOUR runs","gets it past mid-off! Low full toss at leg stump, backs a long way into the leg side and opens the face. Gets this off the low part of his bat but it bounces past Warner's dive to the right"

18.1,"Natarajan to Tewatia, 1 run","low full toss on middle stump, walks into the leg side and manages to only slice this towards sweeper cover"
17.6,"Rashid Khan to Tewatia, 1 leg bye","good length on leg stump, looks to flick and cops that on the pad. It's fine of short fine leg"
17.5,"Rashid Khan to Tewatia, no run","the luck's on his side as he survives both a catch behind and a stumping. Short of a length googly outside off, looks for the cut and runs straight away. Gets an outside edge that deflects off Bairstow's leg and onto the stumps. But the zing bails don't fall off"
17.4,"Rashid Khan to Tewatia, FOUR runs",now he goes over extra cover! He made them move sweeper cover to deep backward point and now he puts this full ball outside off right where that fielder might have stopped it. Just uses the angle. Remember how he struggled to get this exact angle away against Bishnoi in that famous match?  He's found a way
17.3,"Rashid Khan to Tewatia, FOUR runs","and again! Stunning attack from Tewatia. No playing Rashid out. This is a googly, good length and at middle stump. Switches again and lifts it past backward point"
17.2,"Rashid Khan to Tewatia, FOUR runs","whips it to the backward point boundary! He's switched his grip, and made full connection with this middle stump full toss to lift it over backward point"
17.1,"Rashid Khan to Parag, 1 run",good length and ripping away from off stump. Guides it to short third's left off the outside edge
16.6,"Sandeep to Parag, 1 run","short at middle stump, shuffles and tucks this through vacant square leg"
16.5,"Sandeep to Parag, FOUR runs","dinks it over the keeper! Superb execution. Parag has 14 off his last three balls and they're up to 17 this over. This is full ball at middle stump, he gets down into the off side, drops the shoulders and almost looks like he's yorked himelf. But somehow he manages to meet this on the half volley and steer it over YJB"
16.4,"Sandeep to Parag, FOUR runs","beats sweeper to the right. Slower short ball wide outside off, waits on it and chops it over extra cover. Rashid sprints to the right but his slide is not enough"
16.3,"Sandeep to Tewatia, 1 run",inside on the full toss and it's onto his pads. He's feeling sorry for himself for missing out even as Parag calls him through and sneaks a run pitch side
16.2,"Sandeep to Tewatia, 2 runs","overpitched outside off, drilled firmly past the non-striker and they steal a second to Warner's left at long-off"
16.1,"Sandeep to Tewatia, SIX runs","more sweet-sounding pulls! Dropped halfway down at middle stump, this knuckle ball. And just outside off. It's easier not to put this away. Tewatia onto the front foot and bludgeons this over wide long-on"
15.6,"Ahmed to Parag, SIX runs",oh that is massive! Slower short ball sitting up at middle stump and he pummels this pull shot off the front foot. It echos across the ground and slams into the flex banners in the first tier. 97 metres
15.5,"Ahmed to Parag, 2 runs","slower ball just outside off, pushed through the covers with an open face"
15.4,"Ahmed to Tewatia, 1 run","slower ball just outside off, closes the face and gets a leading edge through the covers"
15.3,"Ahmed to Parag, 1 run","dropped by deep midwicket. Well, technically it's not a drop if you don't even get a hand on it. Garg completely misses this after making the ground, to get under it. Slower short ball climbing up at middle stump, through the pull early and sliced. He just overruns this and can't get a hand with the reverse cup"
15.2,"Ahmed to Tewatia, 1 run","slammed past the bowler who couldn't get a hand on this catch attempt. Slower short ball outside off, flat-batted to long-off's left"

14.5,"Natarajan to Parag, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven to long-off"
14.4,"Natarajan to Tewatia, 1 run","run-out appeal on the non-striker's end as Natarajan dives for this in his follow through. He thinks he's got his little finger on this, on the left hand. At the moment of impact, Parag is about a foot outside the crease. Has he made it back before ball hits stumps? He was already reaching backwards as this straight drive off a full toss came back at the bowler.Doesn't matter because the third umpire can't conclusively say that touched Natarajan's finger. Good chance Parag was back in too. Yes he was"
14.3,"Natarajan to Parag, 1 run","low full toss just outside off, punched to long-off off the toe-end"
14.2,"Natarajan to Tewatia, 1 run","full and tailing into the pads, flicked to deep midwicket"

12.3,"Shankar to Tewatia, no run",just short of the bowler. Full and into off again. Aerial drive again as he checks this. Shankar dives forward in the follow through but it's died on him early
12.2,"Shankar to Tewatia, no run","full outside off, driven aerially towards mid-off"
12.1,"Shankar to Parag, 1 run","good length and onto the pads, flicked through square leg"
11.6,"Rashid Khan to Samson, OUT","thin edge taken well! Full outside off, a legbreak that he tries to drive through cover. Not close enough to it in the end and Bairstow does well with that. He's over the moon and so is Rashid"

11.3,"Rashid Khan to Samson, 3 leg byes","googly at a good length, down leg side, edge on the attempted flick. It's past the keeper and then Khaleel puts in a valiant sprint and reaches out to drag that in with his left arm. He's diving onto his right hip, but going at this leading with his left hand. He drags it in as his head is about to smash into the boundary padding, and then, somehow, manages to nutmeg himeself and keep that in as his left leg is lifted! Brilliant effort. He was running back from short fine and short third was around to pick up his flick"
11.2,"Rashid Khan to Samson, 2 runs","good length outside off, patted to sweeper's right off the back foot and takes on Shankar's arm to just make it in for the second"

9.6,"Rashid Khan to Parag, no run","another review sent up for lbw, this time by the bowling team. Googly hits him in front of leg as he gets forward to defend this.

9.1,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, OUT","trapped on the back foot and he reviews the lbw decision. Good length ball, seems like a conventional legbreak. But no, replays show that pitched on middle before sliding onwards to leg stump, where Uthappa is caught on the pad trying to play the glance as this keeps a touch low. It's three reds on DRS and he's gone straight after the break."
8.6,"Shankar to Samson, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, hangs back and chops that past point. Sweeper with no chance again"
8.5,"Shankar to Uthappa, 1 run","full at middle stump, driven aerially past the bowler, down to long-on"
8.4,"Shankar to Uthappa, 2 runs","good length on leg stump, shuffles and clips to deep midwicket's right with soft hands"
8.3,"Shankar to Samson, 1 run","good length just outside off, shuffles and punches to long-on"
8.2,"Shankar to Samson, 2 runs","good length outside off, driven sweetly on the up to sweeper's right"
8.1,"Shankar to Uthappa, 1 run","full slower ball on leg stump, leans in and clips to deep midwicket's left"
7.6,"Rashid Khan to Samson, no run","appeal for lbw again but this might be striking outside off and there's an inside edge on it. Good length outside off, a googly and he was looking to block on the front foot"
7.5,"Rashid Khan to Samson, 2 runs","tossed up outside off, drives neatly to sweeper's right"
7.4,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, 1 run","good length and just outside off, onto the back foot and flicks to deep midwicket"
7.3,"Rashid Khan to Samson, 1 run","full on leg stump, nudged to long-on"
7.2,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, 1 run","googly at a length on middle, leans in and taps it to long-on"
7.1,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, no run",lbw appeal turned down. Possible bat on that as Uthappa looks to whip a googly through midwicket. Spun in sharply and caught him in front of leg
6.6,"Abhishek to Uthappa, 1 run","good length on off stump, slides on. Punched to long-on off the back foot"
6.5,"Abhishek to Uthappa, no run","dropped short and down leg side, pulled to short fine"
6.4,"Abhishek to Samson, 1 run","full on off stump, driven to long-off"
6.3,"Abhishek to Samson, FOUR runs","wow, stunning. Short of a length at leg stump, walks into the leg side and shows all three stumps before punching this aerially to extra cover's left. Sweeper has no chance"
6.2,"Abhishek to Samson, FOUR runs",loose and put away. Short and into the pads. Swivels and places this pull to long leg's left
6.1,"Abhishek to Uthappa, 1 run","full and into leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
5.6,"Natarajan to Samson, no run","beaten and a maiden. Offcutter, good length and just outside off. Tentative drive at that as it cuts away from him"
5.5,"Natarajan to Samson, no run","full and at middle stump, nicely-timed drive, straight to mid-on"
5.4,"Natarajan to Samson, no run","slower ball, good length and ripping away from off stump. Nudged into the covers"
5.3,"Natarajan to Samson, no run","short at middle stump, shuffles and whips to midwicket's right. Rashid's dive means no single"
5.2,"Natarajan to Samson, no run","good length and just outside off, punched to mid-off's right"
5.1,"Natarajan to Samson, no run","short at leg stump, watchfully glanced to short fine"
4.6,"Ahmed to Uthappa, FOUR runs",top edge over the keeper. Is this the day he finds some luck? So far so good. He was outdone by this slower ball. Dug in short outside off and he wanted to pull. Had to check the shot in the end
4.5,"Ahmed to Uthappa, no run","full and just outside off, check-drive out to extra cover"
4.4,"Ahmed to Uthappa, SIX runs","launched over short fine. Poor bowling but that is sweetly put away. Fine leg is in and he goes short and down leg side. Uthappa just helps it with a pull, nails the timing"
4.3,"Ahmed to Uthappa, no run","slower ball, short and very wide outside off. Left alone"
4.2,"Ahmed to Uthappa, no run","short and rapidly across the corridor, 140.9kph. Sways away to let that go"
4.1,"Ahmed to Buttler, OUT","appeal for catch behind and given! Rajasthan are three down in the powerplay yet again.Good length and pushed across middle stump. He looks to close the face on that and turn it into the leg side. Gets an inside edge onto thigh and it dies on Bairstow, who does well to scoop it up"
3.6,"Natarajan to Buttler, 1 run","length outside off, punched towards mid-off"
3.5,"Natarajan to Buttler, no run",
3.4,"Natarajan to Buttler, 1 run, OUT","looks like they have Smith at the non-striker's end. Yup, by a long long way. It's a slower short ball pulled to deep square and they've come back for a second that Smith can't make even with a big, desperate dive. Natarajan picks the one-bounce throw and lobs it onto the stumps. Smith doesn't wait for the third umpire's decision.Smith was hesitant. It was Buttler's call. Paradoxically, it was Smith who ran the first one hard and got there before Buttler got to the other end. Just a slight pause as Buttler hared back for the second - and he looked like he would have completed it. But Shankar, running to his left, put in the perfect throw"
3.3,"Natarajan to Buttler, SIX runs",over the line in a second! Wow. Short at the hips and it's a short-arm pull that is timed so perfectly that it's gone about waist height before dipping over the backward square boundary
3.2,"Natarajan to Buttler, FOUR runs","smoked. Short ball is a bit too short. Doesn't get steep, sits up instead and Buttler nails that pull well in front of square"
3.1,"Natarajan to Buttler, no run","yorker at middle stump, squeezed towards mid-off"
2.6,"Sandeep to Buttler, 1 run","slower length ball on middle stump, punched to long-on"

2.1,"Sandeep to Smith, no run","good length and swung in at off stump, tapped to midwicket off the back foot"
1.6,"Ahmed to Buttler, no run","good length and just outside off, shoveled with the angle to backward point's left and Pandey tumbles to stop the run"
1.5,"Ahmed to Smith, 3 runs",good length on middle stump and neatly tucked through midwicket. Shuffles onto the back foot and uses the pace to work this to deep square's left
1.4,"Ahmed to Smith, no run","full outside off, 140.5kph, drives firmly to extra cover"
1.3,"Ahmed to Smith, no run","short and just outside off, 137kph, punched into the covers"
1.2,"Ahmed to Stokes, OUT","played on! There's more evidence of a slow pitch. It's a short ball climbing away outside off. He shuffles and wants to pull through midwicket but it's off the inside edge and onto leg stump. Khaleel is overjoyed, and who wouldn't be with this wicket? Yet another opening combo fails for RR, four times in a row now"
1.1,"Ahmed to Buttler, 1 run","short at middle stump, punched to midwicket's right"
0.6,"Sandeep to Buttler, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to mid-off's left"
0.5,"Sandeep to Stokes, 1 run","short of a length and across him outside off, whips to mid-on's left"
0.4,"Sandeep to Stokes, no run",short of a length and swung away outside off. Mistimed cut to cover
0.3,"Sandeep to Stokes, FOUR runs",whack. First runs for Stokes in IPL 2020. And it is a trademark punch past the bowlers. Steps out at this outswinger to cut out the angle and pumps it on the rise between Sandeep and mid-on
0.2,"Sandeep to Stokes, no run","beaten. Good length and skidding low outside off, swung away. Beaten on the chop"
0.1,"Sandeep to Stokes, no run","good length outswinger from off stump, walks down the pitch and defends down the pitch"
19.6,"Unadkat to Garg, 1 run, OUT","full slower ball wide outside off, reaches out and lofts to long-off's left. Jofra picks up on the bounce and then sends a vicious throw to the striker's end on the bounce. Garg has no chance of making it"
19.5,"Unadkat to Garg, FOUR runs","waits on that and lofts it nicely over short fine. Slower short ball. Shapes for the hook and then waits a long time on it to deliberately lift that in that direction. Wasn't looking to hit that hard, and didn't need to"
19.4,"Unadkat to Williamson, 1 run",slower short ball just outside off. Steps out and tries to make room for the cut. Gets an inside edge to short fine
19.4,"Unadkat to Williamson, 1 wide","good length slower ball wide outside off, neaten on the attempted reverse sweep"
19.3,"Unadkat to Williamson, 2 runs","overthrows at midwicket again. Slower ball, short of a good length outside off. Punched on the bounce to Stokes who wants to get KW at the non-striker's. Would have too if he'd gotten a direct hit, but instead Smith has to clean up at deep midwicket and his return throw slips and there's a brief thought about a third run at mid-on before Unadkat sprints after it"
19.2,"Unadkat to Garg, 1 run",good length slower ball pushed wide outside off. Sliced towards sweeper cover
19.1,"Unadkat to Garg, SIX runs","swept over deep midwicket! Slower ball at a good length outside, just hangs on a touch to wait on it and then gets the perfect timing on it. That is difficult on this pitch. Sweet hit"
18.6,"Archer to Williamson, SIX runs",quality. Williamson gets two sixes to close off Archer's spell. This one is classic KW. Short at the hips and he swivels perfectly to get in position and helps this over long leg
18.5,"Archer to Williamson, 2 runs","low full toss on middle stump, shuffles and flicks to deep square's left"
18.4,"Archer to Garg, 1 run",short and cramping him at the waist. Pulls from under it and it's well short of deep square
18.3,"Archer to Garg, 2 runs",just evades extra cover. Stokes diving backwards and to his left. It's a high-ish full toss outside off and he slices that
18.2,"Archer to Garg, no run",bowled him with a legcutter. Full and smashes leg stump and deflects to short third. Garg takes off for the run but is sent back. He was looking slog that
18.2,"Archer to Williamson, (no ball) 1 run",high full toss above the waist. Mistimed pull towards fine leg
18.1,"Archer to Williamson, SIX runs","casually lofts a Jofra slower ball, one-handed, to long-on's left. This, of course, is what Williamson is known for - the walk into the leg side and desperate swishing to try and reach the ball. 94 metres!"
17.6,"Unadkat to Garg, no run","slower ball, short and cutting away from the corridor. Looks to turn it into the leg side but can't get it off the pitch"
17.5,"Unadkat to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball, short and outside off. Cut to sweeper cover"
17.4,"Unadkat to Pandey, OUT",holes out to long-on. It was coming. This is extremely savvy from Unadkat. It's near impossible to hit slower short balls into the leg side today. He gets this to sit up at chest height and has him slicing. A simple catch well inside the boundary from long-on
17.3,"Unadkat to Pandey, 2 runs","slower short ball at leg stump. Another laboured pull, this time to deep midwicket's left on that big boundary"
17.2,"Unadkat to Pandey, 2 runs","digs it in, short and turning away outside off. Steps out and hoicks off the inside edge to get this to deep midwicket's right"
17.1,"Unadkat to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball, short of a good length outside off. He shapes for the ramp but is forced to adjust and push this to short third"
16.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, no run","short outside off, and a bit too high as he looks to pull from under this"
16.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Williamson, 1 run","short and up at middle stump, aerial pull to deep midwicket's right"
16.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, 1 run",brings up fifty from 40 balls. It's a full toss onto his pads and he can't get the swish away to Archer's left at fine leg
16.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, FOUR runs",nicely placed. Delivered looking for the blockhole on the the leg side but Pandey takes a step down and makes this a hittable full stop. Deliberately checks his flick to place it between deep square and deep midwicket
16.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Williamson, 1 run","low full toss on off stump, shuffles and flicks to long-on"
16.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, 1 run",and there's his famed yorker first up. Nails it at a leg stump line. Pandey awkwardly gets both legs into the leg side and does okay to squeeze this behind square
15.6,"Tewatia to Pandey, 1 run","full and wide outside off, extends the arms and drives to long-off's left"
15.5,"Tewatia to Pandey, 2 runs",good length and angled into him. Steps out and clips through square leg
15.4,"Tewatia to Pandey, SIX runs","oh this is smoked. Pushed through a bit quicker and that helps as Pandey runs down to the pitch of this length ball and smokes it 94 metres, into the second tier over long-on"
15.3,"Tewatia to Pandey, no run","short and wide outside off, cut to cover"
15.2,"Tewatia to Pandey, no run","short outside off, steps out and flicks it right onto his boot"
15.1,"Tewatia to Pandey, FOUR runs","Tyagi comes in and this clears him at deep midwicket. Short ball really dug in. Pandey steps out and puts his entire upper body into this pull shot, back leg lifted and all. Tyagi is already in from the rope on the big side, but he takes a few more steps in and that costs him"
14.6,"Archer to Williamson, no run",short and in the corridor. Leaps to try and get on top of that. It's at 148kph. His attempted glide to third man can't beat Buttler to his right
14.5,"Archer to Williamson, no run","bouncer rising sharply in the corridor, left alone"
14.4,"Archer to Warner, OUT","splits middle and leg! Superb. Didn't get him early on but gets him anyway. Around the wicket, full and and fast and angled in at leg stump. Warner walks into the leg side and makes room to drive through cover. Misses it entirely"
14.3,"Archer to Warner, 2 runs","yorker at middle stump, 145.5kph. Squeezed to extra cover's left. Samson swoops down at it and makes Warner scramble at the non-striker's end. Might have just made it even if there was a direct hit. Earns an overthrow at midwicket for his efforts"
14.2,"Archer to Warner, no run",full and curves into the corridor at 145kph. Warner beaten on the inside edge as he looks to loft in long-on's direction
14.1,"Archer to Pandey, 1 run","good length legcutter at middle, driven to long-on"
13.6,"Gopal to Warner, 2 runs",good length and pushed through outside off with the front of his hand. Slapped on the rise between bowler and stumps. Long-off does well to tumble to his left and stop. Parag the fielder
13.5,"Gopal to Warner, no run",full and front-of-the hand outside off. Warner steps into the off side and is beaten on the sweep
13.4,"Gopal to Pandey, 1 run","front of the hand short ball outside off, punched to deep extra cover"
13.3,"Gopal to Pandey, SIX runs","just clears long-on. Good length at off stump, steps out to get to the pitch and then a laboured drag with a closed face. There's enough on it"
13.2,"Gopal to Pandey, no run",short and spinning away outside off. Under-edge as he goes too hard on the cut
13.1,"Gopal to Warner, 1 run","short and dug into the pitch, wide outside off. Makes him reach out and club that on the bounce to long-off"
12.6,"Unadkat to Warner, 1 run","slower short ball outside off. Looks for the pull, ends up slicing to long-on's left. He pulls out to collect it on the bounce and gets one or two shouts from the field. Shreyas Gopal"
12.5,"Unadkat to Pandey, 1 run","slower short ball from over the wicket, pulled to deep midwicket"
12.4,"Unadkat to Warner, 1 run","low full toss at middle stump, mistimed slog to deep midwicket"
12.3,"Unadkat to Pandey, 1 run","nice connection on this slog, but it's on the bounce to deep midwicket. Good length and a cutter outside off. That's about the best you'll get with a slog on this pitch against a slower ball"
12.2,"Unadkat to Warner, 1 run","slower ball, dug in short of a good length. Dragged with a front foot pull to deep midwicket"
12.1,"Unadkat to Pandey, 1 run",good length and into the corridor. Forward stride as he pushes to long-on
11.6,"Tewatia to Pandey, 1 run","full on off stump, driven to long-off"
11.5,"Tewatia to Warner, 1 run",drops short of short fine leg. Tewatia goes around the wicket and bowls full at leg stump. It's there for the conventional slog but Warner was looking for the switch hit. Leading edge is well short of the fielder
11.4,"Tewatia to Pandey, 1 run","full on off stump, driven to long-off"
11.3,"Tewatia to Pandey, no run","full on off stump, driven to extra cover"
11.2,"Tewatia to Pandey, no run",good length and sliding in at middle stump. Defended to extra cover
11.1,"Tewatia to Pandey, no run",good length and sliding into leg stump. Driven to midwicket's left
10.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, 1 run","short outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
10.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, no run",short and up at middle stump. Backs into the leg side to try and open up the off. But that's so slow onto him that he can only forehand that to mid-off
10.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Warner, 1 run","short and down leg side, gets up and hooks that towards fine leg"
10.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Warner, 2 runs","short at middle stump, pulled between deep square and fine leg"
10.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Warner, SIX runs","spanked over mid-off. Short ball takes an eternity to lift up outside off. He waits on that crunches it. Mid-off is in the circle. He had to use his own power for that, got nothing off the surface"
10.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandey, 1 run","good length and wide outside off, clears the front leg and looks to slap through cover on the up. Gets an under-edge into the turf and it's a good stop to the right from Buttler, diving to his right"
9.6,"Tewatia to Warner, 2 runs","short and wide outside off, allows that to come on and cuts late to place this to sweeper's right"
9.5,"Tewatia to Pandey, 1 run","good length and in at middle, punched to long-on off the back foot"
9.4,"Tewatia to Warner, 1 run","good length and pushed across him outside off, Dragged aerially to deep midwicket's right"
9.3,"Tewatia to Pandey, 1 run","good length and sliding into middle stump, punched to long-on with the angle"
9.2,"Tewatia to Warner, 1 run","short and wide outside off, going away from him. No power on this pull to long-on"
9.1,"Tewatia to Pandey, 1 run",good length and turning away outside off. Punched to long-on with a closed face
8.6,"Stokes to Warner, FOUR runs",swatted over wide mid-off! Short ball hits up nicely and it's put away firmly with a flat bat
8.5,"Stokes to Warner, no run","short and down leg side, left alone"
8.4,"Stokes to Pandey, 1 run","short at off stump, pulled off the front foot deep square's left"
8.3,"Stokes to Warner, 1 run","short at middle stump, pulled to deep square"
8.2,"Stokes to Warner, no run","full and just outside off, driven along the floor to mid-off"
8.1,"Stokes to Pandey, 1 run",good length and in at leg stump. Clipped to deep square's right
7.6,"Gopal to Warner, 2 runs","googly, short outside off. Onto the back foot to punch to long-off's right"
7.5,"Gopal to Pandey, 1 run","googly, short and turning into off stump. Punched to sweeper's right"
7.4,"Gopal to Warner, 1 run","front of the hand again, good length at leg stump. Punched to long-on's left"
7.3,"Gopal to Warner, SIX runs",slogged over wide long-on. Nice pace on this front-of-the-hand quicker one that's full at leg stump. Front leg out of the way and boom
7.2,"Gopal to Pandey, 1 run","converntional legbreak, short of a good length and turning away from off. Onto the back foot to punch to sweeper"
7.1,"Gopal to Pandey, no run","good length, front of the hand legcutter? Just outside off and pushed to extra cover"
6.6,"Tewatia to Warner, no run","checks the shot again. A googly sits in the pitch outside off and he pushes it aerially, but safely, back to the bowler"
6.5,"Tewatia to Warner, FOUR runs",swiped past short third. Set up for the switch hit and this was short enough that he could wait outside off and get it fine of that fielder off the back foot
6.4,"Tewatia to Pandey, 1 run","full and slanted into off stump, opens the face and drives that down to long-off"
6.3,"Tewatia to Pandey, no run","good length and in at middle, pushed to midwicket off the back foot"
6.2,"Tewatia to Pandey, SIX runs","lofts that straight. One of his go-to shots when spinners attack his stumps and he's good at it. Right to the pitch, a clean swing to send that 89 metres"
6.1,"Tewatia to Pandey, no run",good length and slanted into leg stump. Defended to midwicket
6.1,"Tewatia to Pandey, 1 wide","good length and down leg side, left alone"
5.6,"Unadkat to Warner, no run",well bowled. Outfoxed Warner there who was set to loft that straight. Had to check it and pat this good length ball back to the bowler
5.5,"Unadkat to Pandey, 1 run",offcutter at a good length on middle. Walks into that as he flicks to midwicket
5.4,"Unadkat to Warner, 1 run",good length and angled into him. Might have been an offcutter too. Pushed into vacant midwicket
5.3,"Unadkat to Pandey, 1 run","half-stop at mid-on. Good length ball across him, whips it to Jofra's left, against the angle"
5.2,"Unadkat to Pandey, no run",short and across off stump. Steps out and runs into the line of this one. Cramped and pokes into midwicket

4.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Warner, no run","short and across him outside off, flat-batted drive on the up, straight to mid-off"
4.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Warner, no run","bouncer at a leg stump line, left alone"
4.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Bairstow, OUT","lovely catch to the left at deep square. Tyagi gets this one higher and Bairstow is done by the pull shot! It's up at the throat this time, angled in from outside off. He's pulling off the front foot again gets it high on the bat. Samson tracks it nicely to the left before diving to hold on with a soft landing"
4.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Bairstow, SIX runs","whipped over square leg now. Don't feed Bairstow there! Tyagi likes bowling wide of the crease and the first three balls have been a perfect release for Bairstow. This one is the best of them all, because it's close to his body. He's on the front foot for the short-arm pull"
4.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Bairstow, 2 runs","short of a length and wide outside off again, 137.5kph. Swipes it behind the deep square fielder off the inside half"
4.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Bairstow, 2 runs","wide of the crease, short of a good length and wide outside off. Flat-batted slash at that ends up to deep square's left off the thick inside edge"
3.6,"Gopal to Warner, no run",googly and cramped again at middle stump. Mistimed back foot punch trickles into the covers
3.5,"Gopal to Bairstow, 1 run",good length and turning into middle. Whipped to long-on off the back foot
3.4,"Gopal to Bairstow, no run",good bowling. Bairstow was on a middle and off stump guard with leg stump visible. Looking to open up the leg side. He bowls a googly at cutting length and cramps him anyway. He can only find point
3.3,"Gopal to Warner, 1 run",good length and skidding through outside off. Punched to mid-off's right
3.2,"Gopal to Warner, FOUR runs","checks the lofted sweep but it's good enough. Googly at middle stump, going away from a good length. Just drags it over midwicket"
3.1,"Gopal to Bairstow, 1 run",good length and just outside off. Steps out and has a swing through the line but he isn't to the pitch of this. It's dragged to long-on's left
2.6,"Archer to Bairstow, 1 run",a misfield at midwicket means no maiden for Archer. Slower length ball harmlessly pushed to the midwicket fielder off the front foot. Tewatia runs past it
2.5,"Archer to Bairstow, no run","good length and in at middle stump, watchfully nudged to midwicket. 150.1kph that one"
2.4,"Archer to Bairstow, no run",forced to evade that. 145kph bouncer lifting up at his face. Was halfway into a hook before that rose up and he got out of the way
2.3,"Archer to Bairstow, no run","short and 148kph, climbing up outside off. Watchful punch to cover point"
2.2,"Archer to Bairstow, no run","short of a length outside off, 142.7kph, hurried punch into the covers"
2.1,"Archer to Bairstow, no run","good length and just outside off, patted into the covers off the back foot"

1.2,"Gopal to Bairstow, 1 run","good length outside off, jabs to point off the front foot"
1.1,"Gopal to Bairstow, no run","googly, short of a good length outside off. Onto the back foot and punches to cover point"
0.6,"Archer to Warner, no run",mean bouncer has him ducking. 145kph and angled at the helmet. Under that quickly and then seeks a wide from the square leg umpire. It is not forthcoming
0.5,"Archer to Bairstow, 1 run","short at leg stump, allows it to come on and nudges to deep square off the back foot"
0.4,"Archer to Warner, 1 run","good length and just outside off, pushes towards mid-off with soft hands"

0.2,"Archer to Warner, no run","good length and just outside off, defended off the back foot"
0.1,"Archer to Warner, no run","misses a full toss. Just outside off and he simply misses the drive. Oh correction, Ultra Edge says there was a nick on it but it bounced before going through to the keeper"
19.6,"Udana to Thakur, 1 run","yorker and just outside off, jammed down to long-on"
19.5,"Udana to Chahar, 1 run","full slower ball wide outside off, shuffles and skews the attempted slog into the off side"

19.1,"Udana to Chahar, 2 runs","full at middle stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
18.6,"Morris to Jadeja, OUT","taken at deep midwicket. Full toss on leg stump, a hurried flick and hardly a step needed to be taken, it's straight into that fielder's grasp"
18.5,"Morris to Jadeja, FOUR runs",short and at the hips. Springs onto the back foot and pulls this past square leg
18.4,"Morris to Bravo, OUT","takes it this time! A full toss outside off, Bravo looking to loft that over long-off but the bat turns and he miscues that. Padikkal with a similar sprint in and this time he's got his hands in position to grab it at waist height"
18.3,"Morris to Bravo, 2 runs","dropped. At long-off by Padikkal, running in. Short and wide outside off, Bravo gets too far leg side and has a swish from under it. Padikkal makes the ground bit loses balance right at the end and cops that on the thigh"
18.2,"Morris to Bravo, 2 runs","yorker at middle stump, shuffles and just manages to squeeze this into the midwicket region"
18.1,"Morris to Jadeja, 1 run","yorker wide outside off, chopped to deep backward point"
17.6,"Udana to Jadeja, 1 run",full and dipping in to the corridor. Mistimed drive in long-on's direction
17.5,"Udana to Bravo, 1 run","slower good length ball at middle stump, mistimed slog to deep midwicket"
17.4,"Udana to Bravo, 2 runs","full and just outside off, stands tall and whips this off the back foot to long-off's left. All hands, that shot"
17.3,"Udana to Rayudu, OUT","knocks middle stump and points to his captain at long-on. It's a loopy, slow full toss on off stump. He's in the off side looking for the paddle sweep. Paddles it onto middle stump. A laboured innings that never looked like taking off. Rayudu's struggle ends"
17.2,"Udana to Rayudu, 2 runs","full and wide outside off, steps out but that keeps dipping away from him. Reaches out and chips that over extra cover"
17.1,"Udana to Rayudu, 2 runs","full slower ball, wide outside off. Sliced to sweeper's left"
16.6,"Morris to Rayudu, 1 run","low full toss outside off, swept to deep square"
16.5,"Morris to Rayudu, no run","full and at off stump, makes room and drives straight to extra cover"
16.4,"Morris to Jadeja, 1 run","good length at middle stump, backs away and mistimes the loft to extra cover's right"
16.3,"Morris to Jadeja, no run","short and wide outside off, cut to backward point"
16.2,"Morris to Sam Curran, OUT",there's a sound on it and bowler and keeper are convinced. They convince Kohli to review the catch behind appeal. It's a short ball at middle. Curran is backing into the off side for the ramp and there's a sound as ball passes glove and sails over the stumps. Early visions of the replay show this is a good review .And Ultra Edge confirms there's an edge on that.
16.1,"Morris to Rayudu, 1 run","full and in at off stump, plants the front leg across and whips it straight to short fine"
15.6,"Chahal to Dhoni, OUT","taken at long-off! Calculative and consistent. Chahal's had a bad night tonight but with his last ball he's got Dhoni hitting exactly where he wants. This is tossed up full and wide outside off. Dhoni has to reach out a long way. He does and he gets a hammer down on the ball. But from his position, nearly split across the crease, he can't get elevation. It's right into the hands"
15.5,"Chahal to Dhoni, no run","good length, loopy at 78kph on a leg stump line. Looks for the slog sweep, but that turns away and gets him on the body"
15.4,"Chahal to Dhoni, 2 runs","full on leg stump, flicked aerially to deep midwicket"
15.3,"Chahal to Dhoni, SIX runs","clears long-on with ease. Chahal lobs this right in Dhoni's hitting arc at leg stump. He shuffles his feet and gets entangled somewhat, but has managed to keep his balance and drill this flat"
15.2,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run","good length at middle, steps out and drives aerially to long-on's left. Kohli swoops in and picks up on the bounce"
15.1,"Chahal to Dhoni, 1 run",good length and sliding on at off stump. Punched to deep extra cover
14.6,"Saini to Dhoni, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to sweeper cover off the back foot"
14.5,"Saini to Rayudu, 1 run","yorker at leg stump, jammed down to long-on"
14.4,"Saini to Rayudu, no run","short and rising outside off, steps out and has a waft. Beaten"
14.4,"Saini to Rayudu, 1 wide","beaten. And perhaps a harsh wide ball. Slower short ball, just around the tramline. Rayudu has made too much room for the cut"
14.3,"Saini to Rayudu, FOUR runs","carted away. Full ball outside off, steps into line and slogs and ugly slog well in front of square. Midwicket was in the circle"
14.2,"Saini to Jagadeesan, OUT","oh that's a meek end. Low full toss on off stump, mistimed punch to mid-off's left and he takes off for a run he's no even determined to finish. Sort of gives up and hopes at the end while Morris picks up and hits the stumps direct at the non-striker's"
14.1,"Saini to Jagadeesan, no run",short and jags in off the seam outside off to beat his attempted late cut
13.6,"Dubey to Jagadeesan, 1 run","short and in at the stumps, backs away and punches to sweeper"
13.6,"Dubey to Jagadeesan, 1 wide",full and down leg side. Was played by the batsman's early shuffle into the leg side
13.5,"Dubey to Jagadeesan, 2 runs","full outside off, jumps into the off side to get in line and whip this to long-on's right"
13.4,"Dubey to Rayudu, 1 run","short and just outside off, steps out and slices a pull feebly down to long-on"
13.3,"Dubey to Rayudu, FOUR runs","whipped to the long leg boundary. Full and in at off stump, walks into the off side and uses the angle to find that boundary. Expertly done"
13.2,"Dubey to Jagadeesan, 1 run","run-out missed and overthrows at deep midwicket. Good length ball just outside off, punched to extra cover. Rayudu wants the run and is too slow to turn. Finch misses at the non-striker's end"
13.1,"Dubey to Jagadeesan, FOUR runs","oh another gorgeous shot from Jagadeesan. Short and climbing into him. Not a lot of pace on that and he eats into it. A controlled pull, placed to deep midwicket's right with the perfect balance"
12.6,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, 1 run",at the stumps and punched down to long-on
12.6,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, 1 wide","good length and spinning away, wide outside off. Too far for the sweep. Too far anyway, thinks umpire"
12.5,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, FOUR runs","gets the reverse sweep over short third man. Lovely execution. Actually, on second look, that's a switch hit because he's switched to a left-hander's grip. This is good length and tossed wide. He reaches out and lifts it"
12.4,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run","good length at off stump, steps out and mistimes a slog to deep miwicket"
12.3,"Chahal to Rayudu, no run",nicely bowled. Lands this wide after he sees Rayudu shape to advance down the pitch. He retreats in the end and lets it go
12.2,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, 1 run","full, slow and wide outside off. Gets out a stride and looks to drive hard. Ends up slicing to sweeper cover"
12.1,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, FOUR runs","full on middle stump, gets down and sweeps firmly to deep square's left"
11.6,"Saini to Jagadeesan, 1 run","full and at off stump, 144kph. No stride as he looks to drive. It's off the toe-end to extra cover's left"
11.5,"Saini to Rayudu, 1 run","full toss outside off, sliced to sweeper's left"
11.4,"Saini to Rayudu, no run","good length and in the corridor, slanted in. Mistimed on-drive is picked up by midwicket to his left"
11.3,"Saini to Rayudu, no run",short and tucking him up at off stump. 143kph. Shuffles and can't get this glance square of midwicket
11.3,"Saini to Rayudu, 1 wide","short and down leg side, looks for the glance and is beaten"
11.2,"Saini to Rayudu, no run","slower short ball outside off, inside edge onto thigh as he looks for the pull"
11.1,"Saini to Rayudu, FOUR runs",just clears mid-off. Good length ball Offers the full face and drives on the up. It's off the low part of the bat but it's enough
10.6,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, 2 runs","good length at middle stump, whipped into the vacant square leg region"
10.5,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, no run","short and slow, wide outside off. Mistimed cut into the covers"
10.4,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run","good length at middle stump, punched to long-on"
10.3,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, 1 run","good length and just outside off, poked into the covers"
10.2,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, FOUR runs","drilled straight. He's got class, that's for sure. Good length ball outside off, steps out to meet that at the pitch and nails the connection. It's flat and to long-off's right. Elegant"
10.1,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run","good length at middle stump, on the back foot and taps this into the leg side"
9.6,"Morris to Jagadeesan, no run","and again. Short outside off, steps out and swishes under it to be beaten"
9.5,"Morris to Jagadeesan, no run",beaten on the cut again. Happened a couple of times today. Short and outside off and he's swishing from under it
9.4,"Morris to Rayudu, 1 run",short and up at the ribs. Subdued pull to deep square
9.3,"Morris to Rayudu, 2 runs","full slower ball outside off, attempted drive is off the thick inside edge to deep square's left"
9.2,"Morris to Rayudu, no run",good length and angled in at middle stump. Gets an early stride in and is cramped. Forced to nudge this to midwicket
9.1,"Morris to Rayudu, no run","good length and in at middle stump, defended into the leg side"
8.6,"Udana to Rayudu, 1 run",lands short of third man. Short ball at middle stump. He steps out and runs into its path. A forced ramp in the end but Chahal can't get close
8.5,"Udana to Jagadeesan, 1 run","short at the throat, a good looking hook into the turf, straight to fine leg"
8.4,"Udana to Rayudu, 1 run","length outside off, dropped into the off side with soft hands"
8.3,"Udana to Rayudu, FOUR runs",ramped over the keeper. Nicely done. Short and rising in the corridor. Not express pace that. He arches into the leg side and watches that lift off the face of his bat
8.2,"Udana to Jagadeesan, 1 run","good length and just outside off, defended into the covers"
8.1,"Udana to Rayudu, 1 run","good length outside off, driven on the up to long-off"

7.3,"Sundar to Rayudu, 1 run","short at leg stump, swiped to deep square"
7.2,"Sundar to Jagadeesan, 1 run","good length outside off, onto the back foot to stab this into the covers"
7.1,"Sundar to Rayudu, 1 run","good length on middle stump, flicked to deep square"
6.6,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, no run","tossed up slow, at 77kph, on off stump. Leans in for the drive with the turn but that holds its line and hits the top part of his bat"
6.5,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run",good length and at off stump. Onto the back foot to whip to deep square
6.4,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, 1 run","full outside off, gets to the pitch and flicks to long-on"
6.3,"Chahal to Rayudu, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
6.2,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, 1 run","tossed up outside off, leans in and taps it to point's right"
6.1,"Chahal to Jagadeesan, no run","short and just outside off, cut to backward point"
5.6,"Sundar to Jagadeesan, 1 run","short at middle stump, glanced to square leg's left off the back foot"
5.5,"Sundar to Jagadeesan, no run","good length at off stump, pushed into the covers off the back foot"
5.4,"Sundar to Watson, OUT","out goes middle stump! Washington sprints into the leg side and takes a leap in celebration. Good length at off stump, spinning in towards him. In Watson's defence, this is there for the sweep that he's attempted. But he's not got low enough for it. From the position he's in, he's probably better going with the slog sweep from under the ball. What he ends up doing is swiping above it and he's disappointed"
5.3,"Sundar to Watson, FOUR runs","lifted to the long leg boundary. Good length, down leg side, some pace on it - Watson down on one knee to sweep behind square"
5.2,"Sundar to Watson, no run","good length and pushed through at 100kph, at middle stump. Hurried on the attempted punch into the covers"
5.1,"Sundar to Watson, no run","good length on middle stump, flicked to midwicket"
4.6,"Saini to Rayudu, no run","full and just outside off, driven firmly to mid-off"
4.5,"Saini to Rayudu, no run","beaten on the cut. 143kph. Short and wide outside off, steps out and has made too much room. Swishing under that in the end"
4.4,"Saini to Rayudu, no run","past the outside edge. 142kph, rising up from a length. Rayudu defends for the angle into him and is caught inside the line"
4.3,"Saini to Rayudu, no run","good length and just outside off, punched crisply on the front foot, straight at the bowler"
4.2,"Saini to Rayudu, 2 runs","short and just outside off, chopped to third man's right"
4.1,"Saini to Rayudu, no run","full and into leg stump at 147kph. Looks to flick and cops that on the pad, outside the line of leg stump"
3.6,"Sundar to du Plessis, OUT","taken at deep square! Two miscues and then he nails one, but that is the bigger side and I think he was looking to go straigther. Flat good length ball at middle stump, he wants to pick that up but ends up getting under it a tad too much and it turns into a sweep of sorts by the end. Not a slog sweep though, and it's taken a few yards inside the boundary"
3.5,"Sundar to du Plessis, 2 runs","good length at middle stump, looks to reach out again for the lofted drive and gets a thick inside edge towards deep square"
3.4,"Sundar to du Plessis, 2 runs","lands safely to long-on's right. Good length ball, reaches out and closes the face on this on off stump. Was looking to whip over midwicket and gets only elevation on it"
3.3,"Sundar to Watson, 1 run","good length on middle, punched to long-on off the back foot"
3.2,"Sundar to Watson, no run","close call on the lbw. Good length and pushed through too quick for Watson to get hold of the sweep. Caught him at leg stump though, so possibly going down"
3.1,"Sundar to du Plessis, 1 run","good length at off stump, punched back at the bowler who can't hold on cleanly to his right"
2.6,"Udana to Watson, FOUR runs","swiped over square leg. Square leg and fine leg were both brought in for Watson this ball. It's a slower ball at a good length, middle stump line. He goes forward and lifts this with an upright sweep"
2.5,"Udana to du Plessis, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, cut straight to sweeper point"
2.4,"Udana to Watson, 1 run","dropped marginally shot, pulled firmly out to deep square"
2.3,"Udana to Watson, no run",good length and tight at middle stump. Forces him to defend on the front foot
2.2,"Udana to Watson, no run","good length and just outside off, punched to extra cover off the back foot"
2.1,"Udana to du Plessis, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to mid-off off the inside half"
1.6,"Saini to Watson, no run",good length and honing in at off stump. Watchfully defended into the covers
1.5,"Saini to Watson, no run","good length and in at the stumps, 141.9kph. Driven on the rise to mid-off"
1.4,"Saini to du Plessis, 1 run","good length outside off, leans in nicely for this drive on the rise but Washington puts in a tumbling stop to his left at mid-off"
1.4,"Saini to du Plessis, 1 wide","short and wide outside off, left alone. That was too high"
1.3,"Saini to du Plessis, no run","full and just outside off, looks to drive through the line and is beaten"
1.2,"Saini to du Plessis, no run","full and in at middle stump, defended down the pitch"
1.1,"Saini to du Plessis, no run","good length and just outside off, defended into the covers"
0.6,"Morris to Watson, no run","short and curving away outside off, gets the late cut straight to backward point"

0.4,"Morris to Watson, no run","short and wide outside off, cut on the bounce to backward point"
0.3,"Morris to Watson, FOUR runs",picked up over square leg. Morris with the inswinger this time at the stumps and Watson is waiting on it. Tiny stride to keep some room before he goes aerial with the flick
0.2,"Morris to Watson, no run",past the outside edge. Angled into the corridor and then straightening off the pitch as he brings down an angled bat to feel for this
0.1,"Morris to Watson, no run","beaten by an outswinger. Full and wide outside off, static feet as he has a swish at it"
19.6,"Bravo to Kohli, 1 run","yorker outside off, jammed to extra cover"
19.6,"Bravo to Kohli, 1 wide","contentious wide. Good length ball outside off, starts outside the tramline but dips in late. Kohli lets it go and he gets the run"
19.5,"Bravo to Kohli, 2 runs","shovelled to deep midwicket's right. Might feel he missed out there. It's a full toss wide outside off, he shuffles into line and deliberately closes the face on this. Square leg and fine leg were in"
19.4,"Bravo to Kohli, 2 runs","full and wide outside off, walks into that shot and drills firmly to long-off's left"
19.3,"Bravo to Kohli, 2 runs","full and just outside off, allows that on and slices to deep backward point's left. Curran swoops down on that and puts in the throw. Kohli hares back and slides right through the middle of the pitch to make his ground"
19.2,"Bravo to Kohli, 2 runs","dropped in the follow through but that is hit too hard for him to have a realistic chance. Full ball outside off, in the line again is Kohli and drills it to Bravo's left, at face height. Bursts through to long-off's right"
19.1,"Bravo to Kohli, FOUR runs","scooped it to vacant fine leg! Not a shot he ever plays. This is full and wide outside off, and he knows it's going to be there because there's no one behind square on the leg side. Gets in line, falls over but manages to get it there"
18.6,"Thakur to Dubey, no run","full and wide outside off, can't manage to get bat on that and looks disappointed that's not been balled wide"
18.5,"Thakur to Dubey, no run","yorker just outside off, jammed back down the pitch"
18.4,"Thakur to Dubey, 2 runs","just past Watson's grasp as he runs back from extra cover. Ovepitched ball ripe for the lofted drive, outside off. He's gone too hard and ends up slicing it high. Watson's not close to getting a hand on that"
18.3,"Thakur to Dubey, 2 runs","yorker just outside off, jammed down to long-off"
18.2,"Thakur to Kohli, 1 run",leaping up to stop that. Jagadeesan nearly pulls off a blinder at backward point. This is a full wide ball that he looks to slice over him at point. Stretches and jumps to get the right hand on this
18.2,"Thakur to Kohli, (no ball) 2 runs",dropped at deep square but that was a no-ball on height. Full toss at the ribs. Miscues the pull. Jadeja goes reverse cup to his right and puts it down which means a second and Kohli will be back on strike for the free hit
18.1,"Thakur to Kohli, SIX runs","pumped straight! Slower good length ball outside off, he steps out, meets it on the rise and puts one of the cleanest hits of the night. It's flat and to long-on's left"
17.6,"Sam Curran to Kohli, 1 run","full and wide outside off, steps out and has to reach out again. Gets it down to deep backward point"
17.5,"Sam Curran to Kohli, SIX runs","expertly picked over square leg! Incredible shot, this, a stroke of genius. It's a full ball angling away from middle stump but he's stepped down and into the off side to line this up at his feet. From there, the wrists do the work. A quick flick and that just clears the vacant boundary there"
17.5,"Sam Curran to Kohli, 1 wide","full and wide outside off, gets the stride into the leg side and has a one-handed swish at this. The angle's taken it away from him"
17.4,"Sam Curran to Kohli, 2 runs","low full toss wide outside off, chopped to sweeper's right"
17.3,"Sam Curran to Kohli, SIX runs",slugged over long-on. Poor length from Curran. Just short of a driving length and with a lot of room outside off. Plants the front leg down and drags it on the up with his quick wrists
17.3,"Sam Curran to Kohli, 1 wide","full and very wide outside off, left alone"
17.2,"Sam Curran to Dubey, 1 run","full and just outside off, jammed down to long-off"
17.1,"Sam Curran to Dubey, SIX runs","Jagadeesan drops it at long-off. And tips it over the boundary too. Overpitched ball is there for the pummel straight and that's what Dube goes for. Ends up slicing it off the low part of the bat, the outside part. Jagadeesan has a margin of about a a foot or two behind him but ends up reaching behind and to his right at the end. That momentum makes the ball bounce out of his hand and towards the hoarding"
16.6,"Thakur to Kohli, FOUR runs","whack. Fifty for Kohli. Short and into the hips, gets the weight onto the back foot and pulls with the angle to the long leg boundary"
16.5,"Thakur to Dubey, 1 run","full and just outside off, wants to crunch that wide of mid-off but it's off the toe-end to the fielder"
16.4,"Thakur to Dubey, FOUR runs","short at the ribs, rotates the upper body as he puts his weight into this pull shot to deep square's left"
16.3,"Thakur to Kohli, 1 run","good length on middle stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
16.2,"Thakur to Kohli, 2 runs","good length on middle stump, steps out and flicks to long-on's right"
16.1,"Thakur to Kohli, 2 runs",misfield by Faf at long-on. And an apology. Good length ball pushed gently towards him and he's slow getting down on that as he attacks it
15.6,"Karn to Dubey, FOUR runs","hammered! Whew. That was hit hard. Good length and pushed through flatter outside off. Stood there and sent it back, head height to have both bowler and umpire evading as he bisected them"
15.5,"Karn to Kohli, 1 run","tossed up at leg stump, driven to long-on"
15.4,"Karn to Dubey, 1 run","good length at middle stump, clipped into the midwicket region"
15.4,"Karn to Dubey, 1 wide","attempted googly is down leg side, left alone"

14.6,"Sam Curran to Dubey, no run","good length on middle stump, defended to midwicket off the back foot"
14.5,"Sam Curran to Kohli, 1 run","good length just outside off, punched on the rise to long-off"
14.4,"Sam Curran to Dubey, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
14.3,"Sam Curran to Sundar, OUT","easily taken to his left by Dhoni. Short and wide outside off, looks to lace this behind square on the off side, absolutely chucks the hands at it. Can manage only a thick edge"
14.2,"Sam Curran to Kohli, 1 run","length at middle stump, punched to long-on"
14.1,"Sam Curran to Kohli, SIX runs","a leading edge in line with the stumps and over the keeper. Short at leg stump, steps out and looks to pull from his hips. Face closed very early but he's got more than he would have if he'd got that off the middle"
13.6,"Jadeja to Kohli, 1 run","full on off stump, driven to long-off"
13.5,"Jadeja to Kohli, 2 runs","short of a length just outside off, mistimed cut to sweeper's left as this skids on"
13.4,"Jadeja to Sundar, 1 run","short and on the pads, flicked to deep backward square"
13.3,"Jadeja to Sundar, no run","short and wide outside off, punched straight to extra cover"
13.2,"Jadeja to Kohli, 1 run","good length and turning away outside off, jabbed into the covers"
13.1,"Jadeja to Kohli, no run",appeal for lbw and then catch. Good length and sliding into the pad as he looks to flick. Going down leg and there was no bat so Dhoni's catch isn't all Jadeja thinks it is
12.6,"Karn to Kohli, 1 run","full on off stump, jammed down to long-on"
12.5,"Karn to Sundar, 1 run","good length at middle stump, punched to deep midwicket off the back foot"
12.4,"Karn to Sundar, SIX runs",launched over long-on. Full and faster outside off this time. Good pace for a ball pitching just outside off if you're looking to slog. It's what he does and it's controlled
12.3,"Karn to Kohli, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven to long-on's left"
12.2,"Karn to Kohli, 2 runs","full at off stump, driven with the turn to long-off's right"

11.5,"Jadeja to Kohli, no run","good length on middle stump, defended down the pitch"
11.4,"Jadeja to Sundar, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut into the point region"
11.3,"Jadeja to Sundar, no run","appeal for lbw as he looks for the reverse sweep. Jadeja is around the wicket and turns this in from outside off. Caught in front of the stumps, but was that glove first? Looks like it"
11.2,"Jadeja to Sundar, no run","good length outside off, pushed into the off side on the front foot"
11.1,"Jadeja to Kohli, 1 run","good length outside off, pushed into the covers"
10.6,"Thakur to Sundar, no run","good length and just outside off, mistimed punch into the covers"
10.5,"Thakur to AB, OUT","there's a sound and there's a wicket! AB de Villiers for a duck. Cross-seam delivery at a good length and in the corridor. He looks to drive from inside the line of that and gets a thin edge through to Dhoni. Thakur's penchant for getting the big players is alive - Russell in the last match, AB tonight"
10.4,"Thakur to AB, no run","short and in the corridor, drops the arms to let that go. It dips on Dhoni"
10.3,"Thakur to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length at leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
10.2,"Thakur to Padikkal, OUT","taken at mid-off. Good length and in the corridor. Padikkal looks to drive through the line to try and clear mid-off, but that sticks in the pitch and he's through it early. Bottom hand comes off as well and it's easily taken by Faf. Padikkal didn't come to terms with this pitch tonight"
10.1,"Thakur to Kohli, 1 run","just short of third man. Short and wide outside off, wants to slap that over the off side infield but it gets a bit wide for him and he's forced to open the face"
9.6,"Karn to Kohli, 1 run","good length at off stump, driven to long-off with the turn"
9.5,"Karn to Padikkal, 1 run","full outside off, steps out and jams it down to long-off"

6.3,"Bravo to Kohli, FOUR runs","oh crunched. A floaty half-volley outside off and he digs into this. It's a slower ball. Nice and low with the stride and past extra cover, to his left"

19.6,"Narine to Maxwell, FOUR runs","oh KKR win this by the barest of margins. Narine goes for the safe quick ball, wide outside off. Maxwell gets a play on the short boundary, but his body has fallen away so he doesn't get all of this. It goes high in the air over cover, and lands inches short of the boundary. Umpire Gaffaney's eye is sharp. He rules it four on the field. The replays confirm it. He has yorked the cover boundary"
19.5,"Narine to Mandeep, OUT",he goes for a six into the big side of the ground. Clever bowling from Narine. KKR are favourites now. He has holed out. Gets too much under this front-of-the-hand delivery. Taken at deep midwicket
19.4,"Narine to Maxwell, 1 leg bye","oh really slow offbreak again. Maxwell slogs again. Beaten again. This is some brave bowling. APpeal for lbw, not given out. They review it. This is turning down the leg side for mine. Yes it is missing. They get a leg-bye"
19.3,"Narine to Maxwell, FOUR runs","Maxwell keeps KXIP in it. He switches his stance, to play almost a pull shot over extra cover. This is some shot. Targets the short boundary"

19.1,"Narine to Maxwell, 2 runs","quick length ball, Maxwell makes room and swings, this goes off the toe end. The mis-hit means they have time to come back for two"
18.6,"Prasidh to Rahul, OUT","bowled'im. This is what happens when you leave yourself too much to do. Suddenly 74 off 58 doesn't look like a great effort after all. Full toss outside off, Rahul looks for the boundary into the leg side, and gets a big inside edge onto his wicket"
18.5,"Prasidh to Rahul, 2 runs","full and wide, hit straight to deep point, and Nagarkoti allows them a second. KKR won't be happy with that"
18.4,"Prasidh to Prabhsimran Singh, OUT",sharp offcutter bouncer. Singh is cramped as he looks to back away. Ends up trying to play an upper-cut but gets no power behind it because it has got big on him. Rana runs back from point to take the catch

16.4,"Varun to Pooran, no run","short of a length, wicket to wicket, defended back to him"
16.3,"Varun to Pooran, FOUR runs","Pooran mis-hits this, but the idea is right. He is going wide of long-off into the short boundary. It falls wide enough of the man, and also rolls along for four"

16.1,"Varun to Rahul, 1 run",driven to deep cover for one

15.3,"Nagarkoti, to Rahul, 2 runs","full and straight, uses soft hands to place it wide of long-on for two"
15.2,"Nagarkoti, to Rahul, FOUR runs","ordinary bowling. Strong leg-side field, and he goes wide. The length is good, into the surface, but the width means he can cut it away for four"
15.1,"Nagarkoti, to Rahul, 2 runs","wide length ball, driven on the up, straight of deep cover. Easy two"
14.6,"Prasidh to Pooran, no run","stays short of a length, pitches outside leg, headed towards off. Defended to short cover, who is tight on the single"

12.4,"Cummins to Agarwal, 1 run","short ball, hurries him into the pull, but he manages to keep it short of deep midwicket. That is fifty for Agarwal too. He has been the life force of this innings"
12.3,"Cummins to Rahul, 1 run","full and straight, hit down to long-on for one"
12.2,"Cummins to Rahul, FOUR runs","lovely shot. That is the touch of Rahul. Wide length ball, and he pushes this with soft hands, wide of mid-off, and Russell is ginger in the chase. That is fifty for Rahul"

10.5,"Nagarkoti, to Agarwal, 1 run","full, just outside off, dug out to deep cover for one"
10.4,"Nagarkoti, to Agarwal, FOUR runs","Agarwal places the pull wide of deep square leg. Nagarkoti bowls the short ball with a fielder back for it, but he pulls this in front of square. This over is breaking the shackles the spinners briefly imposed"

Prasidh bowl on a length, the ball stops and Rahul gets under it, skying it over mid-off. Russell makes good ground, gets side-on, but the ball slips out.

19.5,"Jordan to Karthik, no run","full and wide. Just short of being a yorker, but Karthik can't get under it. Beaten"

18.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Russell, OUT","Arshdeep has got the big wicket of Russell. That might be worth 10 runs. He stays away from the swinging arc. Bowls full and wide, and the angle takes it further away. All Russell manages is an outside edge to the keeper"
18.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Russell, FOUR runs","wide yorker, but Russell gets enough bat on it to place it between the keeper and third man. Not that he is looking to place. He is just trying to get some bat on it. And it flies off the edge"

16.6,"Jordan to Gill, 2 runs","wide length ball, Gill puts his wicket on the line to try to bring Karthik back on strike for the start of the next over.

16.5,"Jordan to Karthik, 1 run","wide length ball, and Karthik shuffles across to work this into the leg side. Jordan does well by denying him access to a clean swing"
16.4,"Jordan to Karthik, FOUR runs","Jordan might tell you this has gone off the edge, but he still bowled a wide half-volley, which meant Karthik swung hard at it. The outside edge flew straight of short third man"
16.3,"Jordan to Karthik, SIX runs","big six. Slot ball from Jordan. Wide outside off, and he has missed the yorker. Karthik accepts the half-volley with glee, and sends it over long-off"
16.2,"Jordan to Karthik, FOUR runs","it doesn't matter if he has to go the bigger part of the ground. He gets under a wide length ball, and crashes it over extra cover for four"
16.1,"Jordan to Gill, 1 run","full and wide, dug out for one to extra cover"
15.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Karthik, FOUR runs","slower ball, short of a length, and Karthik gets inside the line to pull it between long leg and deep midwicket. Karthik showing his utility in this innings"
15.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Karthik, no run","bowls wide outside off, Karthik shuffles across, and it is not called wide even though it lands almost off the cut strip"
15.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Karthik, FOUR runs","slower ball, full outside off, and Karthik picks on the short fence with a hit over wide cover. Wide half-volley really. And mid-off is up"
15.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Karthik, no run","full and wide, appeal for a catch at the wicket, but the bat has hit the ground to create that noise"
15.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Karthik, FOUR runs","short, on-pace, and he goes back to pull this between long leg and deep square leg. Into the big boundary"
15.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Karthik, 2 runs","slower-ball bouncer, he helps it along with the pull, places it fine of fine leg and comes back for two"
14.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Karthik, 1 run","on a length, on the pads, helped around the corner for one"
14.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 1 run","legbreak, too short, hit hard to long-off for one"
14.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 2 runs","legbreak, on a length, soft hands to go wide and short of long-off so that he can come back for an easy second"
14.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, FOUR runs","wrong'un, too short, too straight, and pulled into the small side of the ground. That brings up Gill's fifty"
14.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, no run","short of a length, not too wide, can't place the cut past point"
14.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 2 runs","driven down to long-off, just wide of him, as he bowls length"
13.6,"Mujeeb to Karthik, SIX runs","carrom ball, dragged short, Karthik stands his griund and muscles it down the ground. Just enough in it to clear long-on for an important six"
13.5,"Mujeeb to Karthik, 2 runs","another ball sitting in the surface. Karthik is looking to go over extra but ends up hitting this back over his head. Maxwell is wide at long-on, and runs across to his left to make a one-handed save to deny them two runs"
13.4,"Mujeeb to Gill, 1 run","wrong'un, short of a length, punched to deep cover for one"
13.3,"Mujeeb to Gill, 2 runs","another carrom ball, driven wide of-long-off for two"
13.2,"Mujeeb to Gill, FOUR runs","tries the big slog, and it works. Looks to go over long-on, but the carrom ball turns away to take a healthy edge straight of short third man"
13.1,"Mujeeb to Karthik, 1 run","offbreak, on the pads, clipped away for a single"
12.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 2 runs","short of a length, pulled straight of long-on, and they scamper back for two"
12.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Karthik, 1 run","full, outside off, chipped down to long-off for one"
12.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Karthik, 2 runs","legbreak, short of a length, punched in front of deep cover for a two into the bigger side of the ground"
12.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Karthik, no run","wrong'un, Karthik looks for the cut, but is cramped by it. Bottom edge goes to point"
12.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 1 run","short, straight, pulled to wide long-on"
12.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Karthik, 1 run","flat, on a length, outside off, pushed into the covers"
11.6,"Mujeeb to Gill, no run","short of a length, wide, looks for the late cut, but can't beat the man at point"
11.5,"Mujeeb to Gill, no run",has he picked the googly and tried to slog-sweep him? Doesn't matter. He has found short midwicket
11.4,"Mujeeb to Gill, no run","another offbreak to handcuff him, played straight to cover-point"
11.3,"Mujeeb to Gill, no run","offbreak to cramp him up, played defensively"
11.2,"Mujeeb to Gill, FOUR runs","short of a length, outside off, and he picks on the short boundary, punching this in front of deep cover. The dive is a little belated at the boundary"
11.1,"Mujeeb to Gill, no run","full, quick, pushed to extra cover"
10.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Karthik, no run","full, just outside off, defended back to him"
10.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, straight, pulled to long leg for one"
10.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Morgan, OUT","Morgan perishes. He is looking to go over the short off-side boundary, and he has picked the wrong'un to do so, but the ball sits in the surface and he is early into the shot, ending up dragging this to long-on for an easy catch"
10.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 1 run","legbreak, short, outside off, cut to deep point"
10.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Morgan, 1 run","wrong'un, short, pulled but not clean. Gets a single"

9.6,"Mujeeb to Gill, 1 run","offbreak, punched down to long-on for one"
9.5,"Mujeeb to Morgan, 1 run",gets this to turn away and use the angle to push it further away. Cut away for one
9.4,"Mujeeb to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, cut away to deep cover"
9.3,"Mujeeb to Morgan, 1 run","quick length ball, into the pads, pushed into the leg side for one"
9.2,"Mujeeb to Morgan, SIX runs",Morgan picks the short boundary and slog-sweeps Mujeeb over midwicket. Smart batting. A master No. 4 at work. Not sure why bowl the carrom ball and turn it into the shorter side?
9.1,"Mujeeb to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, wide, looks like a legbreak, cut away to deep cover"
8.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover. Good way to protect a good over. Bowl short of a length, and don't give them room"
8.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Gill, 2 runs","quick slider, into the pads, tickled away fine of fine leg for two"
8.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Morgan, 1 run","gets bat on this reverse sweep, but can't beat short third man"
8.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Morgan, no run","on a length, on off, seems like a wrong'un, and beats him on the defensive push"
8.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Morgan, no run","slider outside off, short of a length, cut away, but straight to point"
8.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Morgan, no run","and expecting a googly, Morgan goes for a revere sweep first up. Beaten"
7.6,"Jordan to Gill, 2 runs","slower ball, on a length, on the pads, worked past short fine leg. The dive from the fielder, and the consequent touch, possibly deflects the ball away from the line of the deep backward square running in. They take the second"
7.5,"Jordan to Morgan, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, tucked off the hip for one"
7.4,"Jordan to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, worked into the leg side for a single"
7.3,"Jordan to Morgan, 1 run","short of a length, angling into off, he opens the face late, and places this fine of third man"
7.2,"Jordan to Morgan, no run","down the wicket, but Jordan holds his own and shortens the length and cramps him up to draw a dot"
7.1,"Jordan to Morgan, 2 runs","push-drives this length ball on the up, places this wide of mid-off, gets a couple into the big boundary"
6.6,"Mujeeb to Morgan, 1 run",worked into the unmanned 30-yard circle on the leg side for a single
6.5,"Mujeeb to Morgan, FOUR runs","reverse sweep, nails it, over point, gets four to the short off-side biundary"
6.4,"Mujeeb to Morgan, no run","looks for the lap sweep as he sees a wristspun delivery, but this is a googly and he has lapped this into his own helmet. It lands safe"
6.4,"Mujeeb to Morgan, 3 wide","wide down the leg side, plus two byes"
6.3,"Mujeeb to Gill, 1 run","offbreak, short of a length, worked around the corner for one"
6.2,"Mujeeb to Gill, 2 runs","short of a length, outside off, this time he has punched him to the left of deep cover for two more"
6.1,"Mujeeb to Gill, 2 runs","short of a length, turns away, punched wide of deep cover for two. Into the bigger side of the ground"
5.6,"Shami to Gill, 1 run","on a length, outside off, pushed wide of mid-off for one"
5.5,"Shami to Morgan, 1 run","yorker, right on the crease, dug out to cover for one"
5.4,"Shami to Morgan, no run","on a length, 139ks, just outside off, he makes room and pushes this to cover-point"
5.3,"Shami to Morgan, FOUR runs","too short this time, and it doesn't get high. About midriff-high, and he pulls it into the short boundary for four. A thousand IPL runs for Morgan"
5.2,"Shami to Morgan, no run","short of a length, cramping him up with the angle, hitting him high on the pad"
5.1,"Shami to Morgan, no run","short of a length, into the armpit, fended to leg"
4.6,"Jordan to Gill, no run","misses out. A leg-side length ball, and he can easily clip it away for four, but is hit on the pad as he moves too far across"
4.5,"Jordan to Gill, FOUR runs","too straight this time. The length remains the same, but it is just a touch down leg, and the boundary is short on that side. Helps it away for four"
4.4,"Jordan to Gill, no run",another dot as Jordan stays short of a length. Pushed back to him
4.3,"Jordan to Gill, no run","short of a length, no room, Gill doesn't like this. Hit straight to cover-point. Needs to learn how to work singles off these deliveries if he can't hit boundaries off short-of-a-length deliveries"
4.2,"Jordan to Gill, no run",driven on the up as Jordan stays back of a length. Dot to mid-off
4.1,"Jordan to Gill, no run","short of a length, straight, punched towards mid-off"
3.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Morgan, no run","cramps him up with a length ball, defended to leg"
3.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Morgan, no run",uppish to mid-on as Morgan defends a length ball that stops at him
3.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, straight, pulled to deep square leg"
3.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Gill, OUT","both batsmen at the same end. Disastrous start for KKR. Gill plays this straight to short fine, and should be responding to the non-striker's call. I don't care if there is a single or not, you have to trust your partner if he is a specialist batsman and is running to the danger end. Gill preserves himself. Shami's throw from short fine comes at the wrong end, but Pooran collects it at cover and strolls to the non-striker's to run Rana out"
3.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Rana, 1 run","short of a length, at he stumps, played uppishly past midwicket for one"
3.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Rana, no run",and the plan for Rana seems to be to not pitch anything in his half. He ducks this short ball
2.6,"Shami to Rana, 1 run","Prabhdeep is wrong-footed. Brute of a bouncer, at his face, Rana fends awkwardly, and the ball flies off the back of the bat to where the keeper would have been. But Prabhdeep was following the angle of the bouncer, and had moved down the leg side"
2.5,"Shami to Rana, no run","short of a length, chest-high, and he pushes inside its line"
2.4,"Shami to Tripathi, OUT","timber. Shami bowls seam-up, targetting the stumps, and gets appreciable seam movement from a length outside off, and knocks back the middle stump and send the leg stump flying. True to his role, Tripathi is trying to clear the infield, and not defend or nudge"
2.3,"Shami to Tripathi, FOUR runs","and finally gets a short ball that is not shoulder high, and breaks the shackles with a pull into the smaller part of the ground. He has half-volleyed the boundary skirting at deep square leg"
2.2,"Shami to Tripathi, no run","sharp bouncer. At him, no room, 135ks. Tripathi is ducking and hooking at the same time. Beaten"
2.1,"Shami to Gill, 1 run","short of a length, 137ks, gets dome width, looks to cut, but it gets big on him, and he gets a bottom edge for a single"
1.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, no run","maiden over. Ends with a length ball within the stumps, and draws a defensive push from Tripathi. Excellent start from Arshdeep"
1.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, no run","appeal for a catch at the wicket. Bouncer, over his left shoulder, Tripathi hooks and is beaten. This wicketkeeper is quite excitable, and appeals for anything"
1.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, no run","beaten outside off. Pitched up, wide, going with the angle. Tripathi tries the big drive, and is nowhere near it"
1.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, no run","leading edge, nearly caught at cover. This one swings back a touch. Tripathi looks to work this to leg, but it doesn't swing as much as he expects it to. The leading edge doesn't carry to the diving Pooran at short cover"
1.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, no run","doesn't carry to the keeper. Short and wide, he cuts at it, the ball doesn't quite come on, takes the bottom edge, and falls short of the diving keeper, Prabhsimran"
1.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Tripathi, no run","some seam movement there? On a length, shaping up to swing from outside off, and then pitching and leaving him, beating the defensive push"
0.6,"Shami to Gill, no run","short of a length, 141ks, wide outside off, third leave of the over. This one nips back in after crossing the stumps"
0.5,"Shami to Gill, no run","short of a length, wide outside off, 140ks, left alone"
0.4,"Shami to Gill, FOUR runs","again short of a length, and this nips too far down leg. Gill nicely nudges it wide of short fine leg into the short boundary"
0.3,"Shami to Gill, 2 runs","short of a length, into the pads, tucked in front of long leg for two"
0.2,"Shami to Gill, no run","wide length ball, left alone. It holds its line"
0.1,"Shami to Tripathi, 1 leg bye","on a length, swift, into the pads, goes for a leg-bye"
19.4,"Rabada to Aaron, OUT",looks to ramp a slower short ball but sends it only as far as a limping Pant can go to catch. Is it a cramp or is it a strain? Rabada has three
19.3,"Rabada to Kartik Tyagi, 1 run","slower short ball, Tyagi pulls this down, gets a single"
19.2,"Rabada to Aaron, 1 run","quick, on a length, into the body, worked to leg"
19.1,"Rabada to Tewatia, OUT","another brace for Rabada. It is just crazy how often he has been getting these. Slower offcutter first up, Tewatia early into the slog, plays this on"
18.6,"Nortje to Tewatia, 1 run","slower ball, nearly a yorker, dug out for a single to keep the strike for the last over"
18.5,"Nortje to Tewatia, FOUR runs","Rabada drops. This short ball gets big on Tewatia, who pulls this more high than long. Rabada moves to his right at long leg, gets to it, but can't hold on. He is a few yards in so he has to leap. Had he been on the fence, this would be an easy catch"
18.4,"Nortje to Tewatia, no run","low full toss, driven to deep point, but he turns down the single again"
18.4,"Nortje to Tewatia, 1 wide","bouncer, 144ks, too high as he has dug this in too short"
18.3,"Nortje to Tewatia, no run","backs away, Nortje follows him, and he pulls but straight to long leg. Turns down the single"
18.3,"Nortje to Tewatia, 1 wide","slower ball, big wide down the leg side"
18.2,"Nortje to Tewatia, no run","wide on the crease, short of a length, on off, another defensive push"
18.1,"Nortje to Tewatia, no run","short of a length, no room, defended"
17.6,"Patel to Kartik Tyagi, no run","bouncer, well outside off, and Tyagi wants to have nothing to do with it"
17.5,"Patel to Tewatia, 1 run","slower short ball, no power in the pull, gets a single to deep midwicket"
17.4,"Patel to Tewatia, SIX runs","Tewatia has some belated fun. Gets an on-pace length ball on off, and uses the angle and the pace to hit him over cover-point for six"
17.3,"Patel to Kartik Tyagi, 1 run","slower ball, full, worked to midwicket for one"
17.2,"Patel to Gopal, OUT",Hetmyer you beautiful beautiful fielder. His second stunning diving catch in the deep. Gopal makes room to loft this length ball inside out. Hetmyer dives to his left and also in front to take this clean. The soft signal is out. The hard signal has to be out as he has his fingers under it. The third umpire is convinced after watching many replays
17.1,"Patel to Tewatia, 1 run","short of a length, around off, punched square and they are still diving around. Saves three runs"
16.6,"Nortje to Tewatia, 1 run","short, outside leg, and he pulls this straight to fine leg for one"
16.5,"Nortje to Gopal, 1 run",backs away to hit this to deep point for one
16.4,"Nortje to Tewatia, 1 run","short, into the hip, handcuffs him, pulled to long leg"
16.3,"Nortje to Tewatia, FOUR runs","short of a length, middle and off, nipping away, runs away off the outside edge for a four fine of third man"
16.2,"Nortje to Tewatia, SIX runs","full toss, on the pads, and he has somehow managed to put this over wide long-on. Not the cleanest of connections"
16.1,"Nortje to Tewatia, no run","quick length ball, driven straight to extra cover"
15.6,"Patel to Tewatia, 1 run","full toss, hit straight to long-off for a single"
15.5,"Patel to Tewatia, 2 runs","slower short ball, pulled away to the left of deep midwicket but Axar Patel puts in a diving save to save two runs. This is a great effort. The control on the ball is amazing. As his dive approaches the rope, he lets go off the ball"
15.4,"Patel to Tewatia, no run","on-pace short ball, Tewatia looks for the midwicket pull, is beaten outside off"
15.3,"Patel to Gopal, 1 run","full and straight, pushed to long-on for one"
15.3,"Patel to Gopal, 1 wide",slides down the leg side for a wide
15.2,"Patel to Tewatia, 1 run","slower offcutter, mis-hit between extra cover and long-off. Rabada puts in a full-length dive to try to catch it but I don't like seeing fast bowlers dive like this. Not worth the injury risk when the reward is a wicket when the game is already over"
15.1,"Patel to Tewatia, no run","and he bowls one first up. Short of a length, outside off, pulled back to him"
14.6,"Rabada to Tewatia, 1 run","short of a length, at him, ramped away to third man for one"
14.5,"Rabada to Archer, OUT",Archer fights the good fight but Rabada is too good for him. Gets too much under this length ball as he tries another swing for a six. Skies it for a catch in the long-off region
14.4,"Rabada to Tewatia, 1 run","short of a length, no room, and the best he can do is run this down to third man for one"
14.3,"Rabada to Tewatia, FOUR runs","full toss with mid-off up, and Tewatia goes over the man for four"
14.3,"Rabada to Archer, (no ball) 1 leg bye",Archer looks for that golf-swing six as Rabada bowls length. Beaten and hit on the back leg. This is a no-ball
14.2,"Rabada to Tewatia, 1 run","wide length ball, punched away, but can't beat that deep square third man"
14.1,"Rabada to Archer, 1 run","length ball, into the body. Archer hurried into the shot, hits to long leg on the bounce"
13.6,"Axar Patel to Archer, 1 run","fired into the pads, pushed towards long-on"
13.5,"Axar Patel to Tye, OUT","Rabada makes a routine catch look difficult but takes it sensationally with a dive. Tye has no option but to go after Axar as he pitches short, but he manages to hit this just to the right of deep midwicket. Rabada is late to move behind the ball, but then puts the dive in"
13.4,"Axar Patel to Tewatia, 1 run","quick length ball, outside off, pushed with soft hands for one"
13.3,"Axar Patel to Tewatia, no run","slower through the air, hit straight to extra cover. Another dot"

13.1,"Axar Patel to Tewatia, no run","arm ball, outside off, swings away, hit on the toe end"
12.6,"Stoinis to Tye, no run","slower short ball again, 118ks, and Tye is beaten on the pull again"
12.6,"Stoinis to Tye, 1 wide","slower offcutter, full, outside leg"
12.5,"Stoinis to Tye, SIX runs","lovely hit. Too late? Stoinis bowls on-pace, 131ks, full, in the slot, and he is drilled flat over long-off"
12.4,"Stoinis to Tye, no run",slight swing away as he pitches up. Pushed to cover. And Rahane fielding again. They have used him cleverly as a 12th man. Invariably he is on the field
12.3,"Stoinis to Tye, no run","slower short ball, but drop in pace, Tye connects with fresh air on the pull"
12.2,"Stoinis to Tye, no run","short of a length, hit hard, Stojnis fields to his left in the follow-through. Both the batsmen think there is an easy single on, and in the end have to rush back to their respective creases"
12.1,"Stoinis to Jaiswal, OUT","and this is how anchor jobs hurt teams. He has wasted more than a quarter of the innings for less than a run a ball and now he is out when trying to hit. Full offcutter, outside leg, beats his swing, hits his pad, and then the off stump"
11.6,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, 1 run","full, middle and leg, worked to leg for a single"
11.5,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, no run","hangs this one in the air, gets some dip on this, defended back to him"
11.4,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, FOUR runs",swept away. Possibly only the second boundary off Ashwin tonight. Along the ground and between deep square and deep midwicket
11.3,"Ashwin to Tewatia, 1 run","drifting into the pads, worked to leg"
11.2,"Ashwin to Lomror, OUT","and too easy for Ashwin. Nice drift, dip, and then some turn. Lomror looks to work to leg, and the leading edge is swallowed at short cover"
11.1,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, 1 run","just wide of Ashwin. Quick offbreak, leading edge, to the right of Ashwin, just out of reach. No need to dive now"
10.6,"Stoinis to Jaiswal, 1 run","full, on the toes, clipped away to deep midwicket"
10.5,"Stoinis to Lomror, 1 run","full and straight, played to mid-off with soft hands. They get a single"
10.4,"Stoinis to Jaiswal, 1 run","short, straight, pulled to deep midwicket for one"
10.3,"Stoinis to Samson, OUT","Stoinis. Turning everything he touches to gold. This is what happens when you show no intent against others and then are obligated to hit the change bowler for 25 runs. Samson swings at a length ball, and it sort of swings a touch and goes off the toe end. Million miles in the air. Caught at long-on"
10.2,"Stoinis to Jaiswal, 1 run","another length ball, 127ks, but Jaiswal has shuffled too far across and can't get any power into this. Just a single to long-on"
10.1,"Stoinis to Jaiswal, SIX runs",and Jaiswal decides it is time. Goes over the cow corner as Mujumdar suggested. Stoinis bowls an on-pace legnth ball. And he clears the front leg to send him out of the ground
9.6,"Axar Patel to Samson, no run","again he stays away from the slot. No room either. Samson wants a single to short fine, but Jaiswal sends him back. A direct hit would have had Samson here"
9.5,"Axar Patel to Jaiswal, 1 run","arm ball, short of a length, he doesn't let Jaiswal get under it. Punched down to long-on for one"
9.4,"Axar Patel to Samson, 3 runs","clever batting. Shuffles across, gets under a length ball, laps it for three"
9.3,"Axar Patel to Samson, no run","short of a length, no room, punched to point"
9.2,"Axar Patel to Jaiswal, 1 run","sweeps this from well outside off, in the air, and it bounces short of deep midwicket"
9.1,"Axar Patel to Samson, 1 run","slow, on a length, on off, pushed past cover-point for one"
8.6,"Nortje to Samson, 1 run","short of a length, quick, 150ks, and he goes back to run this down to third man"
8.5,"Nortje to Jaiswal, 1 run","short of a length, tucked away off the hip to long leg"
8.4,"Nortje to Samson, 1 leg bye",quick short-of-a-length ball here. beats him for pace. An inside edge gets them a single
8.3,"Nortje to Samson, no run","short of a length, slower ball, 125ks, runs this to point. Another dot"
8.2,"Nortje to Samson, no run","lbw appeal as this nips back in, but it has hit him outside the line. The umpire thinks so too. And DC think so too as they don't review this"
8.1,"Nortje to Smith, OUT","Hetmyer. What a lovely catch. Nortje comes back, pitches one up, Smith whips this to leg, and Hetmyer dives forward from deep square midwicket to take this clean. They go to the third umpire with the soft signal saying he is out. The replays confirm it"
7.6,"Patel to Smith, 1 run","another slower short ball, rib-high, pulled to deep square for one"
7.5,"Patel to Smith, no run","slower bouncer, Smith looks for the hook, aborts it. Then looks for the ramp, and aborts that too. Too little pace on it to try either"
7.4,"Patel to Jaiswal, 1 run","slower offcutter at 123ks again, no room to him, pushed towards short midwicket for one"
7.3,"Patel to Smith, 1 run","short of a length, wide, punched to deep cover for one"
7.2,"Patel to Smith, 2 runs","short of a length, at him, tucked away into a hole on the leg side for two. That is good placement on this ground"
7.1,"Patel to Jaiswal, 1 run","short of a length, at off, worked to deep midwicket for one"
6.6,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, 1 run","quick offbreak, just outdside off, pushed to the right of Ashwin, and he is not going to dive for these after having dislocated his shoulder once previously. They get the single"
6.5,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run","wide on the crease, under-cuts the ball, Smith pushes this length ball into the leg side for one"
6.4,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, 1 run","quick length-ball offbreak, he dabs down on it for a single"
6.3,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run","looks like an attempted legbreak, short, outside off, pulled off the toe end"
6.2,"Ashwin to Smith, FOUR runs","carrom ball. A touch too short, and he has pulled this from well outside off for a four through midwicket"
6.1,"Ashwin to Smith, no run","lovely bowling. Smith shapes up for the slog, but the dip on this means this is nowhere near his swinging arc. Smith does well to abort the slog and just defend"
6.1,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 wide",carrom ball. Starts too far outside leg. Wide
5.6,"Patel to Jaiswal, no run","short of a length, on-pace, 136ks, Jaiswal beaten on the punch. This is hurting RR, and Jaiswal needs to find a way here"
5.5,"Patel to Jaiswal, no run","slower ball, short of a length, outside off, punched to cover-point"
5.4,"Patel to Smith, 1 run","short of a length, wide outside off, punched away, and they get a single thanks to a Stoinis misfield at extra cover"
5.3,"Patel to Jaiswal, 1 run","short ball, slower at 123ks, outside leg, and all Jaiswal needs is a bit of bat to clear short fine leg. However, he is early into the shot and gets a single off the glove"
5.2,"Patel to Jaiswal, SIX runs",Jaiswal's first aerial hit as Harshal gives him an on-pace short ball. And this pace in the 130s works better for Jaiswal than Rabada and Nortje. Pulled away for a six
5.1,"Patel to Jaiswal, no run","starts with a slower offcutter at 128ks. Short of a length, runs off the outside edge to reach the keeper on the half-volley"
4.6,"Ashwin to Smith, no run","Smith backs away to punch a length ball to cover. No room, no time for him to manipulate the field. Another excellent over from Ashwin inside the Powerplay"
4.5,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, 1 run","drifting in, full, worked to leg for one"
4.4,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, no run","flighted offbreak outside off, driven hard and square, but straight to point. The pressure has to be building up"
4.3,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, no run","carrom ball. Flat, on a length, outside off. He looks to cut, and is beaten on the inside edge"
4.2,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run","offbreak that doesn't turn, on a length, outside off, worked to leg for one"
4.1,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, 1 run","length-ball offbreak, outside off, pushed towards long-off for one"
3.6,"Rabada to Smith, FOUR runs","this is some cricket. Rabada bowling quick and at him, and Smith looking to find runs. This is a bouncer, right at this body, Smith gets down on a knee and gets a top edge to clear short fine leg"
3.5,"Rabada to Smith, SIX runs","oh he has just cleared the man at long leg. This is an interesting hit. Smith stays in the crease and whips one from middle and off, and ends up dragging behind square. Just clears the man"
3.4,"Rabada to Smith, no run","on a length, stump to stump, pushed to mid-on. That is what Rabada is looking to do"
3.4,"Rabada to Smith, 1 wide",another wide down the leg side. Seems like a plan to cramp Smith up or look for lbw
3.3,"Rabada to Jaiswal, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, this time he has time to run this down to third man. Just seems hurried by quick bowling here"
3.2,"Rabada to Jaiswal, no run","on a length, outside off, driven on the up but straight to extra cover. Jaiswal getting stuck here like Tewatia did the other night"
3.1,"Rabada to Smith, 1 run","short of a length, around off, runs off the outer half of the bat for one"
3.1,"Rabada to Smith, 1 wide",wide down the leg side
2.6,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, no run","quick offbreak, on a length, outside off, hit straight to cover"
2.5,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, no run","accurate, no room, defended to leg"
2.4,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run","offbreak, tight line, pushed down to long-on for one"
2.3,"Ashwin to Buttler, OUT","not the Mankad, but the more prosaic catch at square leg. Lovely bowling I must say. Buttler is looking for the big hit over long-on/midwicket region, but he gets the ball to dip on him, and ends up hitting to square leg, where Dhawan takes a diving catch even as the ball swerves away from him. Out comes the thigh-five, and a big leap from Ashwin"
2.2,"Ashwin to Jaiswal, 1 run","Buttler doesn't back up. Drifting length ball, bunted into the leg side for one"
2.1,"Ashwin to Buttler, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched down to long-on for one"
1.6,"Nortje to Jaiswal, no run","short of a length, 143ks, good carry too, and beats Jaiswal as he looks to open the face on this"
1.5,"Nortje to Jaiswal, no run","quick bouncer, just 134ks on the radar, but this is quick. And on middle and leg. He ducks it"
1.4,"Nortje to Jaiswal, no run","short of a length, no room, pushed with an open face to point"
1.3,"Nortje to Jaiswal, no run","short of a length, around off, Jaiswal tries to run this down and is beaten. Not short enough for that shot"
1.2,"Nortje to Buttler, 1 run","short of a length, wicket to wicket, pushed wide of mid-on for one"
1.1,"Nortje to Buttler, 2 runs","short of a length, angling in, tucked away between square leg and midwicket"
0.6,"Rabada to Buttler, 1 run","lovely effort at mid-off. This a mis-hit off a length ball and is dying in front of mid-off, but Stoinis puts in a dive and still reaches it only on a half-volley"
0.5,"Rabada to Buttler, FOUR runs","short ball, 145ks, but it sits up, and Buttler has enough time to pull this through square leg. Along the ground"
0.4,"Rabada to Buttler, FOUR runs","strays too far down leg, and Buttler tickles this full ball along for four"
0.3,"Rabada to Buttler, no run","on a length, 145ks, on off, holds the line to hit the outside half of his bat"
0.2,"Rabada to Jaiswal, 1 run","short of a length, no room, but he has dabbed it wide of slip for one"
0.1,"Rabada to Jaiswal, no run","short ball, just outside off, good carry. Jaiswal sways inside its line"
19.6,"Archer to Ashwin, no run","short of a length, quick, 142ks, he looks to use his pace and steer him. Beaten. They don't even try to run the bye. This is poor. The last ball of the first innings should always feature a run-out if it is not hit for a boundary or any other dismissal"
19.5,"Archer to Rabada, 1 run","short of a length, at him, punched to backward point for one"
19.4,"Archer to Patel, OUT","slower ball, on a length, 126ks, on leg, and Harshal doesn't get room to swing on this slog. Caught at deep midwicket"
19.3,"Archer to Rabada, 1 run","quick and full again, hit down to long-on for one"
19.2,"Archer to Rabada, no run",full and wide and quick. Nearly a yorker. Beaten
19.1,"Archer to Patel, 1 run","yorker/low full toss, middle and leg, dug out for a single to extra cover"
18.6,"Tye to Axar Patel, OUT","gets the wicket. More importantly no run off it. Wide length ball, angling further way. Sure to be called a wide, but Axar manages to get the cue on it for a catch to Buttler"
18.5,"Tye to Axar Patel, FOUR runs","short, on-pace, wide outside off, and he has pulled this to deep midwicket. All the hard work done for DC going down the drain because of this over"
18.4,"Tye to Axar Patel, SIX runs","and this is in the slot, and Axar goes deep into the crease to smack him for a six back over his head"
18.4,"Tye to Axar Patel, (no ball) 4 byes","slips out. Horribly wrong. Just what DC needed, just what RR didn't. High full toss, and it reaches Buttler on a half-volley. He can't get his pads properly behind it. Four byes too"
18.3,"Tye to Patel, 1 run","low full toss, can't get under it, hit to long-off on the bounce"
18.2,"Tye to Axar Patel, 1 run","short of a length, 131ks, wide outside off, pulled off the cue end to long-on"
18.2,"Tye to Axar Patel, 1 wide","goes for the wide yorker, and despite Axar's shuffle across, it has been called wide. Because it has gone too wide, almost off the cut strip"
18.1,"Tye to Axar Patel, FOUR runs",plum on-pace half-volley at 133ks. Axar rockets this back over the non-striker's head for four
17.6,"Archer to Patel, FOUR runs","full, on off, Harshal makes room and goes deep in the crease to go over extra cover for four"
17.5,"Archer to Patel, no run","sharp bouncer, quick, and following him. Harshal has to act fast to avoid getting hit"
17.4,"Archer to Axar Patel, 1 run","another run-out missed. A slot ball hit straight to mid-off, and sets off for a single. Smith's throw is not accurate so Archer tries to collect it in front and deflect it onto the wicket. He is hit at the finger tip of the left hand"
17.4,"Archer to Axar Patel, 1 wide","length ball, angling in, wide down the leg side"
17.3,"Archer to Patel, 1 run","yorker, outside off, dug out to pint, and if Jaiswal hits the non-striker's end, Harshal is gone. He misses"
17.2,"Archer to Patel, 2 runs","slower ball, 127ks, on a length, on off, pushed past the ring on the off side and they charge back for a second"
17.1,"Archer to Axar Patel, 1 run","full toss, just outside off, pushed to point"
16.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Hetmyer, OUT","huge wicket. This could mean a difference of 20 runs. Tyagi bowls seam-up, quick, in the slot and just outside off. Hetmyer is looking at that wide long-on six, but the bat face turns in his hands as he connects. A smart overhead catch by Tewatia at long-on"
16.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Hetmyer, SIX runs","slower ball, on leg, in the slot, and Hetmyer clears the front leg to slog him for another six. Hetmyer hurting RR"
16.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Hetmyer, SIX runs","just clears long-off. That unnecessary overthrow hurts Tyagi. Full toss outside off, and he goes flat over long-off. And despite fielding on such a small ground, Archer is not right on the fence. That is a second fielder who has let Tyagi down this over"
16.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Patel, 1 run","wide full toss. Yorker gone wrong, but hit straight to point. No single available but a direct-hit overthrow will bring Hetmyer back on strike"
16.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Patel, no run","full and wide, drilled to mid-off. Just hit too well to get Hetmyer back on strike"
16.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Hetmyer, 1 leg bye","slot ball, but outside leg, and Hetmyer misses with the slog. Just the leg-bye"
15.6,"Tye to Hetmyer, 1 run",wide yorker to close the over out after one poor slot ball earlier in the over. Just the single. Good comeback. It is so important to make sure you don't go for 20-plus even if you get takes down early in the over
15.5,"Tye to Patel, 1 run","slower-ball yorker, on leg, dug out for one to deep midwicket"
15.4,"Tye to Hetmyer, 1 run","wide length ball, runs this down to third man for one"
15.3,"Tye to Hetmyer, SIX runs","wide on-pace length ball, and he goes inside-out with a drive over extra cover for a regal six"
15.2,"Tye to Hetmyer, FOUR runs","bouncer, at off, and he flat-bats it straight of long-on. Couldn't have planned it but it falls safe"
15.1,"Tye to Hetmyer, no run","wide length ball, 134ks, angles away and beats him"
14.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Hetmyer, 1 leg bye","full and quick, outside leg, hits him on the pad, concedes a leg-bye"
14.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Hetmyer, no run","goes for the wide yorker, change-up from 114ks to 137ks, beats him outside off"
14.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Hetmyer, SIX runs","another slower short ball looking to tuck him up, but in the process he goes too far down leg, and Hetmyer gets inside the line and helps it along for a small six over long leg"
14.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Patel, 1 run","short of a length, at off, steered to third man"
14.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Patel, 2 runs","wide length ball, driven on the up, straight of deep cover, comes back for two"
14.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Hetmyer, 1 run","slower ball, 117ks, short of a length, tucked away off the hip for one"
13.6,"Tewatia to Patel, no run","full and straight, blocked back to him"
13.5,"Tewatia to Patel, 2 runs","and now he bowls a slow loopy legbreak, takes the thick outside edge and rolls past short third man"
13.4,"Tewatia to Patel, no run","on a length, wicket to wicket, defended back to him"
13.3,"Tewatia to Stoinis, OUT","and that is the icing on the cake that Tewatia's spell has been. I suppose Ponting will acknowledge Tewatia now. ""You have to fight for what you are owed."" He has got the danger man out. Short of a length, wide, legbreak so it turns away too. Stoinis nowhere near it but still cuts. The top edge settles with cover-point"
13.2,"Tewatia to Hetmyer, 1 run","short of a length, wide, cut away to deep point"
13.1,"Tewatia to Stoinis, 1 leg bye","beaten in the flight as Stoinis jumps out of the crease. Big appeal for lbw but he is too far down the wicket. Another slider, and seems to have hit him inside the line. Not sure how far down Stoinis is, though, vis-a-vis DRS. They don't go upstairs anyway"
12.6,"Tye to Stoinis, 1 run","slower-ball yorker, 120ks, pretty straight, dug out wide of short fine leg for one"
12.5,"Tye to Stoinis, 2 runs","full and wide, 131ks, driven off the toe end in front of deep cover"
12.4,"Tye to Hetmyer, 1 run","on a length, angling in, 138ks, hits his leading edge and goes for a single to extra cover"
12.3,"Tye to Hetmyer, SIX runs","on-pace short ball, 133ks, at his body, Hetmyer gets inside the line and pulls this for a flat six over square leg"
12.2,"Tye to Stoinis, 1 run","slower short ball, runs this down to third man for one"
12.1,"Tye to Stoinis, no run","wide length ball, 136ks, but just inside the line. Left alone by Stoinis"
11.6,"Tewatia to Stoinis, 1 run","another boundary-less over from Tewatia. What an effort Tewatia is putting in against the team that didn't retain him. Again that in-between length, and no room. Just the single to long-on"
11.5,"Tewatia to Hetmyer, 1 run",pulled away to deep midwicket for one
11.4,"Tewatia to Stoinis, 1 run","short of a length, legbreak, turns away, which means he punches down to long-off for one"
11.3,"Tewatia to Hetmyer, 1 run","on a length, outside off, cut away past the diving fielder at point, but gets just a single to deep cover"
11.2,"Tewatia to Hetmyer, no run","short of a length, outside off, punched to extra cover. Another dot"
11.1,"Tewatia to Hetmyer, no run","on a length, outside off, steered to short third man"
10.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Stoinis, no run",closes out a lovely over with a perfect inswinger that cannot be driven or pulled. And it is aimed at top of off. Defended back to him
10.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Hetmyer, 1 run","slower bouncer, and Hetmyer is very early into the hook. The front edge, though, doesn't travel as far as square leg"
10.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Stoinis, 1 run","short of a length, around off, pushed towards mid-on"
10.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Hetmyer, 1 run","sharp bouncer, 137ks, at him, higher than the shoulder, hits the glove, but there is no leg gully"
10.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Stoinis, 1 run","shanked away as he looks to pull, but it falls well short of deep midwicket"
10.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Hetmyer, 1 run","short of a length, at him. tucked away off the hip for one to deep midwicket"
9.6,"Tewatia to Stoinis, no run","quick legbreak, pushes him back, runs off the leading edge to short cover"
9.5,"Tewatia to Hetmyer, 1 run","short of a length, around off, punched to deep cover"
9.4,"Tewatia to Stoinis, 1 run","low full toss, on off, driven to long-off for one"
9.3,"Tewatia to Stoinis, SIX runs","Sixer Stoinis keps hitting them out of the field. Tewatia makes the mistake of pitching one up, and he goes over long-off for another big six"
9.2,"Tewatia to Stoinis, OUT","one more run-out. Pant just puts his head down and runs with Stoinis not even moving. This is poor running from Pant. Stoinis pushes this straight to short midwicket and takes a couple of instinctive steps down the wicket. Only to realise Pant is there looking into his eyes. All you can say is, this is Stoinis's call, and Pant should have waited for it"
9.1,"Tewatia to Pant, 1 run","as expected, he bowls short and wide, with no turn, and Pant cuts to deep point again"
8.6,"Gopal to Pant, 1 run","slider, short, outside off, cut to deep cover"
8.5,"Gopal to Stoinis, 1 run","on a length, straight, pushed to long-on for one"
8.4,"Gopal to Stoinis, no run","Gopal saves one this time. Short of a length, just outside off, punched down the ground but not past Gopal who dives to his left"
8.3,"Gopal to Stoinis, SIX runs","two dots and a six. A touch too full with the wide legbreak, and he goes inside-out despite a deep extra cover in place. Just extending his arms into the shot"
8.2,"Gopal to Stoinis, no run","on a length, outside off, pushed to short cover"
8.1,"Gopal to Stoinis, no run","on a length, straight, pushed towards mid-on but Jaiswal makes a superb save from short midwicket"
7.6,"Tewatia to Stoinis, 1 run","slider, on a length, into the pads, pushed down to long-on"
7.6,"Tewatia to Stoinis, 1 wide","he looks to stay away from his reach, and ends up bowling a wide"
7.5,"Tewatia to Stoinis, no run","quick legbreak, on a length, Stoinis caught on the back foot. The leading edge goes to cover"
7.4,"Tewatia to Stoinis, no run","flighted legbreak, too full to get any elevation. Hit straight to midwicket"
7.3,"Tewatia to Pant, 1 run","nearly chopped on. Leggies bowling wide sliders to Pant has been a common sight this IPL. He goes hard at it, gets a bottom edge but he is lucky this doesn't ricochet onto the wicket"
7.2,"Tewatia to Pant, no run","slider wide outside off, left alone"
7.1,"Tewatia to Stoinis, 1 run","legbreak, on a length, can't drive, can't pull. Pushed to deep cover for one"
6.6,"Gopal to Stoinis, 1 run","and another pull, but this is not that short so he mis-hits it to deep square for one"
6.5,"Gopal to Stoinis, SIX runs","not that short, but Stoinis nonchalantly goes back and uses his high grip to pull this over midwicket for a small flats ix"
6.4,"Gopal to Stoinis, SIX runs","Stoinis in golden touch. And great attitude. You have to put away bad balls here no matter how many wickets you have lost. This is a long hop, and he goes back to pull it over midwicket. Just misses a car outside the ground"
6.3,"Gopal to Pant, 1 run","short and wide, cut away hard to deep cover"
6.2,"Gopal to Stoinis, 1 run","flighted outside off, driven to long-off"
6.1,"Gopal to Stoinis, no run","wrong'un first up, on a length, punched to midwicket"
5.6,"Tye to Stoinis, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, pushed wide of extra cover for one"
5.5,"Tye to Iyer, OUT","that is a run-out. Iyer dives desperately to make it back, but gets up and keeps walking. This is a slower ball by Tye, short of a length, outside off, he pushes this towards cover and sets off. That is a poorly judged single because he has not waited for the ball to beat short cover. Jaiswal makes a diving save. Iyer is sent back. And Jaiswal hits the striker's end directly"
5.4,"Tye to Pant, 1 run","full toss outside off, played with an open face, gets a single to third man"
5.4,"Tye to Pant, 1 wide","bouncer, 136ks, too high. Called wide"
5.3,"Tye to Iyer, 1 run",Iyer shuffles across and flicks a full straight ball to leg
5.2,"Tye to Iyer, FOUR runs","short of a length, gentle pace of 124ks, and I don;t even think this is a slower ball. Punched away through covers"
5.1,"Tye to Iyer, no run","on a length, outside off, on-pace, pushed to cover"
4.6,"Archer to Pant, no run","quick sharp bouncer, on top of his front shoulder, Pant ducks inside its line"
4.5,"Archer to Pant, no run","short of a length, 139ks, rising towards his chest. Fended with the bottom hand off the handle"
4.4,"Archer to Pant, no run","on a length, around off, 150ks. Defended with an open face"
4.3,"Archer to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, around off, pushed towards cover for a single"
4.2,"Archer to Shaw, OUT","Archer gets Shaw. He does it all himself. Shaw is looking for the pull again, but this one is not as short as he expects it to be. Consequently a massive top edge takes fight for moon and comes down towards midwicket. Archer runs towards it, asks Shreyas Gopal to get out of the way, and takes the catch"
4.1,"Archer to Shaw, FOUR runs","bouncer, head high, at him, and Shaw hooks in the air. There is a deep backward square in place, but he has managed to get it in just in front of square"
3.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, no run","short of a length, chest high, just outside off. Defended"
3.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, 1 wide","another bouncer, gives him the width, Iyer throws his bat it, and is beaten. Called wide"
3.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, no run","bouncer, outside off, left alone by Iyer"
3.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, FOUR runs","unfortunate. Tyagi stays with the plan of bowling wide from wide on the crease. Iyer throws his bat at it, and the ball moves away to take the thick outside edge over short third man"
3.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, 2 runs","wide on the crease again, bowls a wide outswinger, driven off the to end past cover"
3.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, no run","lovely delivery. Wide on the crease, pitches short of a length, and then pitches and moves against the angle. Handy delivery even in a Test. Beats him"
3.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Iyer, no run","wide on the crease, angles a length ball in, punched to midwicket. Can't find the gap"
2.6,"Aaron to Shaw, SIX runs","slightly fuller than the short-of-a-length he has been bowling, and Shaw lofts him on the up, back over his head, for a dismissive six"
2.5,"Aaron to Shaw, 2 runs","yet another drop. Kartik Tyagi over-runs this one. Lovely bouncer, shoulder high, just outside off, draws the big top edge to a fine fine leg. Tyagi runs to his right, but he has misjudged it and gone past where the ball is dropping"
2.4,"Aaron to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, just outside off, punched wide of mid-off for one"
2.3,"Aaron to Iyer, FOUR runs","cross-seam bouncer, at his body, but Iyer pulls him over midwicket. The free hit has given him the freedom"
2.3,"Aaron to Iyer, (no ball) FOUR runs","Iyer has been handcuffed by the length last two balls, but here he moves away to create room and cuts this shortish ball past point. What's more? This is a no-ball too"
2.2,"Aaron to Iyer, no run","short of a length again, nips back in, cramps him up. He wants a single to cover-point but is sent back. Rightly too"
2.1,"Aaron to Iyer, no run","short of a length, stays low, just outside off, kept out"
1.6,"Archer to Shaw, no run","another bouncer, 138ks, Shaw sways out of its line and belatedly tries to ramp it too. Beaten"
1.5,"Archer to Iyer, 1 run","legcutter, 120ks, short of a length, just around off, pushed towards mid-on for one"
1.4,"Archer to Iyer, no run","bouncer first up, 138ks, just outside off, and Iyer stays inside its line"
1.3,"Archer to S Dhawan, OUT","Archer's first wicket in a Powerplay this year. It has taken him 51 balls. And this is not such a great ball. A length ball on the pads, and Dhawan likes the look of it. Looks to clear the ring on the leg side, but doesn't get the elevation he wants and also finds short midwicket to perfection"
1.2,"Archer to Shaw, 1 run","short of a length, at him, dropped at his feet for a single"
1.1,"Archer to Shaw, FOUR runs","and again, Archer is hit for a four first ball. Not a bad ball really. On a length, 138ks, not much room, but Shaw stays inside its line and drives it on the up through the covers"
0.6,"Aaron to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","Aaron fails to close a good over. Bowls a slower ball half-volley at 117ks. Dhawan loves it, and plays the pick-up over the leg side"
0.5,"Aaron to Shaw, 1 run","short, 135ks, gets a little big on him, hits him on the glove as he hooks. Falls safe. A single to long leg"
0.4,"Aaron to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, steered to square third man for one"
0.3,"Aaron to S Dhawan, no run","back of a length, 139ks, on the pads, hits him high on the pad"
0.2,"Aaron to Shaw, 1 run","Shaw shows his cards. Sees one on a length, and goes through the line. The mis-hit clears mid-on"
0.1,"Aaron to Shaw, no run","short of a length, just outside off, decent pace of 136ks, defended to point"
16.5,"Natarajan to Arshdeep Singh, OUT","taken at is that short mid-off? Appears so. Full at the stumps, Arshdeep has a crack at the drive, and finds Warner there who takes the catch and pumps his fists. The fist-pump of a captain who's finished the match with two fifth-bowler overs left"
16.4,"Natarajan to Arshdeep Singh, no run","yorker in at middle, jammed down the pitch"
16.3,"Natarajan to Arshdeep Singh, no run","yorker at middle stump, defended back to the bowler"
16.2,"Natarajan to Cottrell, OUT",nails it! Another sweet yorker from Natarajan. Straight for the base of middle stump and Cottrell swishes around it
16.1,"Natarajan to Ravi Bishnoi, 1 run","yorker at leg stump, backs into the leg side and pushes towards point"
15.6,"Sandeep to Cottrell, no run","full slower ball on middle stump, defended on the front foot"
15.5,"Sandeep to Ravi Bishnoi, 1 run","short at the hips, pulled to long leg"
15.4,"Sandeep to Ravi Bishnoi, no run","struck in the grille. Short ball gets too big for him as he looks to hook that. Bowler checks on him, umpire checks on him, and he's on his feet and ready to go"
15.3,"Sandeep to Ravi Bishnoi, FOUR runs","launches it over the bowler. Good length outside off, nicely forward and punched with conviction. Mid-off is in and long-on can't get to that"
15.2,"Sandeep to Ravi Bishnoi, no run","slower length ball outside off, blocked solidly on the front foot"
15.1,"Sandeep to Ravi Bishnoi, no run","full on off stump, defended off the back foot"
14.6,"Rashid Khan to Shami, OUT","pinned right in front. Googly rips back in, Shami is shaping for the cut and is caught in front of middle stump. No reviews to spare either, he thought that was going down"
14.5,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, OUT","taken at backward point. One of the best innings this season ends softly, almost tragically, because it has been played around a shambolic chase from KXIP. Pooran looking to farm the strike and play out Rashid, wants to chop this short ball into the covers after a couple of dot balls. Thick edge and a long, laboured walk back from Pooran. Would you blame him if he felt let down?"
14.4,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, no run","googly, full on middle stump, gets forward and drives to long-off"
14.3,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, no run","googly at a length, punched to long-off"
14.2,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, no run","good length just outside off, punched into the covers"
14.1,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, no run","beaten. Good length legbreak, just outside off, and he looks to defend for the angle"
13.6,"Ahmed to Ravi Bishnoi, no run","yorker at off stump, defended into the leg side"
13.5,"Ahmed to Mujeeb, OUT","big appeal for catch behind. Turned down. SRH don't review, but the umpires now send it upstairs with a soft signal not out. Yorker wide outside off, he looks to jab at that and there's a sound as it goes through to the keeper. Third umpire Barde said this review is for bump ball so the on-field umpire reckons there's bat on it. Which might well mean Mujeeb will go here, because that doesn't look close to being a bump ball, and it could be conclusive based on the replays. They haven't checked for the actual edge, no Ultra Edge used, so just to reiterate - the umpire thought that was edged. It's given out. But Mujeeb reviews that decision! Now we'll have Ultra Edge. Another can of worms here though - because Mujeeb was walking towards the dressing room as he turned back and made the signal for a review. Did he get adviced by the dugout? We don't know yet. What we do know - there is a spike as ball goes past bat. So the umpire's original decision, overturned by the umpire himself, is reviewed by the batsman, who is in fact, out. At the end of it all, KXIP are a review short. Welcome to cricket."
13.4,"Ahmed to Pooran, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
13.3,"Ahmed to Pooran, FOUR runs","brilliant work. Yorker tailed into the corridor, waits on that and opens the face perfectly to get this fine of third man"
13.2,"Ahmed to Pooran, FOUR runs","just short of deep square and past him in the end as he lunges forward for the catch. Slower short ball, nice swiping length, and swipe he does. Hits Samad's body on the half-volley and is past the boundary"
13.1,"Ahmed to Pooran, no run","short and wide outside off, cut to backward point"
12.6,"Rashid Khan to Mujeeb, no run","beaten. Good length and skidding on, wide outside off. Goes for the slog sweep and it's past him"

12.4,"Rashid Khan to Mujeeb, 1 run","good length on middle stump, tucked to long leg"
12.3,"Rashid Khan to Mandeep, OUT","through him! You can be watchful against Rashid, but that doesn't mean assured success. Good length, googly, rips sharply in as Mandeep is caught half on tCaught he front foot and half on the back, trying to read him off the pitch. You can't do that. It's past his frenzied late cut and into middle stump"
12.2,"Rashid Khan to Mandeep, 2 runs","short of a good length on middle stump, punched to long-on's right off the back foot"
12.1,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, 1 run","short and sliding on outside off, cut to sweeper cover"

11.4,"Sandeep to Mandeep, 1 run","good length outside off, chopped into the covers"
11.3,"Sandeep to Mandeep, no run","a mix-up but Pooran safe in the end. Good length ball, pushed to midwicket's left. Where it is Garg again. Mandeep went halfway down but Pooran probably saved a little because he was ball-watching. Apologies from Mandeep"
11.3,"Sandeep to Mandeep, 1 wide","short and wide outside off, left alone"
11.2,"Sandeep to Pooran, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, chopped to backward point"
11.1,"Sandeep to Mandeep, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, punched into the covers"
10.6,"Natarajan to Maxwell, OUT","oh they've got him at the non-striker's end, surely! Yes. Priyam Garg has sent Maxwell back. Superb, superb work. It's a good ball to start off, Natarajan nails the away-swinging yorker at middle stump. Maxwell jabs it in extra cover's direction. Garg with a clean pick up, a quick pivot to open his body up and hit the single stump on the bounce"
10.5,"Natarajan to Pooran, 1 run","full and curved in at middle stump, punched to long-off along the floor"
10.4,"Natarajan to Pooran, FOUR runs","low full toss on leg stump, allows that on and tickles it past short fine"

10.2,"Natarajan to Pooran, 1 run","low full toss on off stump, driven to long-off"
10.1,"Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 run","dropped. Natarajan can't react quickly to his left in the follow-through. It's an offcutter, good length at middle stump. Maxwell punches through the line too soon. That wasn't difficult by any means, a half-chance at worst, but decent height. Was caught off guard"
9.6,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, 1 run","good length outside off, defended into the covers"
9.5,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, no run","beaten. Good length and turning away outside off, looks to punch that through the covers"
9.4,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, 1 run",short of a length and skidded across him. Mistimed pull to deep midwicket
9.3,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, 1 run",good length and pushed through at middle stump. Flicked to short fine's left off the back foot
9.2,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, 1 run",good length and ripping into middle stump. Onto the back foot and he hurriedly punches to long-off
9.1,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, 1 run","short of a length at middle, pulled down to long-on"
8.6,"Abdul Samad to Pooran, no run",good length and cramping him at middle stump. Pushed into the covers off the back foot
8.5,"Abdul Samad to Pooran, SIX runs","and past deep midwicket this time! Front-of-the-hand quicker one, dropped short at middle stump. He pulls him off the front foot, flat and to the fielder's right"
8.4,"Abdul Samad to Pooran, SIX runs","17-ball fifty! Fastest this season. Samad has nowhere to look right now, this is some assault. Good lenth ball and pushed through wide outside off, extends the arms and slaps it on the rise over long-off. Special knock, this"
8.3,"Abdul Samad to Pooran, SIX runs","smoked over long-on! He won't let the allrounders off! Good length on middle stump, steps out and meet it at the pitch to absolutely pummel that"
8.2,"Abdul Samad to Pooran, FOUR runs","big dive to the right at long-off but Garg can't stop that. Good length, flat and pushed across him. Slapped firmly to the wide long-off boundary. Garg has a flap with his right hand but only manages to push it into the padding"
8.1,"Abdul Samad to Pooran, SIX runs","smoked over long-off. Full and wide outside off, just swings through the line and that's rapidly over the boundary"
7.6,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, no run","good length legbreak at off stump, defended to backward point off the outside edge"
7.5,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, no run","good length on middle stump, nudged to midwicket off the back foot"
7.4,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, no run","googly turning in from a length, at off stump. Blocked on the front foot"
7.3,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, 1 run",outside edge as he looks to pull a short ball going away from him. Short third man cleans up to his right
7.2,"Rashid Khan to Pooran, no run","short and just outside off, chopped straight to short third"
7.1,"Rashid Khan to Maxwell, 1 run",good length and turning away outside off. Maxwell is squared a touch as he drops this into the covers with soft hands
6.6,"Abhishek to Pooran, 2 runs","short of a length just outside off, cramped on the late cut and gets a thick outside edge fine of short third"
6.5,"Abhishek to Maxwell, 1 run","full outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
6.4,"Abhishek to Rahul, OUT","taken at deep backward square! Good length, tossed up slow at middle stump. Rahul looks for the sweep and gets a top edge that is quite easily pouched by Williamson"
6.3,"Abhishek to Pooran, 1 leg bye",good length and down leg side. Gets a glove to short fine as he looks to sweep
6.2,"Abhishek to Pooran, SIX runs","and again. Fuller, flatter, similar line outside off. And a similar shot, but this one is further back over long-on"
6.1,"Abhishek to Pooran, SIX runs","lifted to long-on's right. Wide of the crease, full and tossed into the arc outside off. Pooran waits on that and hits this pretty straight"
5.6,"Natarajan to Rahul, no run","low full toss punched straight to mid-on. He was dancing around a bit thinking of the scoop, but might have outfoxed himself by the end of the dance"
5.5,"Natarajan to Pooran, 1 run","low full toss on middle stump, flicked to midwicket's left"
5.4,"Natarajan to Pooran, no run","good length at middle stump, mistimed punch into the leg side"
5.3,"Natarajan to Pooran, SIX runs",incredible. There's a reason so many people fawn over this guy's abilities. This is good length ball at middle and he's barely moved. Static and languidly picking this up over long leg. You don't do this if you don't pick length really quickly
5.2,"Natarajan to Rahul, 1 leg bye","good length on leg stump, looks to ramp that fine, cops it on the thigh guard"
5.1,"Natarajan to Rahul, no run","good length on leg stump, flicked to midwicket"

4.4,"Ahmed to Pooran, no run","good length on off, defended off the back foot"
4.3,"Ahmed to Pooran, FOUR runs","oh yeah, sweet. Classy from Pooran. This is full outside off, bowling to the field, nothing wrong with it. Pooran gets a big stride out to meet that and times the cover drive perfectly. All balance, that"
4.2,"Ahmed to Prabhsimran Singh, OUT","oh he's crunched that straight to cover! Whew, he hit that so well! It's a short ball outside off and he's cut that with some bat speed, but it's straight into Garg's lap. A metre either side and I don't think he'd have got a hand on that"
4.1,"Ahmed to Prabhsimran Singh, FOUR runs","drilled past mid-off. Full and just outside off, good stride out and smoked it past mid-off's right hand"

3.5,"Natarajan to Prabhsimran Singh, 1 run","good length on off stump, defended to point off the back foot"
3.4,"Natarajan to Prabhsimran Singh, FOUR runs","full on leg stump, stands tall and whips that to mid-on's right"
3.3,"Natarajan to Rahul, 1 run",good length and pushed across the corridor. Looks to force a punch off the front foot. It's to mid-off's left off the toe-end

2.1,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","good length and in at the stumps, knocked towards mid-on"
1.6,"Ahmed to Rahul, 1 run","another run out appeal. At the striker's end this time. Bairstow tumbles over the stumps to gather this and whip the bails off. Simran might have just made it. He has. Length ball on middle, clipped to midwicket's right and a throw that didn't have too much venom. Needed a direct hit and needed it a little faster. Although there's a chance that might have been a direct hit without YJB's intervention"
1.5,"Ahmed to Rahul, 2 runs","full slower ball outside off, jabs at that with hard hands, ends up slicing it through the covers"
1.4,"Ahmed to Rahul, no run","good length just outside off, thick outside edge to short third as he defends inside the line"
1.3,"Ahmed to Agarwal, 1 run, OUT","mix-up and Agarwal is caught quite a way up the pitch. Been sold down the river by his old friend. Full inswinger just outside off, neatly punched wide of mid-off. Warner gives chase, puts in a slide and is back up quickly. Rahul sprints down for the second and then says no. Agarwal responds to his call and takes off too, but he's left with no chance as a result. Throw comes in one bounce and Khaleel is back to gather it"
1.2,"Ahmed to Rahul, 1 run","good length at the pads, allows that on and clips into vacant midwicket"
1.1,"Ahmed to Rahul, no run","short and across the corridor, beaten on the cut. That slid through under his shot"
0.6,"Sandeep to Agarwal, no run",short of a length and angled into the corridor. Chopped to backward point
0.5,"Sandeep to Agarwal, FOUR runs","oh sweet. Just gets the weight into the ball here outside off. It's good length outside off, never really uses a big stride but the timing and the weight into it means his cover drives always pack power. This one does and it's to extra cover's left"
0.4,"Sandeep to Agarwal, 2 runs","good length inswinger at leg stump, flicked to deep square's left"
0.3,"Sandeep to Agarwal, no run","good length and just outside off, chopped into the off side"
0.2,"Sandeep to Agarwal, 2 runs","full indipper outside off, half a stride down to loft this straight over the bowler. Bat shuffles in his hands a little. This plonks in the turf as md-on and mid-off run backwards"
0.1,"Sandeep to Rahul, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut off the inside half to backward point"
19.6,"Shami to Williamson, 2 runs","full outside off, driven firmly to sweeper's right"
19.5,"Shami to Abhishek, OUT","taken at deep midwicket. Low full toss angled into leg stump from around the wicket. Looks to time that, an aerial flick. But he's taken well inside the boundary"
19.4,"Shami to Williamson, 1 run","yorker at off stump, jammed into the off side"
19.3,"Shami to Williamson, SIX runs",lofted over the long-off boundary. Full slower ball outside off. He wanted to go over mid-off again and was just a touch too early. But he'd done it well enough for this to land over the line
19.2,"Shami to Williamson, FOUR runs","nicely put away. The calm head of Williamson. Low full toss outside off, holds his shape and opens the face as he lofts this over mid-off"
19.1,"Shami to Abhishek, 1 run","full and just outside off, mistimed slog to deep midwicket"
18.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Abhishek, 1 run",yorker at middle and leg. Jammed to mid-off
18.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Abhishek, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, pulled neatly and dragged wide of long-on. Sweet connection on that"
18.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Abhishek, no run",nutmegged. Full and tailing in late at leg stump. He looks to whip that behind square but misses as it dips on him
18.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Abhishek, SIX runs","just clears the line. Whew, that was a check-shot but it had enough after going over the bowler. Full and curving into middle stump. Went straight and managed to time it perfectly"
18.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Williamson, 1 run","full slower ball on middle stump, jabbed to extra cover"
18.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Garg, OUT","Pooran takes one to his right and screams. At long-on this time. Full and wobbly from around the wicket, at middle stump. Looks to drill this wide of long-on but can't get enough power on that"
17.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Williamson, 2 runs","short outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
17.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Abdul Samad, OUT","short and into leg stump. It's there for the pull but it looks like he's hurried there because he can only manage to loft this up with the angle, no real power on that and not even entirely a pull. A half-ramp. Catching practice at deep square"
17.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Abdul Samad, 2 runs","good length at middle, steps out and is not to the pitch, but adjusts and chips to long-on's right"
17.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Williamson, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
17.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Abdul Samad, 1 run","good length slider at middle stump, clipped into the leg side"
17.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Abdul Samad, FOUR runs","dropped at long-off! Good length ball just outside off, steps down to meet at the pitch and connect firmly on this lofted hit, but he hasn't managed any elevation. It's flat and to Pooran's left at head height and he only manages to tip this to his left and into the boundary"
16.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Abdul Samad, 1 run","full slower ball at off stump, flicked off the inside edge to short fine"
16.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Abdul Samad, no run","good length, slower ball at middle stump. Watchfully flicked to midwicket"

16.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Williamson, no run","good length on off stump, defended into the covers"
16.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Pandey, OUT","taken in the follow through! Clearly they meant to take all wickets at once with that big drought set-up. This is a cutter from around the wicket, good length and gripping at an off stump line. He wants to turn that into the leg side with the angle but that stops on him and it's a feeble push back at the bowler"
15.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Abdul Samad, no run","googly at a good length, in at off stump. Blocked on the front foot"
15.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pandey, 1 run","full on off stump, driven to long-off on the front foot"
15.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Bairstow, OUT","there's an lbw appeal and a run-out appeal. The run-out's been sent upstairs. At the striker's end. But it seems they've also referred for the lbw. So we'll be looking at that first. It was a slider at leg stump, Bairstow was struck on the back leg trying to whip into the leg side. That back leg is definitely in front of leg stump, but there were a couple of sounds Ultra Edge shows no bat and that is hitting leg stump. The decision will be overturned. Good review and what an over this is. Four dot balls and the two set batsmen gone. Bairstow falls short of a well-deserved hundred"
15.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Bairstow, no run","chopped to backward point. Another slider, coming into the corridor. He was hurried on that"
15.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Bairstow, no run","short and skidding on just outside off, chopped straight to point"
15.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Warner, OUT","taken at long-on. Bishnoi with a quicker one across the corridor, good length delivery. Pretty much his go-to against left-handers this season. Warner miscues the slog sweep and it's a nice friendly take for Maxwell"
14.6,"Cottrell to Bairstow, no run",good length and angled into middle stump. Mistimed drive rolls back at the bowler
14.5,"Cottrell to Warner, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven along the ground to sweeper cover"

13.5,"Mujeeb to Bairstow, no run","googly, good length and at off stump. Blocked on the front foot"
13.4,"Mujeeb to Bairstow, SIX runs","swiped to deep midwicket's left this time. Good length and pushed through fast at middle stump. Clears the front leg, weight on the back leg, and places this perfectly to the fielder's left"
13.3,"Mujeeb to Bairstow, SIX runs","nonchalant swipe over the bowler. Full and wide outside off, reaches out with extended arms and holds his shape as he watches this fly"
13.2,"Mujeeb to Warner, 1 run","full and into the pads, flicked to deep midwicket to bring up his fifty. Ninth in a row against KXIP"
13.1,"Mujeeb to Warner, 2 runs","short at off stump, drags this pull between deep midwicket and long-on"
12.6,"Shami to Warner, 1 run",yorker at off stump from around the wicket. Opens the face and chops this to backward point
12.5,"Shami to Bairstow, 1 run","oh well bowled. Yorker following him down leg side. Squeezed down to fine leg, just about"
12.4,"Shami to Bairstow, FOUR runs","hammered straight. Backs into the leg side, meets this off-stump full toss with the middle of the bat. Mid-off is in the circle"
12.3,"Shami to Bairstow, 2 runs","full and at the stumps, mistimed slog to long-on's right"
12.2,"Shami to Bairstow, no run",beaten as he gets down for the ramp. Anticipating a full one at the stumps there. But this is short of a good length and sailing past his right shoulder as he gets down
12.1,"Shami to Bairstow, no run","low full toss, mistimed drive straight to mid-off"
11.6,"Arshdeep Singh to Bairstow, 1 run","three runs saved at backward point. High full toss outside off, he looks to steer that between backward point and short third man. Can't beat the dive"

11.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Bairstow, no run",nutmegs him. Nicley done. Yorker just outside leg and past his attempted flick
11.1,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, 1 run","full inswinging yorker at leg stump, jammed into the covers"
10.6,"Maxwell to Bairstow, 2 runs","low full toss on middle stump, clipped expertly between deep midwicket and long-on"
10.5,"Maxwell to Bairstow, SIX runs","oh that sounds dangerous! Good things there's no one in the stands. He's changed his bat about three times in the last five minutes, but those arms are doing all the work right now. This is full and pushed wide outside off from around the wicket and he's down on his knee quickly to swing through this and send it into the second tier, in long-on's direction"
10.4,"Maxwell to Bairstow, SIX runs","swatted over midwicket. Short at middle stump, back in the crease and an easy swipe across the line of that. 90 metres"
10.3,"Maxwell to Bairstow, FOUR runs","slapped wide of long-off. Good length, wide and sliding away. Sits up at a good pace and he clubs it off the front foot. Mandeep does brilliantly to sprint across and get a hand to that, but it slips through"
10.2,"Maxwell to Warner, 1 run",late cut to short fine.Warner shapes for the switch-hit but has to adjust as Maxwell pushes this down leg side

8.6,"Mujeeb to Warner, 1 run","low full toss at the boots, flicked to deep midwicket"
8.5,"Mujeeb to Warner, SIX runs","pumped straight. Attempted googly it seems. But there's no grip, it slides off of a length on off stump. Warner has the front leg in the leg side and a bat swing to die for"

7.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Bairstow, SIX runs","drilled over long-on. Lands nicely in his swinging arc, just outside off, and he has nailed the connection on this lofted drive"
7.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Warner, 1 run","thick edge as he looks to drive a googly. Full and dipping outside off, lands to short third's left"

5.2,"Mujeeb to Warner, 1 run","short of a length and just outside off, mistimed cut into the covers"
5.1,"Mujeeb to Bairstow, 3 runs","good length and just outside off, quickly onto the back foot and punches it between cover and extra. Maxwell ends up stepping on the ball as he tries to backheel it at the boundary. Has a fall too, but he's smiling sheepishly about that surprisingly lazy effort for someone like him"
4.6,"Shami to Warner, no run","yorker at middle stump, hammed down the pitch"
4.5,"Shami to Warner, no run",full and in at middle stump. Mistimed push to midwicket off the inside half
4.4,"Shami to Warner, FOUR runs","slashed over backward point. Short and into the corridor, makes some extra room to swing from under that and he manages to do it"
4.3,"Shami to Warner, FOUR runs","mistimed but past mid-on. Short one gets big on him and his pull shot is bouncing to the right of mid-on, and once again Rahul's dive there won't help"
4.2,"Shami to Bairstow, 3 runs","dropped at mid-off. Tough, dipping chance low to the right for Rahul. Looks like he manages to get only one hand on it. Bairstow jumps down the track again, but it's a short delivery and he drives on the up off a high part of the bat. Rahul leaps to the tight and gets a hand on it, but wasn't close to holding on"
4.1,"Shami to Bairstow, no run","short of a length just outside off, walks down at him and gets out a short-arm pull. Can't beat midwicket to the right"
3.6,"Cottrell to Bairstow, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to sweeper cover"
3.5,"Cottrell to Bairstow, FOUR runs","clears short fine. Short ball into the hips, uses the angle to swipe it just past the fiedler's jump"
3.4,"Cottrell to Bairstow, no run","full and just outside off, crunched into the covers"
3.3,"Cottrell to Bairstow, FOUR runs","spanked wide of mid-off. Good length and across him again, but just outside off. Half a stride forward and punched on the up, into the turf and timed well enough"
3.2,"Cottrell to Bairstow, FOUR runs","slashed over cover. Good length and wide outside off, chucks his hands at that with the intention to go over the infield. That ball it's pace and angle, allows him to execute perfectly"
3.1,"Cottrell to Warner, 1 run","good length and in at middle, pushed into the off side with soft hands"
3.1,"Cottrell to Warner, 1 wide","full and down leg side, beaten on the flick"
2.6,"Shami to Bairstow, no run","good length and just outside off, punched into the covers off the back foot"
2.5,"Shami to Warner, 1 run","short of a good length, tucking him up at middle. Dropped into the covers with soft hands"
2.4,"Shami to Warner, FOUR runs","nails it this time. Short and at off again, but this time Warner's compressed his knees a little more to adjust for the lower bounce. Slaps it viciously, wide of mid-on"
2.3,"Shami to Warner, no run",beaten on the inside edge. Short and angled in at off stump. He looks to swipe with the angle and a flat bat
2.2,"Shami to Bairstow, 1 run","short and just outside off, shuffles and tucks this to mid-on's right"
2.1,"Shami to Warner, 1 run",short of a length and cramped him at middle stump. Mistimed punch to mid-off
1.6,"Mujeeb to Bairstow, no run","good length and floated in at off stump, blocked on the front foot"
1.5,"Mujeeb to Warner, 1 run","full and into middle stump, driven to long-on"
1.4,"Mujeeb to Bairstow, 1 run","full and into the pads, clipped to deep backward square"
1.3,"Mujeeb to Bairstow, no run","low full toss outside off again, but the attempted drive is mistimed towards mid-off this time"
1.2,"Mujeeb to Bairstow, FOUR runs","low full toss just outside off, holds his shape and taps this wide of extra cover"
1.1,"Mujeeb to Bairstow, no run",good length and slanted into off stump. Blocked into the off side
0.6,"Cottrell to Warner, FOUR runs","steered past slip. Good length ball outside off, in the corridor, and straightening a touch. He nudges this from inside the line. Whether he was looking for four our not, he finds the third man region with a boundary"
0.5,"Cottrell to Warner, FOUR runs",straight this time and just short of the boundary. Another good length delivery with some marginal movement away. Half a stride this time and a deliberate attempt to loft this straight and aerially
0.4,"Cottrell to Warner, no run",beaten. Short of a good length and swung away outside off. He looks to go with the front foot pull but that moves away too much
0.4,"Cottrell to Warner, 5 wide","short ball is too short. Even for the keeper. Leaps up with his right hand and can't get to that, Prabsimran"
0.3,"Cottrell to Warner, no run","good length and just outside off, defended solidly on the front foot"
0.2,"Cottrell to Warner, no run","short of a good length, curve away in the corridor. Defended off the back foot"
0.1,"Cottrell to Warner, no run","good length and wide outswinger outside off, punched into the covers firmly"
19.6,"Russell to Jadeja, FOUR runs","and Jadeja in typical CSK style ends the last over with three straight boundaries, driving this low full toss past extra cover. Long after the game is over as a contest"
19.5,"Russell to Jadeja, FOUR runs","another bouncer, hooked away with eyes off. Manages to get a four to deep square leg. NRR boost for CSK. CSK and NRR, tell me of a better love story"
19.4,"Russell to Jadeja, SIX runs","lovely shot from Jadeja to upper-cut this short ball over point for a six. As with many of the CSK guns this year, he has fired too late"
19.3,"Russell to Jadhav, 1 run","yorker outside off, dug out for one"
19.2,"Russell to Jadhav, no run","quick sharp bouncer at 140ks, nearly into the helmet. Another dot"
19.1,"Russell to Jadhav, no run","yorker now, on off, slight swing away too. Pushed to cover"
18.6,"Narine to Jadeja, no run","fires this one into the pads at 109ks. Jadeja is beaten on the slog. Narine shows why everyone was clamouring for him to bowl. Opened up the game with Watson's wicket, and has left CSK no chance to win"
18.5,"Narine to Jadeja, FOUR runs","into the pitch again, but it just sits up for too long. Wide outside off, Jadeja has to reach out for it, and thick edge flies over short third man and point for four"
18.4,"Narine to Jadhav, 1 run","looks to slog a full ball, but manages just a single to deep square leg"
18.3,"Narine to Jadhav, no run","quick, wide, short of a length, Jadhav looks to cut, but is hit on the inside half of the bat"
18.2,"Narine to Jadhav, FOUR runs","looks like the carrom ball, but is too short, and Jadhav just sits back and pulls this wide of long-on for four"
18.1,"Narine to Jadeja, 1 run","sees Jadeja coming, slips one wide outside off, and Jadeja does well to get some bat on it and save himself from a stumping"
17.6,"Russell to Jadeja, 1 run","Jadeja clears the front leg to slog, but Russell gives him nothing. Heavy ball, at his armpit again. No power in the shot. Just the single to long-on"
17.5,"Russell to Jadhav, 1 run","short of a length, at him, dropped to leg for one"
17.4,"Russell to Jadhav, no run","another short ball, this might be one for the over as it sails over Jadhav's pull"
17.3,"Russell to Jadhav, no run","there is some gas in this short ball. Cross-seam, just outside off, and flies over Jadhav's pull"
17.2,"Russell to Jadeja, 1 run","again that heavy ball. Short of a length, into the armpit, and Jadeja fends at it with eyes off the ball. Gets a single to long leg"
17.1,"Russell to Sam Curran, OUT","can he ever? Can he ever? Back of a length, no room, Curran wants to go over mid-off, but ends up hitting him straight to extra cover"
16.6,"Varun to Jadhav, no run","goes back to look to use his pace, but places this straight to short third man"
16.5,"Varun to Jadhav, no run","nice dipping offbreak, on a length, turning in from around off. Another block"
16.4,"Varun to Jadhav, no run","full, slow, outside off, defended to cover"
16.3,"Varun to Dhoni, OUT","and hello, the youngster has taken Dhoni down. He sticks to his guns. Flights up a length-ball legcutter. Dhoni opens up the front leg to slog-sweep him, but the ball doesn't turn away. Just goes on with the angle to knock back the middle stump"
16.2,"Varun to Dhoni, FOUR runs","short, wide and that is the freedom Dhoni needs. He might be getting on a little, but this is some brute force. Cut in front of point for four"
16.1,"Varun to Sam Curran, 1 run","offbreak, on a length, pushed to extra cover for one"
15.6,"Narine to Sam Curran, 1 run","on a length, carrom ball, punched to deep square leg for one"
15.5,"Narine to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","is this the over that breaks the game open? Lovely shot. Narine a touch too full, and Curran drives him over extra cover. This is excellent"
15.4,"Narine to Sam Curran, SIX runs",Curran provides CSK and Dhoni some relief. What a player he is proving to be. Down the wicket against Narine - a rare sight - and gets to the pitch of the ball and lofts him over long-off
15.3,"Narine to Dhoni, 1 run","oh he tries the big slog. That is very unDhoni-like. The offbreak dips alarmingly, and then takes the thick inside edge into his front pad"
15.2,"Narine to Sam Curran, 1 run","offbreak, short of a length, pulled to deep midwicket"
15.1,"Narine to Dhoni, 1 leg bye","straight offbreak, turning down leg, Dhoni happy with a leg-bye"
14.6,"Varun to Dhoni, 1 run","full and slow, drilled down to long-on for one"
14.5,"Varun to Dhoni, 2 runs","quick length ball, Dhoni rocks back to use his pace, and cuts this. Except that he has cut it in front of point. He beats him to the other side, and gets four. This time, he gets two"
14.4,"Varun to Dhoni, 2 runs","electric save from Tripathi at deep backwards square leg. Dhoni has pulled this powerfully behind square, but Tripathi puts in a full-length dive to keep this in"
14.3,"Varun to Dhoni, no run","seems like the carrom ball. Dhoni goes back to cut, but can't beat point"
14.2,"Varun to Sam Curran, 1 run","length ball, offbreak, goes back to punch this down the ground"
14.1,"Varun to Sam Curran, no run","offbreak, runs off the leading edge to point"
13.6,"Narine to Dhoni, no run","short cover again, another dot. Dhoni yet to hit a boundary off Narine ever"
13.5,"Narine to Dhoni, no run","short of a length, no room, Dhoni pushes this to short cover"
13.4,"Narine to Sam Curran, 1 run","offbreak, on a length, draws him forward, pushed to long-off for one"
13.3,"Narine to Sam Curran, 2 runs","similar delivery, and this time he places this past short midwicket. And no Watson means they convert this into a couple"
13.2,"Narine to Sam Curran, no run","short of a length, pitched outside leg, punched to short midwicket"
13.1,"Narine to Watson, OUT","He has given him. Seems going down leg to me. They go upstairs. Beaten in flight completely. He is trying to pull a ball this is just short of a length, and also skids through. It pitches on off, doesn't turn much, and is this is a carrom ball? It is a front-of-the-hand ball for sure. So it sort of holds its line against the angle, and that means it is clipping leg. Huge wicket. Make that nine dismissals for around 90 runs for Narine v Watson"
12.6,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, 1 run","on a length, straight, worked to deep midwicket. That is fifty for Watson"
12.5,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, no run","full, just outside off, driven back at him, and he does well to field in his follow-through"
12.4,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, no run","short of a length, stump tp stump, and played back to Nagarkoti"
12.3,"Nagarkoti, to Dhoni, 1 run","interesting. Dhoni plays a big shot so early into the innings. No feet, and he gets a think outside edge to a length ball. Single to third man"
12.2,"Nagarkoti, to Dhoni, no run","short of a length, Dhoni across and early into the pull. Hit on the box"
12.1,"Nagarkoti, to Rayudu, OUT","wow the bowling change works. What do I know about cricket? Rayudu has found long-on with pinpoint precision. Short of a length, not much remarkable about the delivery except that Rayudu decided to pull in the air. Long-on says thank you very much"
11.6,"Narine to Rayudu, 1 run","drags this short, and Rayudu is quick to rock back and pull it to deep square for on"
11.5,"Narine to Watson, 1 run","offbreak, on a length, around off, punched down to long-on for one"
11.4,"Narine to Rayudu, 1 run","carrom ball, short of a length, outside off, cut away to deep point"
11.3,"Narine to Rayudu, no run","nice offbreak, dipping, just outside off, hit back to him"
11.2,"Narine to Rayudu, 2 runs","down the wicket, flat offbreak, hit past midwicket, and Russell makes a diving save at the fence"
11.1,"Narine to Rayudu, no run","offbreak, sits up, nearly hit back for a return catch. Falls short"
10.6,"Cummins to Watson, no run","short of a length, on off, pushed to point"
10.6,"Cummins to Watson, 1 wide","bouncer, too high according to the square leg umpire. Called wide"
10.5,"Cummins to Rayudu, 1 run","full and wide, hit wide of mid-off for one"
10.4,"Cummins to Watson, 1 run","short of a length, around off, pushed wide of cover for one"
10.3,"Cummins to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length, Rayudu gets inside the line to nudge this to leg"
10.2,"Cummins to Rayudu, no run","short of a length, outside off, punched to cover"
10.1,"Cummins to Rayudu, no run","on a length, on off, slight movement back in. Defended"
9.6,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, FOUR runs",and this time Watson makes room to clear the ring on the off side. And that is the sparsely populated side of the field. Smart batting again. Just chipping it over the infield
9.5,"Nagarkoti, to Rayudu, 1 run","down the wicket, yorks himself a little, gets a single to leg"
9.4,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, 1 run","nearly a yorker, dug out for a single to long-on"
9.3,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, FOUR runs","one more that falls short. Mavi at deep midwicket runs to his right but doesn't take one step forward, and this Watson pull yorks him. Another misjudgement in the deep"
9.2,"Nagarkoti, to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length, quite straight, Rayudu gets inside the line to bunt this pull for a single"
9.1,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, 1 run","length ball, pushed to mid-off for a quick single"
8.6,"Varun to Watson, 1 run",pulled away to deep backward square for one more
8.5,"Varun to Rayudu, 1 run","slower through the air, Rayudu goes back to push this length ball into the covers for one"
8.4,"Varun to Watson, 1 run","short, Watson hurried into the pull, gets a single to deep midwicket"
8.3,"Varun to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length, straight, punched to deep midwicket"
8.2,"Varun to Watson, 1 run","the big heave-ho, gets a thick inside edge to deep midwicket for one"
8.1,"Varun to Watson, FOUR runs","smart batting. Down on a knee early, gets across, and laps this from outside off, fine of fine leg, who is square"
7.6,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, 1 run",pulled away to deep square for one
7.5,"Nagarkoti, to Rayudu, 1 run","leading edge, flies wide of Rana at point. On a length, Rayudu shuffles across again, it holds its line, and the leading edge doesn't go to hand"
7.4,"Nagarkoti, to Rayudu, no run","on a length, he shuffles across to get behind the line, and pushes it back to Nagarkoti"
7.3,"Nagarkoti, to Rayudu, FOUR runs","down the wicket, stays inside the line, and goes inside-out to what he has turned into a length ball. Lovely shot"
7.2,"Nagarkoti, to Rayudu, no run","full, on off, driven, but the extra cover is in tight to keep this to a dot"
7.1,"Nagarkoti, to Watson, 1 run","on a length, outside off, dabs on it for a single to third man"
6.6,"Varun to Rayudu, FOUR runs","back of a length, Rayudu goes deep into the crease, and rubs salt into the wounds by pulling this for four through deep midwicket"
6.5,"Varun to Watson, 1 run","nearly picks out the deep fielder. KKR will be questioning if Tripathi shouldn't have attacked this. Watson pulls hard and flat, straight towards Tripathi at deep square, who doesn't step in and watches it land on a half-volley. I count it as a misjudgement and a drop"
6.4,"Varun to Rayudu, 1 run","offbreak, goes back to push this to leg for one"
6.3,"Varun to Watson, 1 run","a touch too short, pulled away, but straight to deep square leg"
6.2,"Varun to Watson, no run","stays short of a length, punched to extra cover"
6.1,"Varun to Rayudu, 1 run","carrom ball first up. Short of a length, punched down to long-on"
5.6,"Shivam Mavi to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, dropped at his feet virtually. A single taken easily"
5.5,"Shivam Mavi to Watson, 1 run","short of a length again, cut away to third man for one"
5.4,"Shivam Mavi to Watson, no run","short of a length, straight, pushed to midwicket"
5.3,"Shivam Mavi to Watson, SIX runs","Watson taking full toll of the youngster here. Don't go by that wicket last over, Mavi has been pretty ordinary this spell. Nice little short ball for Watson to pull over square leg for six"
5.2,"Shivam Mavi to Watson, FOUR runs","Watson back away, Mavi tries to follow him with a shortish ball, but that plays into the batsman's hand if your fine leg is up. Watson is adept enoogh to place this wide of that fielder"
5.1,"Shivam Mavi to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length, straight, tucked off the hip for one"
4.6,"Cummins to Rayudu, 1 run","shout for lbw. Swings back in off a length, seems to have hit him in front, but it is bouncing over"
4.5,"Cummins to Watson, 1 run","sort ball, cramps him up, but he pulls it square of deep square"
4.4,"Cummins to Rayudu, 1 run","full and straight, pushed to mid-on for one"
4.3,"Cummins to Rayudu, FOUR runs","lucky runs. Short of a lenngth, just outside off, holds its line, takes the outside edge, and Rayudu's soft hands make sure it doesn't fly. Wide of slip it goes"
4.3,"Cummins to Rayudu, 1 wide","bouncer, down the leg side, and called wide"
4.2,"Cummins to Watson, 1 run","full and straight, mis-hit to mid-on, where Narine misfields to allow them a single"
4.1,"Cummins to Watson, no run","nearly run out. On a length, on off, played with an open face to point. Rayudu sends him back, and it is his call. Nagarkoti misses with the throw"
3.6,"Shivam Mavi to Watson, 1 run","short of a length, at him, pulled to deep square for one"
3.5,"Shivam Mavi to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, worked to leg for one"
3.4,"Shivam Mavi to du Plessis, OUT","big big wicket. Mavi persisted with despite match-ups calling for Narine. And I don't think Mavi has done anything differently here. This is just one of those T20 things. You bowl the same delivery, and the batsmen plays vastly different shots. Mavi stays short of a length, widish, and du Plessis gives him too much room this time, and edges through to Karthik"
3.3,"Shivam Mavi to Watson, 1 run","on a length, straight, dropped to cover for one"
3.2,"Shivam Mavi to Watson, FOUR runs","smart shot. Short of a length, slight width, with third man up. And Watson uses all his pace to guide him past that short third man"
3.1,"Shivam Mavi to Watson, no run","length ball, stump to stump, Watson is watchful"
2.6,"Cummins to du Plessis, no run","quicker, short of a length, hits him on the thigh pad with movement back in"
2.5,"Cummins to du Plessis, FOUR runs","draws the short ball with the lovely push to a length ball last ball. And he is seeing this beautifully. Picks the length early, sets up for the pull, and smacks it through midwicket"
2.4,"Cummins to du Plessis, 2 runs","lovely shot. This is a decent inswinger, honing in on top of off. Du Plessis stays inside its line, and pushes with an open face, placing it wide of extra cover for two"
2.3,"Cummins to Watson, 1 leg bye","swinging in again, but down leg, so they get a leg-bye"
2.2,"Cummins to Watson, no run","on a length again, swinging back in, no room, defended"
2.1,"Cummins to Watson, no run","perfect length. On off, aiming at the top of off. Defended"
1.6,"Shivam Mavi to du Plessis, FOUR runs","masterly batting by du Plessis. Moving around the crease to hit a young bowler off his plans. Shuffles across, then makes room, and whips a straight short-of-a-length ball through square leg for four"
1.5,"Shivam Mavi to du Plessis, FOUR runs","shuffles across and deep, gets under a shortish ball, and goes over wide mid-off. Not absolutely cleanly struck but gets enough to clear the infield"
1.4,"Shivam Mavi to Watson, 1 run","short of a length again, single to deep midwicket"
1.3,"Shivam Mavi to du Plessis, 1 run","stays short of a length, just around off, punched wide of mid-off for one again"
1.2,"Shivam Mavi to Watson, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, Watson goes back to run this down to third man for one"
1.1,"Shivam Mavi to du Plessis, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched wide of mid-off for one"
0.6,"Cummins to Watson, FOUR runs","lovely drive. Just a touch too full, and Watson likes to get a stride in. Drives this through extra cover for four"
0.5,"Cummins to du Plessis, 1 run","short of a length, gets big on him, he drops it down to point for a single"
0.4,"Cummins to du Plessis, no run","lovely delivery. Pitches on a length, on off, nips back in, hits him on the pad, but the umpire rules it is doing too much. And rightly so"
0.3,"Cummins to Watson, 1 run","this is the outswinger, around off, on a length, off the thick edge it runs to third man"
0.2,"Cummins to Watson, no run","full, slight shape in, hits the inside half of the bat on the drive"
0.1,"Cummins to Watson, no run","short of a length, on off, good carry as it is left alone"
19.6,"Bravo to Varun, 1 run, OUT","low full toss, hits into the leg side, and they will risk the second. And magically, Dhoni has out that big glove back on by the time he reaches the wicket to collect the throw. And collect the throw he does to run him out"
19.5,"Bravo to Shivam Mavi, OUT","and that glove off nearly brings a drop. Mavi gets a big edge to a wide slower ball, the edge flies to Dhoni's right, who sticks out the ungloved hand, and the ball lobs off away towards short third man. Dhoni runs off, puts a dive in, and takes the rebound"
19.4,"Bravo to Cummins, 1 run","low full toss, can't get under it, hit straight to long-off for one"
19.3,"Bravo to Cummins, 2 runs","on-pace length ball, Cummins slogs, gets two off the inside half of the bat"
19.2,"Bravo to Nagarkoti,, OUT","slower ball now, and Nagarkoti mis-times this to mid-off for a catch. At least that bring Cummins to the strike"
19.2,"Bravo to Nagarkoti,, 1 wide",sharp bouncer. You know young kid will be under pressure after one early dot. Now it is two as he slips a quick bouncer in and beats him. Oh this is too high. Called a wide
19.1,"Bravo to Nagarkoti,, no run","he backs away, then shuffles across, looking for the ramp, but is beaten by an on-pace length ball. The idea is not bad, but the execution is"
18.6,"Sam Curran to Karthik, OUT","wide, short of a length, Karthik tries to go for the upper-cut, but the lack of pace means he can't time it well. Caught at square third man by Thakur, but not on the first attempt"
18.5,"Sam Curran to Karthik, FOUR runs","dropped by Jadeja. How rare is that event? Karthik shuffles wide again, and sweeps this flat towards deep midwicket. High to the right of Jadeja it goes, who gets both hands to it, but it slips out and rolls on for four"
18.4,"Sam Curran to Karthik, no run","full and wide, really wide, but not called as Karthik has shuffled across early"
18.3,"Sam Curran to Cummins, 1 run","full and wide, with the third man back and also a short third man in. This one goes to the man in the deep. For a single"
18.2,"Sam Curran to Cummins, 2 runs","lovely drive on the up, looks to beat extra cover, but Bravo puts in a dive and gets a hand on it. They still get two"
18.1,"Sam Curran to Karthik, 1 run","looks to shuffle and ramp, but Curran bowls the slower one and concedes just the one leg-bye"
17.6,"Thakur to Cummins, SIX runs","Cummins providing this innings the final twist? Gets under a short-of-a-length ball, and effortlessly swings it over wide long-on for six. Excellent timing"
17.5,"Thakur to Cummins, no run","slower ball. Not sure it is a knuckle ball or not, but it beats Cummins outside off. Thakur appeals for a catch at the wicket, Dhoni doesn't support him. Also not a slower ball. Just bowled cross-seam, and it sits in the surface"
17.4,"Thakur to Cummins, FOUR runs","out of the screws. Short ball, not too high, and Cummins pull this over midwicket for four"
17.4,"Thakur to Cummins, 1 wide",wide down the leg side
17.3,"Thakur to Karthik, 1 run","bouncer, on off, pulled to deep square leg for one"
17.2,"Thakur to Cummins, 1 run","short of a length, just outside off, runs off the outside edge for a single to third man"
17.1,"Thakur to Karthik, 1 run","full and straight, driven to long-on for one"
16.6,"Bravo to Cummins, no run","wide full toss, and another fumble by Jagadeesan at extra cover. No run, though"
16.5,"Bravo to Tripathi, OUT","catch or a bump ball?. It is a near yorker steered straight to short third man. We go to the third man. The soft signal is out. It bounces short of the bat, and goes off the toe end for a clean catch to short third man. A fair effort by Tripathi, who did his usual Powerplay slogging before selflessly hitting out post PP. Not his fault that Morgan and Russell got out at the other end"
16.4,"Bravo to Tripathi, 2 runs","hit hard on the up and straight to extra cover, but a misfield there gives them two runs"
16.3,"Bravo to Tripathi, FOUR runs","short and wide, and Tripathi upper-cuts it away over point. Wide of square third man too"
16.2,"Bravo to Karthik, 1 run","short of a length, on-pace, into the body, worked off the hip for one"
16.1,"Bravo to Karthik, no run","short of a length, no room, slight cut back in, hits him high on the pad"
15.6,"Thakur to Karthik, 1 run","short ball, hurries him up, pulled down to long leg for one"
15.5,"Thakur to Tripathi, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, opens the face for a single to third man"
15.4,"Thakur to Karthik, 1 run","wide length ball, pushed with an open face to deep cover"
15.3,"Thakur to Karthik, 2 runs","on a length again, on off, pushed wide of long-on for two"
15.2,"Thakur to Russell, OUT","huge wicket. Russell clears the front leg to slog to leg, but Thakur has been superb. Unerring with his length. Short of a length, cross-seam, lands on the seam, bounces, and takes the top edge through to Dhoni"

14.5,"Chahar to Tripathi, 1 run","short of a length, not much room, punched down to long-off for one"
14.4,"Chahar to Tripathi, SIX runs",this is just poor bowling. A gentle length ball well down the leg side with the fine leg up. Tripathi laps it up with a sweep over short fine leg
14.3,"Chahar to Russell, 1 run","on a length, straight, pushed to long-on for one"
14.2,"Chahar to Tripathi, 1 run","short of a length, wide, punched to deep cover for one"
14.1,"Chahar to Tripathi, FOUR runs","oh he gets a gift from the returning Chahar. Well down the leg side with fine leg up, and he helps it over short fine. That will find him breathing space"
13.6,"Sam Curran to Morgan, OUT",and there is a wicket at the wrong end. It is Tripathi who should be getting out from KKR's point of view. Instead it is Morgan gone off a really good sharp bouncer. It is angled into the body and over his right shoulder and takes the glove on the way through to Dhoni
13.5,"Sam Curran to Tripathi, 1 run","slower short ball, Tripathi is swinging hard but he is finding neither the fence nor the fielders. That is a good result for CSK. Just the single to long-on"
13.4,"Sam Curran to Tripathi, no run","quicker ball, hits him on the thigh pad as Tripathi attempts another big hit into the leg side"
13.3,"Sam Curran to Tripathi, 2 runs","slower ball, outside leg, Tripathi looks to sweep this behind square but the slowness means he ends up hitting it in front of square. Still gets two as Chahar loses the ball in the air and doesn't attack it"
13.2,"Sam Curran to Morgan, 1 run","on a length, angling in, punched down to long-on for one"
13.1,"Sam Curran to Tripathi, 1 run","another run-out missed. Curran cramps him up, Tripathi plays this to Curran's right and runs off. Curran misses with Tripathi miles out of the crease"
12.6,"Karn to Morgan, no run","nice legbreak, middle and leg, turning back in to crap him up. Hits his pad"
12.5,"Karn to Tripathi, 1 run","stays away from the Tripathi slog by shortening the length. Bottom edge for one to covershailesh: ""In middle over, 20 runs in 10 balls don't make much sense. I would rather have a proper batsman, who can hit in the end and will cover-up. Losing wickets surely slow down things and we shouldn't underestimate the power of set batsman."""
12.4,"Karn to Morgan, 1 run",makes room to dab this length ball to point for one
12.3,"Karn to Tripathi, 1 run","wide length ball, driven hard, but the deep cover is straight to keep this kind of a drive down to one"
12.2,"Karn to Tripathi, no run","sees him look to come down, slips a wide quick legbreak to beat him. Tripathi does well to keep his back foot in the crease"

11.2,"Thakur to Morgan, no run","on a length, just a touch straighter, pushed to cover this time"
11.1,"Thakur to Morgan, FOUR runs",oh is he in good touch or what? Just laces a cover-drive first ball square of extra cover and straight of deep cover. Just a lovely little push to a length ball
10.6,"Karn to Narine, OUT","Jadeja and du Plessis combine for a superb catch. Narine continues with his job of slogging these middle overs. He seems to have placed this between long-on and deep midwicket, but Jadeja makes the ground to his right and makes the dive to catch it. He doesn't quite need to do it, but he relays the catch to du Plessis because the boundary skirting is not too far from him"
10.5,"Karn to Tripathi, 1 run","slow wide legbreak, slogged across the line, but gets a bottom edge for one to long-on"
10.4,"Karn to Narine, 1 run","Triphti turns down the second. This has been placed wide of deep square, but he doesn't go for the second"

10.2,"Karn to Narine, 1 run","full, into the pads, worked into the leg side for what looks like a couple but Narine slips while turning around"
10.1,"Karn to Tripathi, 1 run","Tripathi will not hold back, which is how he should play instead of setting himself up for a personal landmark. He knows he is not close enough to this full ball so chips this right back over his head for a single"
9.6,"Bravo to Narine, 2 runs","on a length, into the pads, placed between deep midwicket and deep square for two"
9.5,"Bravo to Narine, FOUR runs","and now he plays with the field. Full, nearly a yorker, outside off, squeezed between short third and point"
9.4,"Bravo to Narine, SIX runs","Narine showing he can hit with the field spread too. And that too to a slower ball. Offcutter, outside off, on a length, and he goes over long-off. Nailed beautifully"

9.3,"Bravo to Tripathi, 1 run","slower ball, full, driven hard to long-on for one"

8.4,"Karn to Narine, 1 run","on a length, on the pads, nudged to short fine leg for one"
8.3,"Karn to Tripathi, 1 run",Tripathi keeps going. Flat slog sweep to deep midwicket for one
8.2,"Karn to Tripathi, no run","quick legbreak, no turn, kept out by Tripathi"
8.1,"Karn to Rana, OUT","big slog-sweep, but it hangs in the air for a catch at long-on. Just not full enough even though Rana is going with the turn. Just not close enough to the pitch of the ball to nail this"

6.5,"Karn to Tripathi, 2 runs","half-volley, on off, driven hard past extra cover for two"
6.4,"Karn to Tripathi, SIX runs",Tripathi continues slogging. That is so good to see. And good intentions bring good results. He has slogged this full all the way over the leaping Curran at long-on
6.3,"Karn to Rana, 1 run","full, on off, driven to long-on for another single"
6.2,"Karn to Tripathi, 1 run","short of a length, into the pads, punched down to long-on"

5.5,"Chahar to Tripathi, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, short-arm jab to deep square leg for one"
5.5,"Chahar to Tripathi, 1 wide","short offcutter, spinning down the leg side. He is lucky Tripathi has got no bat on it as the fine leg is up"

5.2,"Chahar to Tripathi, 1 run","this one moves in, worked away to short fine leg for one"
5.1,"Chahar to Tripathi, no run","looks like a legcutter. At 130ks. On a length, opens him up a little with away movement. Defended back to him"

4.3,"Thakur to Rana, no run","short of a length, no room, defended from the crease"
4.2,"Thakur to Gill, OUT","Thakur gets Gill a third time in three innings. Looks to slog at a length ball while he has been picking the singles so well till now. Perhaps just saw a length ball and went after it, which is fair enough. Thakur has bowled it cross-seam, and it seems to have hit the smooth leather and skidded on, taking the bottom edge"
4.2,"Thakur to Gill, 1 wide","slower ball, wide down the leg side"
4.1,"Thakur to Gill, no run","short of a length, outside off, and he has hit this too well to be taking a single to mid-off"
3.6,"Sam Curran to Tripathi, FOUR runs","Tripathi is loving this promotion. The fields are up, and he is swinging selflessly at the ball. Clears mid-off this time"
3.5,"Sam Curran to Tripathi, no run",misses out on a full toss outside off. Ends up swinging inside its line

3.1,"Sam Curran to Gill, 1 run","offcutter, on a length, around off, dropped into the covers for one"
2.6,"Chahar to Tripathi, FOUR runs","short ball, angling into him, with short fine leg up, and Tripathi knows he doesn't need to nail the hook. He just helps it along over the fielder's head"
2.5,"Chahar to Tripathi, FOUR runs",and Tripathi now slogs. That is what made him a good opener for RPS. Selfless slogging. Gets enough on this length ball to clear the infield. Thakur gives it chase and puts in a big dive but the third umpire rules he is in touch with the ball when his knee makes contact with the rope
2.4,"Chahar to Gill, 1 run","on a length, wicket to wicket, pushed to mid-on for one"
2.3,"Chahar to Gill, FOUR runs","short at gentle pace, and pulled away over midwicket for four"
2.2,"Chahar to Tripathi, 1 run","Jadeja misses again. This time at the non-striker's. Again he gets a good bounce, and again Tripathi is short. He has started off the back foot, and has had to run around Chahar, but he is lucky again. Jadeja doesn't usually miss two out of two"
2.1,"Chahar to Gill, 1 run","inswinger, strays to leg, clipped away for one"
1.6,"Sam Curran to Gill, 1 run","Jadeja misses. He is tight at point, gets a good bounce, and the batsmen have absent-mindedly set off for a single. In the end, Tripathi is left to put in a dive, which is not enough if Jadeja hits. On this rare occasion, Jadeja misses"

1.2,"Sam Curran to Gill, 1 run","on a length, outside off, pushed to mid-off for one"
1.1,"Sam Curran to Gill, no run","Curran is very lucky here. Bowls a plum half-volley, Gill plays a lovely straight drive, but just too straight and into the wicket at the non-striker's end. The ricochet goes straight to mid-off"

0.1,"Chahar to Tripathi, 1 wide",big wide down the leg side. He goes slightly round arm with this
18.1,"Pattinson to Rajpoot, OUT","taken at extra cover. Short of a length, just outside off, looks to slash that into the off side and it comes off the high part of the bat and floats up for Rohit who leaps and holds on easily"
17.6,"Bumrah to Archer, OUT","straight to Pollard at long-on. Low full toss at the stumps, mistimes the slog, Pollard takes it without having to move. Best figures of the season for a bowler. It's also his first four-for in T20s"
17.5,"Bumrah to Archer, FOUR runs","swatted wide of long-on again! Short ball at off, drags it with a pull right off the middle"
17.4,"Bumrah to Archer, 2 runs","bouncer at off stump, takes his eyes off that and swats it to deep midwicket's right"
17.3,"Bumrah to Archer, FOUR runs","low full toss on leg stump, stands tall and whips that to long-on's right"

15.6,"Bumrah to Rajpoot, no run","yorker at leg stump, stabbed out to mid-on"
15.5,"Bumrah to Gopal, OUT","taken behind. That rose up at Gopal, and then it rose up at QDK too. Some fire in that delivery. Short of a length, just outside off. Looks to stab it down to third man and gets the outside edge. QDK is let's say woken up by that one, to his right"
15.4,"Bumrah to Archer, 1 run","yorker at off stump, pushed to sweeper cover"
15.3,"Bumrah to Gopal, 1 run","short and just outside off, runs it to third man's right"
15.2,"Bumrah to Tewatia, OUT","nails another yorker and that's deflected onto the stumps off his back leg. Got the front leg out of the way and tried to whip it leg side, but that was too good for him"
15.1,"Bumrah to Tewatia, no run","yorker at middle stump, squeezed out to midwicket"
14.6,"Pollard to Archer, FOUR runs","swatted to long-off's right, first ball. Slower ball, short and wide outside off, Back leg well into the off side as he lines this up and brings a hammer at it. Flat and one bounce over the line"
14.5,"Pollard to Tewatia, 1 run","slower ball outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
14.4,"Pollard to Tom Curran, OUT","taken for deep midwicket. Slower short ball just outside off, can't clear the ground with his attempted lofted pull. Midiwcket jogs to the left to take that"

14.2,"Pollard to Tom Curran, no run","slower short ball, he's beaten on the pull and can't believe that's not a wide"
14.1,"Pollard to Tom Curran, FOUR runs","full and wide outside off, sliced over point. Was looking to go straighter than that but it's enough"
13.6,"Pattinson to Tewatia, FOUR runs","oh smoothly lofted over mid-off. Overpitched and wide outside off, just goes with the angle, uses the pace, and connects perfectly on this drive"
13.5,"Pattinson to Tewatia, no run","short and just outside off, mistimed cut to extra cover"
13.4,"Pattinson to Tewatia, no run",bouncer gets too big for him to get that upper cut away
13.3,"Pattinson to Buttler, OUT","sensational Pollard! Seems to give us one of these every year. Full and in at leg stump, lines it up and wants to club that over long-on. Makes decent connection, but little elevation on that. Well, too little when it's Pollard anyway. A couple of strides to his left,  and then he jumps up and reaches for that with his right palm. The ball clatters into his forearm, it appears, and threatens to drop to the ground. But after all that he's done up to that point, he's still alive to it and recovers to get his hands in position and hold on low to his left. A special catch to end a special innings. Grins sheepishly at his dugout behind him"
13.2,"Pattinson to Tom Curran, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
13.1,"Pattinson to Tom Curran, no run","short of a good length outside off, gets down for the ramp, improvises for the reverse-ramp and misses completely. QDK leaps to his right to stop that"

11.2,"Krunal to Buttler, 1 run","fires the yorker in at leg stump, jammed down to long-on"
11.1,"Krunal to Buttler, SIX runs","is this on? Buttler is, for sure. Short of a good length, angled into him as he walks into the leg side, and he uses the angle to swipe yet another one over the leg side. 87 metres in the direction of midwicket"

10.5,"Chahar to Buttler, SIX runs",sends it over long-on! That's fifty. Singlehandedly keeping them alive tonight. Chahar goes diagonal run-up again and loses his bearings. Drops this wayyyyy too short outside off and it's a clean swing with the pull

10.3,"Chahar to Buttler, 1 run","short and wide outside off, laced on the up to sweeper"
10.2,"Chahar to Tom Curran, 1 run","length outside off, chopped to sweeper cover"
10.2,"Chahar to Tom Curran, 1 wide","would have been a brilliant stumping but Curran survives. Short ball down leg side as he spots Chahar jumping down the pitch. QDK does brilliantly to pluck this down leg side and then try and flick it onto the stumps, but he misses"
10.1,"Chahar to Tom Curran, no run",good length and pushed through at leg stump. Tapped back down the pitch
9.6,"Krunal to Buttler, no run","full and in at middle, driven to extra cover"
9.5,"Krunal to Buttler, SIX runs",slapped over the extra cover boundary. It's short and it's low and wide outside off. But there's a lot of time. He puts the front leg out and slaps it with the turn

8.2,"Chahar to Buttler, SIX runs","see ya. Dropped short, outside off, sitting right up and he pummels this over midwicket with a pull"
8.1,"Chahar to Lomror, OUT","incredible catch running backwards from extra cover! Looks like Anukul Roy, a sub. Full ball outside off, looks to heave leg side, gets a leading edge that's headed towards landing just past where mid-off might've been. He sprints backwards and to his left and pull out a full-length dive to hold on to that. Brilliant"
7.6,"Pattinson to Lomror, 1 leg bye","a plea for lbw from Pattinson! That pitched outside leg, surely? He's over the wicket. Lomror shuffles and catches this in front of middle as he looks for the glance. Rohit not convinced on the review"

5.3,"Pattinson to Lomror, no run","good length and just outside off, defended into the covers"

3.3,"Bumrah to Buttler, no run",how'd that miss off stump! Oh boy. That was a yorker angled and was continuing to move in with that angle. Buttler was looking to carve through the covers

1.6,"Bumrah to Samson, no run",appeal for catch behind as Bumrah cuts through him. Mumbai don't review the not-out decisions. Short of a good length and cramping him at the thigh. It's gone through to the keeper off the thigh guard
1.5,"Bumrah to Samson, no run","short of a length in the corridor, defended into the covers"
1.4,"Bumrah to Smith, OUT","taken low to the left by the keeper. Smith's inexplicable powerplay batting decisions continue. It's astounding how he's thrown it away the last three matches. This is a good length ball outside off, slanted into him. He's had a big big swipe across the line without moving his feet and the inside edge is taken. A wild swipe and he nearly fell into the off side at the end of that"
1.3,"Bumrah to Buttler, 1 run","good length and rising up at middle stump. He's off his feet trying to flick this, cops it on the thigh"
1.2,"Bumrah to Smith, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to mid-off's right"
1.1,"Bumrah to Smith, no run","good length and angled into the corridor, shuffles and flicks straight to square leg"
0.6,"Boult to Smith, 1 run","good length and just outside off, dropped into the covers with soft hands"
0.5,"Boult to Smith, no run","full inswinger at off stump, driven to mid-off"
0.4,"Boult to Smith, FOUR runs","whipped away! Outrageous. Short ball outside off, drops his weight into the off side and uses his wrists to get this behind square"
0.3,"Boult to Smith, no run","good length and swung in at off stump, punched back at the bowler off the back foot"
0.2,"Boult to Jaiswal, OUT","not a successful return for Jaiswal. It's short of a good length, it's curving away from him outside off. He hangs leg side of it and has a swish at it. A thin edge taken comfortably"
0.1,"Boult to Jaiswal, no run","good length on middle stump, shuffles and tucks this to midwicket from the crease"
19.6,"Rajpoot to Pandya, 1 run","low full toss on middle stump, mistimed drive to long-on's right and Hardik slips at the other end so they can't come back for the second"
19.5,"Rajpoot to Pandya, SIX runs","mistimed and dragged over long-on. That's another friendly full toss from Rajpoot. Thigh height at off stump, he slices the attempted slow but that's enough"
19.4,"Rajpoot to Yadav, 1 run","slower full ball dipping outside off, swiped into midwicket region off the low part of the bat"
19.3,"Rajpoot to Yadav, FOUR runs","ramped over short fine again. Low full toss outside off, skips into the line and it's easy work for him from there"
19.2,"Rajpoot to Pandya, 1 run","in the slot and wide outside off, but he doesn't get close to that as his feet are rooted. Mistimed off the inside half to long-on"
19.2,"Rajpoot to Pandya, (no ball) 2 runs","yorker outside off, mistimed drive to long-off and that allows them the second. SKY comes back and puts in a dive too, in case the doctors are still looking at his coordination. The siren has gone off, by the way. He has overstepped"
19.1,"Rajpoot to Yadav, 1 run","low full toss outside off, looks to drill through the covers but it trickles into the leg side off the toe-end"
18.6,"Archer to Yadav, 1 run","short of a good length outside off, walks into the line again and swipes to fine leg's left"
18.5,"Archer to Yadav, SIX runs","oh wow! Wow. Unreal. The cojones on this guy. Walks into a bouncer head first, but is still looking for the boundary behind the wicket next ball. He squats as a full ball lands just outside off, and then opens the face to lift this over well, the first slip region. And it goes all the way"
18.4,"Archer to Yadav, no run","now SKY is hit on the helmet and looks out of sorts. It was a slower bouncer outside off and he walked into it. That hit him on the badge. And it rung immediately. He's on his feet. But seemed disoriented immediately. It was a knuckle ball and from Jofra, even that can do damage. But it looks like he's passed whatever test they were giving him. A nod to the doctors and the helmet is back on"
18.3,"Archer to Pandya, 1 run","full outside off, opens the face and sliced to sweeper cover"
18.2,"Archer to Pandya, no run","beaten. Slower ball at a good length, wide outside off, has a swish at that"
18.1,"Archer to Pandya, 2 runs","full and low at the stumps, drilled to long-on's left"
18.1,"Archer to Pandya, (no ball) 4 byes","oh well done getting out of the way. That. Was. Scary. Absolutely terrifying  - a beamer from Jofra headed straight for Hardik's head. He just manages to get under that. It was 152kph. It's got everyone, including Buttler. Snuck under him. Holds up his hands in apology"
17.6,"Tom Curran to Yadav, FOUR runs","and now he lifts it over short fine! Savvy batting, this. Expected a shorter length and was fed with a slower short ball outside off, much like the one he got from Jofra, last ball of the last over. Dropped his right shoulder and ramped this"
17.5,"Tom Curran to Yadav, SIX runs","whew, clean! Nice anticipation of the yorker and even better execution of the sweep. Low full outside off, he's down, nearly both knees on the floor and lifts it over square leg who was in the circle"
17.4,"Tom Curran to Pandya, 1 run",dropped. Curran foxes Hardik with a slower short ball outside off. He slices the attempted pull and it hangs up in the short midwicket area. Somehow Curran ends up getting too far ahead of this and is reaching backwards and to his right
17.3,"Tom Curran to Pandya, 2 runs","yorker nailed at middle stump, can't do more than jam this to deep midwicket"
17.2,"Tom Curran to Pandya, FOUR runs","just manages to beat sweeper to his right. Low full toss outside off, stands upright, opens the face and gets it over extra cover"
17.1,"Tom Curran to Pandya, 2 runs","low full toss just outside off, shuffled and drills to deep midwicket"
16.6,"Archer to Yadav, FOUR runs","and that's a reply and a half! SKY is elated with that. It's a knuckle ball, short and outside off. He backs into the leg side, stays more upright this time and manages to swipe that over short fine"
16.5,"Archer to Yadav, no run","quickly past his attempted ramp. That ball has a chuckle at SKY as he's down on one knee. It was short and sailed over him, outside off"
16.4,"Archer to Yadav, no run","yorker just outside off, exposes the stumps to try and carve that. Can only get it to backward point on the bounce. A 151.9kph yorker that one"
16.3,"Archer to Pandya, 1 run","short and cramping him up at middle, punched to long-on off the back foot"
16.2,"Archer to Pandya, no run",short of a good length and quick in the corridor. Hurriedly punched back to the bowler
16.1,"Archer to Pandya, FOUR runs","past mid-off. It's hard to tell if that was a miscued shot or just one he was looking to connect on, whichever direction. Slower ball, short of a good length outside off, it's a half-cut, half-punch off the back foot and it's between bowler and fielder"
15.6,"Tom Curran to Pandya, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, subdued pull out to deep midwicket's right"
15.5,"Tom Curran to Yadav, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, pulled to long-on"
15.4,"Tom Curran to Yadav, no run","half a run-out chance at the non-striker's. Good length outside off, punched to extra cover's left. Hardik sent back and might have made it even if Smith's throw was collected"
15.3,"Tom Curran to Pandya, 1 run","full on middle stump, drilled to long-on"
15.2,"Tom Curran to Yadav, 1 run","slower short ball at middle, pulled to deep square"
15.1,"Tom Curran to Yadav, FOUR runs",past the keeper first and then short third. God that must be annoying as a fielding team but it is expertly done and he has a fifty. He's kept his scoring rate up even as wickets fall around. Allows this legcutter to come on in the corridor and stabs it late
14.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, 1 run","yorker outside off, gets low and guides this to third man's left"
14.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, 2 runs","good length outside off, neatly punched to sweeper's right"
14.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, 2 runs","misfield at extra cover. Good length outside off, punched sweetly off the middle and it's slipped through from under the fielder"
14.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandya, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut firmly to sweeper cover"
14.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandya, no run","good length and in at off stump, 138kph. Punched back to the bowler on the rise"
14.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Pandya, 1 wide","bouncer, wide outside off. Too short and sailing over his head"
14.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, 1 run","slower short ball, wide outside off. Backs away and chops to sweeper cover"
13.6,"Archer to Krunal, OUT","taken at midwicket. You can almost see this coming when Krunal is up against elite pace. Short and at his ribs and he gets in poor positions, and that's what's happened. Pinned right back, trying to pivot on his back toe, with the front leg in the air. Can't get a horizontal bat at this, just ends up shoveling awkwardly to the fielder on the circle"
13.5,"Archer to Krunal, no run","beaten on the drive this time. A slower ball, good length and outside off. Was looking to go aerial and through the line, over mid-off. It was a knuckle ball"
13.4,"Archer to Krunal, no run","past the hook. Short and steep and fast at middle stump, he's not close to making connection"
13.3,"Archer to Yadav, 1 run",another short legcutter as SKY backs into the leg side to use his pace for the slash. Late cut down to third man
13.2,"Archer to Yadav, no run","legcutter, short and at middle stump. Backs away to try and open up the point region. Checks his cut to the fielder"
13.1,"Archer to Krunal, 1 run","good length at middle stump, deep in the crease to tap this into the leg side"
12.6,"Tewatia to Krunal, 1 run","googly, short and wide outside off. Under-edge on the attempted cut"
12.5,"Tewatia to Yadav, 1 run","full outside off, big stride out to flick to deep midwicket's right"
12.4,"Tewatia to Krunal, 1 run",short and across him outside off. Cut to sweeper cover
12.3,"Tewatia to Yadav, 1 run","good length at middle, steps out and drills to long-on"
12.2,"Tewatia to Krunal, 1 run","leading edge down to long-off as he looks to whip this googly from outside off, off the back foot"
12.1,"Tewatia to Krunal, SIX runs",launched over the bowler's head. Good length delivery angled into his swinging arc and he's quicky down on a knee to lift this
11.6,"Gopal to Krunal, 1 run","googly, full on leg stump, well forward to drive to long-on"
11.5,"Gopal to Krunal, no run","googly, short and wide outside off. Beaten on the cut"
11.4,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run","googly, good length and into leg stump. Flicked to deep midwicket"
11.3,"Gopal to Yadav, 2 runs","crashed to sweeper's right. Front-of-the-hand overpitched ball, wide outside off. Goes inside-out"
11.2,"Gopal to Yadav, FOUR runs","spanked past extra cover! Short and just outside off, goes the other way this time - deep in the crease - and hits it aerially and to sweeper's right"
11.1,"Gopal to Yadav, FOUR runs","sweetly placed. Good length and a legbreak outside off. He gets well outside the line of that and sweeps so perfectly, all along the floor with a big stride. There's no one at long leg"
10.6,"Tewatia to Krunal, no run","short of a length, sliding into the corridor. Chopped to backward point"
10.5,"Tewatia to Krunal, no run",appeal for lbw turned as he's struck in front of leg. That was spinning in and might taken an inside edge too as he looked to defend
10.4,"Tewatia to Yadav, 1 run",good length and sliding onto leg stump. Punched to midwicket off the back foot
10.3,"Tewatia to Krunal, 1 run","low full toss on leg stump, punched along the floor to long-on"
10.2,"Tewatia to Krunal, no run","googly, short of a good length and just outside off. Opens the face and gets it to short third"

9.6,"Gopal to Krunal, 1 leg bye","full on leg stump, looks to sweep, deflected to long leg off the pad"
9.5,"Gopal to Krunal, no run",falls short of the bowler. Good length and dipping outside off. Pokes with hard hands
9.4,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run","good length and just outside off, punched to sweeper cover off the back foot"
9.3,"Gopal to Yadav, no run","good length, tossed right up at off. Watchfully defended on the front foot"
9.2,"Gopal to Ishan, OUT","taken at extra cover! Oh boy, Ishan Kishan. For all the other goodness he gives you, he has a bit of misadventure too. That's what this is. Gopal back to the regulation legbreak again, tossed right up outside off. Kishan wants to pump him over the leg side first up but loses shape, slices it up for Samson to take to his right"
9.1,"Gopal to Rohit Sharma, OUT","lofted straight to long-on. Looks like a regulation legbreak, flighted and dipping. Didn't bowl one of these in his last over. Rewarded immediately in this one. Rohit steps out and doesn't make the pitch of this. Wants to lift it straight but he's having to reach out and it's taken well within the boundary"
8.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, FOUR runs","thick edge past the keeper. Short outside off, 141kph, has the room for the slash and that's what he does. More third man runs"
8.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, no run","three dots in a row. Once again, SKY backing too far into the leg side. This is short and wide and he gets an under-edge to Buttler on the cut"
8.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, no run","good length offcutter, wide outside off. Makes too much room and can only get this square drive as far as backward point"
8.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, no run",yorker and just outside off. Jammed into the pitch
8.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, FOUR runs","oh lovely. Short and in the corridor, stays firmly planted this time and allows it right under his eye before nudging it through the cordon region. The other side of third man this time"
8.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, dances leg side of it and then jabs at it. Almost got a little to far from that, but managed to get the chop in, with bottom hand coming off. Wide of third man"
7.6,"Gopal to Rohit Sharma, no run","googly, full and outside off. Leans in and pushes it back to the bowler"
7.5,"Gopal to Rohit Sharma, no run","googly, short and into off stump. Cut straight to backward point"
7.4,"Gopal to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","launched over deep midwicket. Dropped short, a googly, but outside off. Sits up nicely and the lofted pull rarely fails off this particular bat"
7.3,"Gopal to Yadav, 1 run","good length and into the pads, punched to deep midwicket off the back foot"
7.2,"Gopal to Yadav, no run","front-of-the-hand again, and this time an offcutter. Tapped down the pitch"
7.1,"Gopal to Yadav, FOUR runs","lofted over extra cover. Peak SKY. Full and front-of-the hand this, like a legcutter. Gives it a nice skid onto SKY who lifts it inside-out"

6.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, 1 wide","short and down leg side, beaten on the attempted glance"
6.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, opens the face and guides to third man"
6.5,"Kartik Tyagi to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","good bouncer, but a bit too high says leg umpire. That was directed right at the head"
6.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, 1 bye","short and just outside off, pulls above it and is beaten. It lands short of Buttler and deflects towards fine leg"
6.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, no run","short and wide outside off, cut firmly to backward point on the bounce. Fumbles it but recovers quickly enough to stop the single"
6.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short and wide outside off, sliced to third man"
6.1,"Kartik Tyagi to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs",mistimed pull over midwicket. Short and getting big once again off the pitch. About 137kph. Rohit drags it from outside off
5.6,"Tom Curran to Yadav, no run","good length on middle stump, flicked into the leg side"
5.6,"Tom Curran to Yadav, 1 wide",good length and down leg side as he looks to flick that
5.5,"Tom Curran to Yadav, FOUR runs","oh nicely adjusted. Full and into leg stump. Looks like he was into that a bit early, but he continued to offer the full face and then used his wrists to place that perfectly to short midwicket's left"
5.4,"Tom Curran to Yadav, no run","full and just outside off, driven off the inside half of the bat to short midwicket"
5.3,"Tom Curran to Rohit Sharma, 1 leg bye",appeal for lbw turned down. Good length ball hitting his in front of middle and leg as he shuffles for the flick. Probably missing leg stump with the angle
5.2,"Tom Curran to Rohit Sharma, no run","leading edge as he looks to flick this from middle stump. Third time I'm seeing that this evening, second time from Rohit. Closed the face too soon"
5.1,"Tom Curran to Yadav, 1 run",good length and in the corridor. Opens the face and runs it to third man
4.6,"Kartik Tyagi to Yadav, 1 run","short of a good length, just outside off at 135.7kph. Opens the face to steer this to third man"
4.5,"Kartik Tyagi to de Kock, OUT","a wicket on debut! Short ball gets too steep for QDK. It's at middle stump and angled across him. He's backing into the leg side trying to hook this, but slices it up for Buttler to take to his right"
4.4,"Kartik Tyagi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","diving stop by Rajpoot to his left at short third. 141kph, good length and in the corridor. Rohit leans back for the late cut"
4.3,"Kartik Tyagi to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs",picked up over square leg. A full toss at middle stump. Looks like that slipped out. Rohit has the front leg in the air as he hurriedly puts this away. 141kph
4.2,"Kartik Tyagi to Rohit Sharma, no run","wide of the crease, just short of a good length and angled into Rohit at 135kph. Looks to punch through the covers, gets an inside edge to short fine"
4.1,"Kartik Tyagi to de Kock, 1 run","good length and just outside off at 133kph, nicely forward to defend into the covers"
3.6,"Archer to de Kock, 1 run","short of a length at the hips, whipped with the angle to fine leg"
3.5,"Archer to de Kock, no run","yorker and jut outside off, beaten on the attempted chop"
3.4,"Archer to de Kock, SIX runs","dragged over square leg! This is all hand and eye. Woof. Good length at middle stump, stands his ground and swings across the line to use the pace"
3.3,"Archer to de Kock, FOUR runs","past Rajpoot's dive at fine leg. 150.4kph, short of a good length and down leg side. QDK has a slash at it and it's dipping rapidly on Rajpoot to his left. He puts in a dive but can't get a hand on it. Jofra thinks that was easier than it looked"
3.2,"Archer to de Kock, no run","cops that on the body as it lifts past the outside edge on his attempted glance. 145kph that, good length and on a middle stump line"
3.1,"Archer to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven to cover's right and a fumble from him. Looks like Curran got an awkward bounce"
2.6,"Rajpoot to de Kock, no run",good length and tucking him up in the corridor. Mistimed punch into the covers
2.5,"Rajpoot to de Kock, FOUR runs","gently lifts it over short fine. Full slower ball just outside off, and QDK is moving almost slow-mo. Nicely into the off side, eyes on it the whole time and a little scoop for the four"
2.4,"Rajpoot to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","good length at the stumps, tucked to deep square leg off the back foot"
2.3,"Rajpoot to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","slashed to sweeper's left. Not saving that, third man or not. Short outside off, waits on it again and cuts late"
2.2,"Rajpoot to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","lofted over the long-off boundary. He's taking to Rajpoot's pace here. Full and just outside off, no movement. Sliding nicely on for him to go through the line after offering the full face"
2.1,"Rajpoot to Rohit Sharma, no run","full and just outside off, well forward to defend into the covers"
1.6,"Gopal to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",good length and turning into leg stump. Clipped to deep midwicket off the back foot
1.5,"Gopal to de Kock, 1 run",under-edge into the off side as this front-of-the-hand quicker one stays low and goes across him. He was looking to cut

1.3,"Gopal to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",good length and sliding in at the corridor. Punched to long-off's left off the back foot

1.1,"Gopal to de Kock, 1 run","full on off stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
0.6,"Rajpoot to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs",carved between point and short third. More and more teams are now putting a sweeper out and having third man inside. Short of a good length from Rajpoot and quite wide outside off. Rohit allows that on and picks up some easy runs
0.5,"Rajpoot to Rohit Sharma, no run",good length and wide awayswinger. Slashes at that and is beaten
0.4,"Rajpoot to Rohit Sharma, no run",good length outswinger from off stump. Closes the face on that as he defends into the covers off the leading edge

0.2,"Rajpoot to de Kock, 1 wide","full and swung down leg side, beaten on the flick"
0.1,"Rajpoot to de Kock, FOUR runs","past mid-off. Full and floaty, just outside off. Leans into that with almost no feet, but he's right on top of it to pat it past his partner"

19.4,"Patel to Saini, 1 run","makes room, swings hard, gets a thick edge to third man"
19.3,"Patel to Saini, no run","quicker ball, cramps him up. Dot"
19.2,"Patel to Saini, FOUR runs","Saini getting his own back. He dishes out beamers and bouncers, but is courageous enough to take it when it is thrown at him. Now he gets under a slower ball and lofts it over mid-off"
19.1,"Patel to Saini, 2 runs","slower short ball, cut square of third man for two"
18.6,"Nortje to Siraj, OUT","full and straight, Siraj is off the cut strip trying to make room. He hits the base of the middle stump"

17.3,"Rabada to Udana, OUT","slower ball to Udana, not to Saini. And he gets a top edge as he backs away. Taken at extra cover"
17.2,"Rabada to Saini, 1 run","bouncer. Tewatia's, Rashid's, Stoinis's, everyone's revenge will be taken by your Rabada. Mean bouncer, he throws up his hands to protect his face"
17.1,"Rabada to Dubey, OUT","straight quick length ball. Bude swings in Abu Dhabi, Rabada hits the wicket in Dubai. This is becoming a huge NRR blip for RCB. Oh hang on. We are checking if DC had four inside the circle. Ashwin might be the culprit here. Did he charge in enough to be inside the circle when the ball is delivered? Ashwin is fielding at midwicket. Just outside the circle with Rabada three steps from bowling. Now we get a new angle, and Ashwin is on the line when Rabada releases the ball. So this shouldn't be a no-ball. fair delivery. Dube stays out"

16.1,"Nortje to Dubey, 1 run","full, outside off, pushed to mid-off for one"
15.6,"Rabada to Sundar, OUT","slower bouncer, and that produces the wicket. Rabada has his share of two again. Easy as. Cramps him up too with it, and he gets no power into the pull. Caught at midwicket"

15.4,"Rabada to Sundar, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, jams against his bat as he looks to make room. Single into the off side"

15.1,"Rabada to Sundar, FOUR runs","short, quick, at him, he makes room and plays an impressive upper-cut despite there not being any room. That will help RCB's NRR"
14.6,"Ashwin to Dubey, no run","drift into the pads, Dube plays this to short straight midwicket"
14.5,"Ashwin to Dubey, SIX runs",Dube takes on the short boundary on the leg side and goes against the turn. He gets enough in it to clear wide long-on

13.4,"Rabada to Dubey, 1 run","quick short ball, follows him, but he manages to run this down to third man"
13.3,"Rabada to Kohli, OUT","that is the game. Kohli has left himself too much to do. Now he is obliged to slog at the best bowler. Gets a bottom edge, which carries to the keeper. He will have to review how he misread the pitch and went pace, pace, pace. Then he was pretty much forced to show no intent against spin because of the grip on the surface and the three wickets lost inside the Powerplay"
13.2,"Rabada to Sundar, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, runs this down to third man for one"
13.1,"Rabada to Kohli, 1 run","shuffles inside the line of a length, ball, gets a single to deep square leg"
13.1,"Rabada to Kohli, 1 wide",wide down the leg side. Looking to stay stump to stump and slipping down
12.6,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run","short ball, might be on-pace, but it is wide, and Kohli gets no power into the pull. Just the single"
12.5,"Patel to Sundar, 1 run",mid-off has gone back and Sundar gets a single there
12.4,"Patel to Sundar, FOUR runs","lovely shot first ball. Sundar, what a player. Offcutter, on a length, and he plays the drive on the up with an open face, placing it between mid-off and extra cover"
12.3,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run","another slower short ball, pulled to short fine for one"
12.2,"Patel to Kohli, 2 runs","shorter this time, pulled fine of deep square leg for a couple"
12.1,"Patel to Kohli, SIX runs","Kohli wakes up. he is not waiting as long as Dhoni does. He jumps out of the crease to treat Harshal's slower balls like an offspinner, and lofts it handsomely over wide long-on"
12.1,"Patel to Kohli, 1 wide","slower offcutter, but down the leg side"
11.6,"Axar Patel to Ali, OUT",and Ali is forced to take on the big side of the boundary for some impetus. He has no choice with Kohli setting himself up Dhoni style for the back end. Axar cramps him up with a low full toss. Perhaps a yorker but Ali has turned this into a fullie by jumping out of the crase. Hits it only as far as deep midwicket
11.5,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","full and straight, driven to long-on for another one. No intent to take the spinners on. By a captain who didn't bowl his spinners out. Didn't ask his big fast bowler to bowl cutters when he was bowling beamers"
11.4,"Axar Patel to Ali, 1 run","tries the big hit into the big side of the field, the leg side. Mis-hits it for a single"
11.3,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","length, into the pads, single to deep midwicket"
11.2,"Axar Patel to Ali, 1 run","smart bowling. Sees him step out, tries to slide this wide, and Moeen gets the toe end to save himself from a stumping"
11.1,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","flat, into the pads, no pressure. Single to long-on"
10.6,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run","down the wicket, but Harshal pulls the length back and bowls the slower offcutter to allow them just the single"
10.5,"Patel to Kohli, 2 runs","low full toss, again no attempt to hit a boundary. Places this into the leg side for a couple"
10.4,"Patel to Kohli, no run","appeal for both lbw and bat-pad it seems. Offcutter, beats Kohli, hits him high on the pad and lobs back to the bowler. Not out on both counts as this is headed down and there is no edge"
10.3,"Patel to Kohli, 2 runs","full toss, on the pads, gets just the two as he is not looking to hit sixes just yet"
10.2,"Patel to Ali, 1 leg bye","slower offcutter again, hits Ali on the thigh pad as he looks to pull. Just one leg-bye"
10.1,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run","down the wicket, Harshal bowls the slower one, pushed to deep midwicket for one"
9.6,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","unlike Ashwin, Axar closes out the over without trying anything fancy. Quick length ball outside off, pushed to long-off for one"
9.5,"Axar Patel to Kohli, no run","flatter, outside off, cut straight to point"
9.4,"Axar Patel to Kohli, no run","slow, full, straght, defended back. Kohli's strike rate under 100 now"
9.3,"Axar Patel to Kohli, no run","even slower, 85ks, some turn from leg to off. Defended"
9.2,"Axar Patel to Kohli, no run","slow through the air, full and straight, short straight midwicket denies them the single"
9.1,"Axar Patel to Ali, 1 run",Ali goes deep to pull this length ball over midwicket for one
8.6,"Ashwin to Kohli, 2 runs","full, on the pads, swept away fine for a couple"
8.6,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 wide","little pause in his stride, bowls a wide down the leg side. Seems like the carrom ball but doesn't turn enough"
8.5,"Ashwin to Ali, 1 run","flatter, into the pads, pushed down to long-on for one"
8.4,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run","full outside off, driven to long-off for another single"
8.3,"Ashwin to Ali, 1 run","nice offbreak. Slower through the air, gets turn, runs off the outside half of the bat for one"
8.2,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run","offbreak, hit down to long-on for one"
8.1,"Ashwin to Kohli, no run",carrom ball? Draws a leading edge from Kohli. Not full enough for his push down the ground
7.6,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","tossed up wide, driven to long-off for one"
7.5,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 2 runs","slower through the air, Kohli runs it down fine of short third and takes on Ashwin's slowness in the field to come back for two"
7.4,"Axar Patel to Ali, 1 run","down the wicket, Axar shortens the length, concedes just the single"
7.3,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover for one. Bowling to his field"
7.2,"Axar Patel to Kohli, no run","slows this down, and the midwicket is straight and short to deny Kohli that single. Field placement on point"
7.1,"Axar Patel to Kohli, no run","back of a length, into the pads, beats his punch, hits him on the pad"
6.6,"Ashwin to Ali, no run","some turn, and it stops at him too. Pushed to straight cover. It is gripping. Kohli's use of his spinners becomes more and more questionable"
6.5,"Ashwin to Ali, FOUR runs","swept away, and even though there is a deep midwicket in place, he has rolled his wrists to place this square of the man"
6.4,"Ashwin to Ali, no run","slower through the air, drifting in, skids through, angles in, hits the pad"
6.3,"Ashwin to Ali, no run","flat, length ball, angling in, pushed to cover"
6.2,"Ashwin to Kohli, 1 run","offbreak, slightly round-arm, pushed to long-on for one"
6.1,"Ashwin to Ali, 1 run","drifting in, full, runs off the inside half of the bat. Pant's reaction suggests Ali has no idea about this"
5.6,"Nortje to Kohli, no run","bouncer, 147ks, just outside off. Kohli wants to have nothing to do with it"
5.5,"Nortje to AB, OUT","finally someone takes a catch. A huge ""come on"" is belted out by someone. Short of a length, quick, nearing 150ks, and de Villiers is hurried into the pull. The top edge goes higher than the ring-of-fire lights, but Dhawan settles under it and takes it. And then comes out the thigh-five"
5.4,"Nortje to AB, FOUR runs","oh helicopter off the back foot. Goes deep to a quick short-of-a-length ball, and whips it over mid-odff. What wrists. Incredible"
5.3,"Nortje to AB, no run","missed run-out. Kohli is gone for all money as de Villiers has hit this too sweetly to mid-on. Kohli does the done thing: run if you see your striker running. AB, though, stops after a couple of steps. Rabada misses with the throw"
5.2,"Nortje to AB, no run","full and fast, driven hard but straight to mid-on"
5.1,"Nortje to Kohli, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, and he finds short fine leg"
4.6,"Patel to AB, FOUR runs","hit hard in the air at catching height for mid-off, but the mid-off is too wide for this shot. Four to de Villiers"
4.5,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run","short of a length, wide outside off, runs this down to third man for one"
4.4,"Patel to AB, 1 run","down the leg side, and he gets away with it. Single to short fine leg"
4.3,"Patel to Kohli, 1 run","wide length ball, pushed just to the left of cover for one"
4.2,"Patel to Kohli, no run","on a length, on off, defended back to him"
4.1,"Patel to Kohli, FOUR runs","but if you bowl plum half-volleys on the pads, Kohli won't need the single to get off strike. Clipped away for an easy boundary that takes him to 9000 T20 runs"
3.6,"Axar Patel to Finch, OUT",lovely lovely bowling. He knows there is turn on offer so he is bowling slower and flighting them. It dips to create the gap between where the ball pitches and Finch's reach. And then it turns to take the outside edge for Pant to catch
3.5,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","flatter, quicker, fuller, pushed to long-off for one"
3.4,"Axar Patel to Kohli, no run","lovely bowling. Beating Kohli on the forward-defensive. Creates the gap by getting dip on this ball, and then it rips past his outside edge"
3.3,"Axar Patel to Finch, 1 leg bye","angling in, no room for Finch. Another leg-bye"
3.2,"Axar Patel to Kohli, 1 run","flatter, angling in, worked to leg"
3.1,"Axar Patel to Kohli, FOUR runs",loosener. Just a floated half-volley. Not much action on it. Kohli loves it. Beats extra cover with his drive
2.6,"Ashwin to Padikkal, OUT","down the wicket, Padikkal shows lack of experience. Ashwin makes him play the shot he doesn't want to play. Slows down the ball, goes a touch wider, makes him drag it to leg where deep midwicket is waiting. Padikkal wants to hit long-on, but he has let a master offspinner make him play the shot he wants him to play"
2.5,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run","dipping offbreak, slow, worked to leg for one"
2.4,"Ashwin to Padikkal, 1 run",punched down the ground
2.3,"Ashwin to Padikkal, no run",turn with the new ball. Beaten
2.2,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 run",manages to place this wide of deep square for one
2.1,"Ashwin to Finch, 2 runs","flat, quick offbreak, pushed to leg for a dot"
1.6,"Nortje to Finch, 1 leg bye",finally the inswinger to Finch. And it is quick too. Beats him but is headed down leg. One leg-bye
1.5,"Nortje to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length, tucked away off the hip for one"
1.4,"Nortje to Finch, 1 run","driven back hard, Nortje gets a hand to it"
1.3,"Nortje to Finch, 2 runs","and this time Dhawan's being deep has given him a chance. Finch has a big swing at a length ball outside off, and he gets a healthy edge. Dhawan goes up for the catch but it still manages to burst through. Casinos open for Finch tonight?"
1.2,"Nortje to Finch, no run","short of a length, closer to the stumps, punched to extra cover"
1.2,"Nortje to Finch, 1 wide","short and wide again, and it is called wide"
1.1,"Nortje to Finch, FOUR runs",oh a loosener. Everybody bowls straight at Finch. Nortje goes short of a length and wide. Finch says thank you very much
0.6,"Rabada to Finch, 1 run","edged and short of slip. This is excellent Test-match bowling to Finch. Full, just outside off, seams away, takes the edge, but Dhawan is too deep at slip. I can understand that: you stand deep because in T20 batsman are swinging hard and edges carry further"
0.5,"Rabada to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, runs this down to third man"
0.4,"Rabada to Finch, 1 run","yorker on the pads, dug out for one"
0.3,"Rabada to Finch, no run","full, fast, pushed to mid-on"
0.2,"Rabada to Finch, no run","another drop. A sitter. Length ball, on off, Finch defends, and the bat face turns and it lobs back for an easy catch to Rabada. But he spills it"
0.2,"Rabada to Finch, 1 wide","wide down the leg side, looking for that lbw ball against Finch"
0.1,"Rabada to Padikkal, 1 run",and that is some tone. Hits him high on the bat with a quick length ball. Padikkal takes the bottom hand off to keep this down. Get a single to cover
19.6,"Udana to Hetmyer, 2 runs","good full wide ball, hit to deep cover. Not many batsmen take the suicidal second off the last ball for some reason, but these guys are not bothered about their averages. Hetmyer charges off for the second, which looks like will be his wicket, but Kohli's throw is wide, and he completes the second. I would have liked them to go for the third too. Keep running till you are run out"
19.5,"Udana to Stoinis, 1 run","yorker, just outside off, dug out to long-on for one"
19.4,"Udana to Hetmyer, 1 run","full and wide, driven to deep cover. Just the one"
19.3,"Udana to Hetmyer, SIX runs","oh he gets the straight full toss that he can drop over the short leg-side boundary for a six. If this is not an attempted bluff, this is pretty poor from Udana. Has to go wide yorkers"
19.2,"Udana to Stoinis, 1 leg bye",Stoinis shuffles across to look for a ramp. Udana beats him with a low full toss. They get a leg-bye
19.1,"Udana to Hetmyer, 1 run","wide and full, Hetmyer hits this to long-off for one"
18.6,"Siraj to Stoinis, FOUR runs","and Stoinis picks the leg side to bring up his fifty. Gets well across to this wide length ball, and sort of shovels this over square leg for four"
18.5,"Siraj to Hetmyer, 1 run","fuller now, driven to long-on for one"
18.4,"Siraj to Hetmyer, no run",left alone. Hetmyer knows this short ball is too high. He wants a wide call.The umpires disagree
18.3,"Siraj to Hetmyer, no run","on-pace bouncer, beats Hetmyer on the pull. There is one man appealing for a catch at the wicket. That is Kohli at the boundary. They don't review it, though"
18.2,"Siraj to Pant, OUT","timber. Pant looks for the big hit over the leg side as Saini pitches short. He is deep in the crease and gives this his all. Siraj, though, has bowled a slower ball, and Pant only gets a bottom edge onto the stumps"
18.2,"Siraj to Pant, 1 wide","short, well down the leg side, Pant looks to pull it over short fine, but is beaten. Wide this time"
18.1,"Siraj to Pant, no run","slower shortish ball, he turns his stance to reverse-ramp it over short third, but he is beaten when doing so"
18.1,"Siraj to Pant, (no ball) SIX runs","another beamer. Head high. And most incredibly, Pant gets out of the way, and ramps it for a six over long leg"
17.6,"Udana to Pant, 1 run","and he does well to finish off. Full and wide, doesn't allow him a free hit to the short boundary. Driven hard but only a single to deep cover"
17.5,"Udana to Stoinis, 1 run","lovely yorker, just outside off, dug out to extra cover for one"
17.4,"Udana to Pant, 1 leg bye",shuffling across to try to access the short leg-side boundary but Udana does well by staying wide with the yorker. Concedes just the leg-bye
17.3,"Udana to Pant, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Slower ball, short of a length, not easy to get power behind it, but he lofts this over extra cover for four"
17.2,"Udana to Stoinis, 1 run","wide yorker, dug out to extra cover for one"
17.2,"Udana to Stoinis, 1 wide","too wide, trying to stay out of his reach"
17.1,"Udana to Pant, 1 run",wide full toss with short third man in the circle. Playing with fire. But he gets just the single to deep point
16.6,"Saini to Pant, 1 run","another full toss, hit hard into the pitch, and it bounces over Saini for a single to long-on"
16.5,"Saini to Pant, FOUR runs","excellent batting. He knows the field so well. Short of a length, at the hip, and he turns this around the corner with soft hands. Just placing it past short fine leg to use Saini's pace"
16.4,"Saini to Pant, SIX runs","Pant sort of makes up for that refused second. He picks the slower ball, stays deep in the crease, and lofts this back over Saini's head for a small six. Finally over a 100 SR"
16.3,"Saini to Stoinis, 1 run","low full toss, wide outside off to try to make him hit to the big part of the field. drilled wide of long-on. Pant refuses to run the second. That is poor from Pant. Stoinis is filthy with him and is stranded mid-pitch, but Kohli attacks the throw and fails to collect it clean. Missed the run-out there"
16.2,"Saini to Stoinis, FOUR runs","shuffles across to get under a 149ks length ball, and swipes it to the short boundary into the leg side for four more"
16.1,"Saini to Stoinis, 2 runs","another high full toss. He has placed this to deep midwicket, but it remains to be seen if this will be called too. Not called a no-ball. Dips just below the waist"
15.6,"Siraj to Stoinis, 1 run","short, into the body, short fine leg is up, but he can't get it that fine. Gets just the single to deep backward square leg"
15.5,"Siraj to Stoinis, 2 runs","slower ball, played with soft hands, into the bigger part of the field, takes a couple"
15.4,"Siraj to Pant, 1 run","mis-hit to long-on, but it falls short"
15.3,"Siraj to Pant, no run","on a length, outside off, driven on the up, but straight to extra cover"
15.2,"Siraj to Stoinis, 1 run",single to deep cover this time
15.1,"Siraj to Stoinis, FOUR runs","slower ball. It is too full and too wide, and Stoinis has enough time to recover. Stays deep into the crease, and absolutely rockets this past extra cover. No one is laying a finger on that one"
14.6,"Saini to Stoinis, 1 run","dropped. Yet another one goes down in Dubai. Low full toss. Stoinis goes deep into the crease but doesn't get enough power into this. It lobs towards wide long-on. Chahal runs to his left from deep midwicket, and it slips through his hands"
14.5,"Saini to Stoinis, FOUR runs","wide ball on the free hit. Misses the yorker by a few inches, and he goes over point for four more. That is a way of getting your own back after having jammed by a beamer"
14.5,"Saini to Stoinis, (no ball)","high dangerous chest-high full toss at 143ks. No slower ball. No signs of dew. Stoinis is hit on the glove but there is no hurt or injury. Sunil Gavaskar is thinking the same. ""No way can you tell me that that slipped,"" he says on air. I stand to be corrected but I haven't seen an apology from Saini either"
14.4,"Saini to Stoinis, FOUR runs",doesn't get all of this but he is going straight and it is straight enough of long-on. Saini gives him the length. No pace taken off it. Stoinis will keep coming at you if you do that
14.3,"Saini to Stoinis, SIX runs","short boundary on the leg side. Saini bowls short of a length, Stoinis stays deep in the crease to swing his arms through it, and goes over midwicket for a small flat six"
14.2,"Saini to Stoinis, no run",lovely yorker. On off. Dug out
14.1,"Saini to Pant, 1 leg bye","quick length ball, outside leg, beats him, goes for a leb-bye"
13.6,"Ali to Stoinis, FOUR runs","uff that is some power. Ali finally comes back to Stoinis with a straight ball, and he clears his front leg and swings those tree trunks at it. Back over Ali's head this goes for four"
13.6,"Ali to Stoinis, 1 wide",another wide doing the same
13.6,"Ali to Stoinis, 1 wide",tosses this one wide as Stoinis backs away. Goes too wide
13.5,"Ali to Pant, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to long-off for one"
13.4,"Ali to Stoinis, 1 run","fuller, quick, punched down to long-on for one"
13.3,"Ali to Stoinis, SIX runs","Stoinis takes on the long boundary as Ali pitches short, but he has those Popeye biceps behind it. Goes over deep midwicket with ease"
13.2,"Ali to Stoinis, no run","flat, quick offbreak, Stoinis is cramped as he backs away. Hit back to Ali"
13.1,"Ali to Pant, 1 run","full, straight, soft hands to work it to leg for one"
12.6,"Chahal to Pant, 1 run","lovely bowling. Pant shimmies down, Chahal bowls a legbreak at just 73ks. it dips and it turns. Pant has to show respect. Takes a single to leg"
12.5,"Chahal to Stoinis, 1 run","down the wicket, not to its pitch, but pushes this wide of Chahal for a single to long-off"
12.4,"Chahal to Pant, 1 run","wrong'un, full, outside leg, worked away to deep square for one"
12.3,"Chahal to Pant, no run","the length is pulled back, and Kohli is tight at short midwicket to prevent the single"
12.2,"Chahal to Pant, FOUR runs","slog sweep into the long boundary. Capitals forced to take on a low-percentage option, but he has placed this in front of deep midwicket"
12.1,"Chahal to Stoinis, 1 run","chipped back, shouts of catch it, but it slips through his fingers. No real power in the shot either. Chahal has to leap high, but this counts as a drop"
11.6,"Ali to Stoinis, 1 run","denies him the slogging length, Stoinis waits for it to turn and works this to short fine for one"
11.5,"Ali to Stoinis, 2 runs",whips a full ball wide of long-on for a couple
11.4,"Ali to Pant, 1 run","tossed up outside off, pushed to deep cover for one"
11.3,"Ali to Iyer, OUT","Paddikal takes a superb catch at deep midwicket. Another team change works. Ali gets some dip on this, which means Iyer's attempt at hitting a six has more height than length on it. Paddikal, a tall man, sets himself up at the midwicket fence, takes the catch, lobs the ball back up as he falls over, steps out, comes back in, completes the catch. Calm as"
11.2,"Ali to Pant, 1 run","full, into the pads, worked away to leg for one"
11.1,"Ali to Iyer, 1 run","full, on off, driven to long-on for one"

10.5,"Chahal to Pant, no run","full, middle and leg, punched to midwicket"
10.4,"Chahal to Iyer, 1 run",wide leg-break but Iyer drags it back and chips him back over his head. Kohli at long-on is quick to come around to deny them the second

9.4,"Udana to S Dhawan, OUT","Dhawan perishes looking for the big hit. Gets a length ball, sees he can hit a six, but is slightly early into the shot. The bat face closes a little, and he doesn't get enough power into it. Caught at long-on"

9.2,"Udana to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, chest high, dropped to leg with soft hands"
9.1,"Udana to S Dhawan, 1 run","Dhawan down the wicket, hits this straight, mid-off is up, but Udana gets his foot in the way. Saves three runs"
8.6,"Siraj to Iyer, no run","a lot of movement across and back away, but Siraj nails the perfect yorker. Dug out. What a change this is proving out to be to get Siraj into this game"
8.5,"Siraj to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, into the hip, worked to leg for one"
8.4,"Siraj to S Dhawan, no run","sharp. Siraj has got wheels tonight. Dhawan skips down the track, and Siraj tells him nosireebob, not against me. Dhawan has to get out of the way of this bouncer"
8.3,"Siraj to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, stump to stump, worked to leg for one"
8.2,"Siraj to Iyer, no run","short of a length, on off, angling in, punched to midwicket. Iyer wants a single off the midwicket, but Dhawan sends him back"

6.5,"Siraj to Iyer, FOUR runs",Iyer won't mind that sighter. Gentle length ball on the pads. He plays the pick-up over square leg. Shaw must be wondering why he didn't get this
6.4,"Siraj to Shaw, OUT","Kohli's shouts of ""come on"" echo in the empty stadium. Shaw has gloves Siraj through to AB. Good short ball. Quick, high, and into the body.

6.3,"Siraj to S Dhawan, 1 run","on a length, outside off, driven with an open face, gets a single to deep point"
6.2,"Siraj to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",maybe this is why Dhawan didn't want that single. Disimisses this shortish delivery through midwicket for four. Lovely pull
6.1,"Siraj to S Dhawan, no run","big mix-up. Dhawan drops this shortish ball at his toes, and doesn't look up at Shaw, who has come to within a hand-shaking distance. Shaw scampers back and makes it"
5.6,"Sundar to S Dhawan, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, helped along for a single to short fine leg"
5.5,"Sundar to Shaw, 1 run","slower in the air, Shaw goes for the sweep again. Doesn't nail it, which is just as well. Falls short of deep square leg"
5.4,"Sundar to Shaw, FOUR runs","gets down for a sweep, gets inside the line, Sundar fires it in, but Shaw doesn't hold back. Gets a top edge but straight over AB's head. The first boundary off Sundar tonight"

4.4,"Chahal to Shaw, 1 run","on a length, can't drive, can't slog. Pushed wide of Chahal for a risky single, but his pick-up is not clean. We will never know if Shaw was struggling here"
4.3,"Chahal to Shaw, SIX runs","overcompensates now and bowls a plum half-volley. Shaw is going against the turn after clearing his front leg, but this is a new ball and he has gone only to long-on and not midwicket. New balls please"
4.2,"Chahal to Shaw, FOUR runs","poor ball. Short, wide, and cut away in front of square. The kind of ball you might throw down to a batsman short on form and confidence just to make him feel better"
4.1,"Chahal to S Dhawan, 1 run","down the wicket, beaten in the flight as Chahal pulls the length back, but Dhawan manages to push him down to long-on for one"
3.6,"Sundar to S Dhawan, 1 run",speared into the pads to protect another over. Just the single into the leg side
3.5,"Sundar to Shaw, 1 run","on a length, pretty straight, punched down to long-on for one"

3.2,"Sundar to Shaw, 1 run","fuller, and worked into the leg side for one"
3.1,"Sundar to Shaw, no run","turn. DC won't mind this. Turn and bounce actually. From short of a length, into the ribs, hits his glove, then his chest, and falls away from AB"
2.6,"Saini to Shaw, 1 run",pulled away as Saini gets a little big on him. It excites RCB but the ball falls well short of deep square leg
2.5,"Saini to Shaw, no run","on a length, straight, punched hard to mid-on. No chance to get a single as he has hit this hard"
2.4,"Saini to Shaw, SIX runs","nobody is coming in the way of this hit. Shaw makes room, and gets under a full quick ball and lofts it over extra cover for a six. This is some exciting start from DC"
2.3,"Saini to Shaw, no run","crunched away. On a length, on the up. If I were short cover, I would be getting out of the way. Right now, though, Kohli is the man, and he fields it without fuss. Must have stung his hand. But he doesn't show"
2.2,"Saini to S Dhawan, 3 runs","on a length, pitched outside leg, angling towards middle, punched away through midwicket"
2.1,"Saini to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Just short of a half-volley, but gives him room to open his arm. Dhawan stays inside the line and drives it between cover-point and cover"
1.6,"Sundar to S Dhawan, 1 run","quicker, into the pads, protecting a good over. Dhawan gets a single to long-on"
1.5,"Sundar to S Dhawan, no run","Dhawan makes room early, Sundar watches the feet closely, and he flights this well outside off to beat him"

1.3,"Sundar to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, into the pads, worked to deep square for one"
1.2,"Sundar to S Dhawan, no run","slower through the air, Dhawan looks for the big sweep, early into the shot, beaten, but the ball is headed down leg"
1.1,"Sundar to S Dhawan, no run","quick, on a length, into the pads, pushed to midwicket"
0.6,"Udana to Shaw, FOUR runs","lovely flick-pull. Short of a length, hip-high, and he unfurls his wrists to impart power into this and hit it through square leg"
0.5,"Udana to Shaw, FOUR runs","slower ball, 102ks, but a leg-side half-volley, and Shaw clips it uppishly through midwicket for four"
0.4,"Udana to Shaw, no run","some seam movement?. On a length, on off, beats his push-drive with away movement. It does go off the seam a little"
0.3,"Udana to Shaw, FOUR runs","a touch too short, and Shaw is a short man so he has more time to pull this. He goes square of forward square leg, and along the ground"
0.2,"Udana to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, into the body, tucked away towards long leg"
0.1,"Udana to Shaw, 1 leg bye","length ball on the pads, gets away with just one leg-bye"
17.4,"Shami to du Plessis, FOUR runs","and that'll do it! What middle order problems? Low full toss outside off, Faf leans in and punches that to the extra cover boundary to seal a ten-wicket win"
17.3,"Shami to du Plessis, SIX runs","oh come on Faf. One handed slice over extra cover. Full outside off, front leg in the leg side, bottom hand off the bat and that sails away"
17.2,"Shami to du Plessis, 2 runs","slower short ball at off stump, pulled to deep midwicket's left"
17.1,"Shami to Watson, 1 run","full outside off, sliced to sweeper's left. A miscue as he looks to muscle this"

16.5,"Jordan to du Plessis, FOUR runs","scythed past short third man. Yorker outside off, executed to perfection. But Faf opens the face late and gets it fine of that fielder"

16.1,"Jordan to du Plessis, no run","yorker length just outside off, jammed into the covers"

14.5,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, SIX runs","pummeled over long-on and the equation is under run-a-ball now. Good length and sliding on outside off, down on one knee and drilled on the rise"
14.5,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, 1 wide","short and wide outside off, beaten on the cut. Pooran appeals for catch behind and is met with a wide call"

10.3,"Jordan to Watson, 1 run","yorker at leg stump, jammed down to long-on"

8.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Watson, 1 wide","tossed up full and very wide outside off, left alone"

7.6,"Harpreet Brar to du Plessis, 1 run","full on leg stump, steps out and flicks to deep midwicket"

7.4,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, 1 run","short at middle stump, pulled on the bounce to long-on"
7.3,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, FOUR runs","terrible misfield. Shami at short fine. Full and down leg side, forceful sweep straight at the fielder. He lets it through, between his legs"
7.2,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, FOUR runs",smartly done. Good length ball coming in at middle. He steps across to expose the stumps and ramps this fine. Cottrell is too square at deep backward square to get to that
7.1,"Harpreet Brar to du Plessis, 1 run",good length and into the pads. Whipped to deep midwicket off the back foot
6.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to du Plessis, 1 run","full on middle stump, gets forward and flicks to deep midwicket"
6.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to du Plessis, FOUR runs",shot! Counterpunch. But that's a short ball. Faf is waiting on the front foot and swats it between deep square and deep midwicket
6.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to du Plessis, no run",lbw apeeal turned down. Cops this slider on the pad as he's deep in the cresae for the glance. Going down
6.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to du Plessis, no run",beaten. Good length and turning away marginally outside off as Faf looks to drive. Got that to dip on the batsman

6.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Watson, 1 run","good length and sliding on in the corridor, hurriedly tapped into the covers"

5.3,"Jordan to du Plessis, 2 runs","evades Sarfraz's dive after running back from extra cover. Slower short ball wide outside off, ends up slicing this after stepping out and making room"
5.2,"Jordan to du Plessis, FOUR runs","scooped after a long wait, fine of short fine leg. Slower ball at a good length outside off, drops down on a knee into the side and waits and waits before executing this"
5.1,"Jordan to Watson, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut to deep point"
4.6,"Shami to Watson, 1 run","slower ball at a length just outside off, uppish drive off the back foot, down to long-off"
4.5,"Shami to Watson, no run",beaten on the pull. Might have been a slower one that gripped and rose more than Watson expected outside off
4.4,"Shami to du Plessis, 1 run","short and into the mid-riff, deflected fine with a pull shot"
4.3,"Shami to du Plessis, no run","mistimed drive to midwicket. Overpitched outside off, shuffles into line but gets too much bottom hand as he looks to drive this"
4.2,"Shami to du Plessis, 2 runs","good length and on leg stump, flicked to fine leg's left"
4.1,"Shami to du Plessis, FOUR runs","oh neatly clipped away. Good length slower ball at middle, he a walked deep into the crease and across and had to wait. But did it to perfection as he picked this up over square leg"
4.1,"Shami to du Plessis, 1 wide","short and down leg side, steps across and is beaten on the pull"
3.6,"Harpreet Brar to du Plessis, 1 run","full on off, driven to long-off"
3.5,"Harpreet Brar to du Plessis, no run","massive lbw appeal as he's struck in front of middle but there might have been an inside edge. He was looking to sweep from off stump. Replays will be interesting it hits his back thigh, which might have been outside the line of off stump. Pooran signalled bat, Rahul signals outside off they might both be right"
3.4,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, 1 run","short at middle stump, deep in the crease to clip this to deep midwicket"
3.3,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, FOUR runs",lofted straight again. Long-off is out. He gets forward to this full ball and hits it a little leg side of him
3.2,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, no run",good length ball sliding onto the pads as he goes deep in the crease. Struck outside leg stump trying to glance
3.1,"Harpreet Brar to du Plessis, 1 run","full on middle stump, steps out and drives to mid-on"
2.6,"Cottrell to Watson, no run","short outside off, cut straight to backward point"
2.5,"Cottrell to Watson, FOUR runs","drilled over his partner. Classy. Good length outside off, stride down the pitch and swinging room on the drive allows him to loft it"
2.4,"Cottrell to du Plessis, 1 run","full slower ball at off stump, driven straight to mid-off"
2.3,"Cottrell to du Plessis, 2 runs","safely over square leg. Short ball at middle, gets a lot of elevation on the pull"

2.1,"Cottrell to du Plessis, 1 run","full and wide outside off, mistimed drive to mid-off's left"

1.3,"Shami to Watson, 1 run","short and in the corridor, dabbed down the third man, 141.9kph"
1.3,"Shami to Watson, 5 wide","oh, poor. Full and swung down leg side. Pooran can't even get a hand on that with the dive"
1.2,"Shami to Watson, no run","beaten on the cut. Short and just outside off, past the bat quickly as he looks to cut"
1.1,"Shami to Watson, no run","oh unplayable. That might the perfect ball. Good length, bolt upright seam, very late swerve away as it lands at a length in the corridor. Narrowly past the outside edge as Watson looks to defend"
0.6,"Cottrell to du Plessis, no run","good length and just outside off, defended off the back foot"
0.5,"Cottrell to Watson, 1 run","just clears mid-off! Almost one too many. Full ball just outside off, pushes onto the front foot to try and loft again, this time in the off side. The handle turns in his hand and it's over Rahul's right shoulder before landing safely"
0.4,"Cottrell to Watson, FOUR runs",lofted over mid-on! Full inswinging ball at middle stump and he uses the angle to close the face and clear the infield. Nice trademark forward stride on that too
0.3,"Cottrell to Watson, FOUR runs",short and into the hips with the swing. Stands tall and turns it fine with a glance
0.2,"Cottrell to Watson, no run","good length and swung in sharply at middle stump, solidly defended on the front foot"
0.1,"Cottrell to Watson, no run",full and swung into the corridor. Jammed into the pitch off the inside half
19.6,"Thakur to Khan, 1 run","low full toss outside off, has a slog and it's miscued. Trickles to long-on's right"
19.5,"Thakur to Maxwell, 1 run","thigh high full toss outside off, backs into the off side and has a swing. Straight to deep midwicket. Square leg was in and he's cross with himself"
19.4,"Thakur to Maxwell, no run","beaten on the reverse-ramp. Low full toss outside off, drops into the leg side and tries to jab this on its way"
19.3,"Thakur to Khan, 1 run","good length slower ball wide outside off, walks into that trying to slap it through cover. Thick outside edge to Dhoni's right and Maxwell calls him through"
19.3,"Thakur to Khan, 1 wide","full and very wide outside off, can't reach that"
19.2,"Thakur to Khan, FOUR runs","jabs it square of third man this time! Full and wide outside off, shuffles around and jams this down to where a conventional third man might have been"
19.1,"Thakur to Khan, FOUR runs",ramped over short third. It's a low full toss on leg stump and he does what everyone does  manipulates the wrists to drag it past his right shoulder and lift it on the off side
18.6,"Bravo to Maxwell, 2 runs","full on leg stump, driven firmly to deep midwicket's left and once again they manage to sneak a second on Jadeja's throw although it may have been a lot closer if the bails had come off one way or another. Khanw as diving"
18.5,"Bravo to Maxwell, FOUR runs","forehand slap over wide mid-off. Slower short ball across him and wide outside off. His front leg is past the tramline on the leg side! He's that far in the leg side, but manages to reach out at this and connects nicely"
18.4,"Bravo to Maxwell, 2 runs","yorker at off stump, shuffles and can only clip this to deep midwicket's left. Sarfraz takes on Jadeja's arm and comes back for the second"

18.2,"Bravo to Khan, no run","yorker length at leg stump, can't get this off the pitch"

17.4,"Thakur to Khan, 1 run","full outside off, patted down to long-off"
17.3,"Thakur to Khan, no run","outside edge fall short of short third man! Another slower ball, good length and just outside off. Looks to drive on the rise"
17.2,"Thakur to Rahul, OUT","taken by Dhoni to his right! Thakur will be on a hat-trick. Full slower ball outside off, wants to jam it behind square on the off side and gets a thick outside edge and that floats off his bat to the keeper's right"
17.1,"Thakur to Pooran, OUT","very very high again  but not far enough. This is a good catch from Jadeja at deep midwicket. That was a juicy ball in the slot at leg stump, right there for the big slog. Big slog is what he does, but he might have fallen over into the off side a touch because he gets under it more than he desires. That must have wobbled but Jadeja waits and waits and then rolls into the turf in relief after taking it"
16.6,"Bravo to Pooran, 1 run","yorker just outside off, jammed down to long-off off the front foot"
16.5,"Bravo to Pooran, 2 runs","short and across him, mistimed chop ends up at long-off"
16.4,"Bravo to Pooran, SIX runs","low full toss on middle stump, weight onto his back leg for a strong base and nice clean slog over wide long-on"
16.3,"Bravo to Pooran, no run","just past leg stump! Pooran walking into the off side a long way, showing the leg stump. This yorker is narrowly past it"
16.2,"Bravo to Pooran, no run","low full toss wide outside off, driven firmly but straight to extra cover"
16.1,"Bravo to Pooran, 2 runs","yorker outside off, jammed into vacant cover. Point is back on the fence so they steal a second"
15.6,"Sam Curran to Pooran, 1 run","slower short ball at middle stump, pulled to deep backward square's right"
15.5,"Sam Curran to Pooran, 2 runs","no power on this one, but they two to long-on's left. Curran outraged with Jadhav who he feels should have attacked that better to his left. Slower short ball, miscued pull. Jadhav is looking for affirmation to his left from deep midwicket and from long-off to his right"
15.4,"Sam Curran to Pooran, no run","short and just outside off, climbs over his attempted hook"
15.3,"Sam Curran to Pooran, SIX runs","ooooof, that is second tier! That is massive. Massive! Goes wide of the crease, drops it short at middle stump, he's leaning back as he pulls and he's tonked it high and far over midwicket. 97 metres is the official count"
15.2,"Sam Curran to Rahul, 1 run","slower short ball just outside off, cut to deep backward point"
15.1,"Sam Curran to Pooran, 1 run","slower short ball just outside off, shuffles and pulls to deep square"

14.5,"Thakur to Rahul, no run","good length on leg stump, flicked straight to short fine"
14.4,"Thakur to Rahul, FOUR runs",past short third man! Short and into the body this time. Walks into the leg side to make room and gets the late cut where he wanted
14.3,"Thakur to Rahul, FOUR runs","whack. To sweeper's right this time. This is poor length from Thakur. Short and wide outside off, and he gets the weight into his half stride and slaughters it"
14.2,"Thakur to Rahul, SIX runs","drilled over long-off for the fifty. Sweeet hit. It's a cross-seam, good length ball, friendly driving length just outside off. And he gets deep in the crease and crunches it"
14.1,"Thakur to Rahul, no run","low full toss on leg stump, driven along the floor to extra cover"
13.6,"Jadeja to Pooran, SIX runs","over deep midwicket. Oh he's come out in good hitting form alright. This is dropped slightly short of a good length, sits up at off stump and he swings cleanly under it with a pull"
13.5,"Jadeja to Pooran, FOUR runs","oh you beauty. Good length, pushed fast and wide across him from around the wicket. That's a decent option from Jadeja, because Pooran has shuffled and seemingly wants to go leg side. Instead he gets laced on the up, over extra cover. That flew off the middle"
13.4,"Jadeja to Rahul, 1 run","short of a good length on leg, punched to long-on's right off the back foot"
13.3,"Jadeja to Pooran, 1 run","good length outside off, walks across off stump and clubs this. Straight to deep midwicket"

12.1,"Bravo to Rahul, no run","short and slower ball, wide outside off. Beaten on the cut"
11.6,"Jadeja to Mandeep, OUT","straight to extra cover.  Full and wide outside off, he's down on one knee and strikes this cleanly. But placed right into Rayudu's lap. He's at the edge of the circle and it dips at a nice height. Mandeep's cameo is done, was hitting them sweetly"
11.5,"Jadeja to Rahul, 1 run","full on leg stump, nicely forward and flicked into the leg side"
11.4,"Jadeja to Rahul, 2 runs","full and just outside off, driven with the turn to long-off's left"

10.6,"Chawla to Mandeep, 1 run","full on middle, leans in and drives to long-on"
10.5,"Chawla to Mandeep, SIX runs","clears deep midwicket. Dropped short, lofted pull. The fielder is in from the circle but that is not an aberration anymore, we've seen all teams do it on these big grounds. That allows Mandeep six"
10.4,"Chawla to Rahul, 1 run","good length at middle, onto the back foot to punch to long-on"
10.3,"Chawla to Mandeep, 1 run","full outside off, driven to extra cover's right. A dive but only parried to long-off"
10.2,"Chawla to Mandeep, SIX runs",swung far over midwicket. That is a delicious sounding slog sweep. Full googly just outside off and he picked that so quickly and was down immediately
10.1,"Chawla to Mandeep, 2 runs","misfield by Faf. Full on off, once again he miscues the inside-out shot to long-off's left and Faf lets that past and they get a second"
9.6,"Jadeja to Rahul, no run","short outside off, mistimed cut towards backward point who fumbles as there's a slight mix up between the batsmen"
9.5,"Jadeja to Mandeep, 1 run","short and in at middle stump, punched to long-on"

8.6,"Chawla to Mandeep, 1 run","good length outside off, wants to go inside-out over extra, miscues and gets it to long-off's left"
8.5,"Chawla to Mandeep, no run","short and just outside off, cut to backward point"
8.4,"Chawla to Mandeep, 2 runs","googly, short and in at middle. Expertly tucked to deep midwicket's left off the back foot"

8.2,"Chawla to Mandeep, 1 run","short and just outside off, punched to long-off off the back foot"
8.1,"Chawla to Agarwal, OUT","taken at deep midwicket. Short and sliding onto middle stump. He's hurried on the pull and was perhaps looking to sit that squarer, because this just looks like catching practice in the end. Chawla strikes immediately"
7.6,"Jadeja to Agarwal, 1 run","short outside off, subdued pull down to long-on. This one sticks in the pitch and turns too"
7.5,"Jadeja to Rahul, 1 run","short outside off, cut to sweeper"
7.4,"Jadeja to Rahul, no run","length at the stumps, tapped into the leg side with the angle"
7.3,"Jadeja to Rahul, no run","short and just outside off, cut to short third"
7.2,"Jadeja to Agarwal, 3 runs",can't get to that at long-off after a big dive to the left. Faf du Plessis sprints to his left and puts a big dive in but it's short of him. Pulls in short of the boundary and sweeper cleans up behind him. Agarwal was looking to drive over extra cover but that ball stuck in the pitch and he got more elevation than strength on this
7.1,"Jadeja to Rahul, 1 run","short and just outside off, punched to long-on off the back foot"
6.6,"Bravo to Rahul, 1 run","overpitched on leg stump, driven along the floor to long-on"
6.5,"Bravo to Rahul, FOUR runs","eases it past point. Errs there, the bowler. Short and wide and at regular pace. He's nicely onto the back foot to put this away"
6.4,"Bravo to Rahul, no run","loopy yorker, slower ball at middle. Looks to drive and gets it off the toe-end"
6.3,"Bravo to Rahul, no run","good length at middle, punched back to the bowler"
6.2,"Bravo to Agarwal, 1 run","good length and just outside off, opens the face and runs it to third man"

6.2,"Bravo to Agarwal, 1 wide","short and down leg side, left alone"
6.1,"Bravo to Rahul, 1 run","good length slower ball on middle stump, allows it on and tucks it to square leg"
5.6,"Thakur to Rahul, 1 run","good length outside off, walks into that and punches to sweeper on the up"
5.5,"Thakur to Rahul, no run","full and just outside off, 137.4kph. Sweetly timed straight drive back at the bowler, who gets a hand on it"

4.6,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","short and into the corridor, can't thread the late cut between short third and backward point"
4.5,"Chahar to Agarwal, 1 leg bye",full slower ball on leg stump. Looks for the flick and cops it on the front pad. Lbw appeal turned down but both bowler and keeper were interested right till the end. Decided against the review. That was sliding down
4.4,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run",good length and slanted in at off stump. Defended to point's right
4.3,"Chahar to Agarwal, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven to mid-on's right and a tumbling stop there"
4.2,"Chahar to Agarwal, FOUR runs","clubbed to the extra cover boundary. Good length ball in the corridor and he walks into the leg side to make room and get this right off the middle, aerially before it runs into the cover boundary"
4.1,"Chahar to Agarwal, no run",good length and just outside off. Defended into the pitch off the front foot
3.6,"Sam Curran to Rahul, FOUR runs",oh lovely wristwork. Full and pushed across the corridor. Leans in and very deliberately opens the face to slice this past backward point
3.5,"Sam Curran to Agarwal, 1 run","full outside off, driven into vacant cover"
3.4,"Sam Curran to Agarwal, FOUR runs","thick outside edge between short third and backward point. Good length ball, a cutter and wide outside off, has a hack at that"
3.3,"Sam Curran to Rahul, 1 run","full and across him, looks to caress through the covers on the front foot, gets an inside edge through square leg"
3.2,"Sam Curran to Agarwal, 1 run","good length and just outside off, pushed into the point region with soft hands"
3.1,"Sam Curran to Rahul, 1 run","full and just outside off, a sweet flowing cover drive but CSK have that area covered with the slip out. A fielder in between mid-off and extra cover, very straight and in especially for these two batsmen who love hitting there"
2.6,"Chahar to Agarwal, no run","short of a length and just outside off, opens the face and finds backward point"
2.5,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","short at middle stump, gets big on him as he looks to punch through midwicket. Inside edge onto thigh and into the off side"
2.4,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","short and wide outside off, under-edge on the attempted late cut"
2.3,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, waits on that and times the cut perfectly. You could see him watch it all the way on and slash it square to beat the sweeper fielder comfortably"
2.2,"Chahar to Rahul, 2 runs",short and into the hips. Stays tall at that and clips it fine. Chawla runs across from long leg and puts in a dive to stop one-handed to his right
2.1,"Chahar to Rahul, no run","good length and just outside off, mistimed punch towards mid-off"
1.6,"Sam Curran to Agarwal, no run","full, wide, and slanted across the corridor. Beaten on the attempted drive"
1.5,"Sam Curran to Rahul, 1 run","full inswinger, 132kph, just outside off. Looks to lean into this and drive through cover but it goes to mid-off off the inside half"
1.4,"Sam Curran to Rahul, no run","good length and swung in at middle stump, hurriedly defended down the pitch"
1.3,"Sam Curran to Rahul, FOUR runs",slashed on the rise. Full and wide outside off. Walks down at it and closes the face on this drive to get it well to sweeper point's right
1.2,"Sam Curran to Agarwal, 1 run",ood length and shaping into off stump. Gets low and opens the face to run this between backward point and short third. Jadeja dives to the left to keep it to one
1.1,"Sam Curran to Agarwal, 2 runs","full and wide outside off, some shape in. Reaches out and drives firmly to sweeper's right. Long, long boundary"
0.6,"Chahar to Agarwal, 1 run","good length, inswinger into the corridor, jabbed to extra cover's left"

0.1,"Chahar to Rahul, 2 runs","short of a good length outside off, some shape away from him. Gets tall and opens the face to run this to deep point's left. Just about steals a second run against a good throw from the deep"

19.5,"Pollard to Rashid Khan, no run","quick and full, between Rashid's legs as his right foot shuffles to off"
19.4,"Pollard to Rashid Khan, no run","wide on the crease, slower ball, beats his slog"
19.3,"Pollard to Rashid Khan, no run","short of a length, pulled to deep midwicket. No single again. Even Sandeep is happy letting Rashid have this net"
19.2,"Pollard to Rashid Khan, no run","on-pace, full, really full, hit down to long-on. Refuses the single"
19.1,"Pollard to Rashid Khan, 2 runs","slower legcutter, short of a length, outside off, hit in front of deep point for two"
18.6,"Bumrah to Sandeep, no run","fast low full toss at the base of the leg stump. Sandeep makes room and saves his toes, and then jams the bat down on it"
18.5,"Bumrah to Abhishek, OUT","looks for a ramp, leaves his stumps exposed, and he hits the middle stump with a seam-up low full toss"
18.4,"Bumrah to Rashid Khan, 1 run",Rashid Khan shuffles across and deep into the crease to place this full ball square of deep midwicket for two
18.3,"Bumrah to Abhishek, 3 leg byes","yorker, outside leg, beats him comprehensively but runs away for leg-byes"

17.1,"Boult to Abhishek, 2 runs","low full toss, into the pads, hit wide of long-on for two"
16.6,"Bumrah to Abdul Samad, FOUR runs","misfielded by Pattinson at deep point. He goes hard at a wide ball, hits it over point, and Pattinson is done in by the ball quickening up after bouncing"
16.5,"Bumrah to Abdul Samad, SIX runs","that is massive. After wide yorkers, Bumrah goes on-pace length, and he goes deep in his crease to hit back over long-off"
16.5,"Bumrah to Abdul Samad, 1 wide",another wide yorker but this time it is too wide
16.4,"Bumrah to Abdul Samad, no run",wide yorker this time. No run as the dig-out goes nowhere

16.1,"Bumrah to Abhishek, no run","slower bouncer, angling across, beats him as he looks to ramp it"

15.5,"Pattinson to Abdul Samad, 1 run","short of a length, stays low, pulled away to deep square leg for one"
15.4,"Pattinson to Warner, OUT","that might be the game. Slower short wide ball legcutter. If Warner doesn't play it, this will be called. But he goes after it, and gets thick outside edge that lobs to the right of short third man where Kishan takes a superb diving catch"
15.3,"Pattinson to Warner, 2 runs",puts this into a hole on the leg side to come back for an easy two
15.2,"Pattinson to Warner, no run",looks for the reverse ramp but is beaten by a Pattinson slower ball on a length outside off
15.1,"Pattinson to Abhishek, 1 run","yorker, just outside off, dug out to mid-off for one"
14.6,"Krunal to Warner, no run","full and wide, away from Warner but manages to kiss that wide line. Not called a wide"

14.4,"Krunal to Abhishek, 2 runs","down the wicket, takes this on the full, hits to the left of deep midwicket, but doesn't have the timing. Gets only two"

14.2,"Krunal to Warner, 1 wide","full, wide yorker. Called a wide"
14.1,"Krunal to Garg, OUT","smart catch by Chahar at deep square leg. Just an example of how small the ground is. This is a terrible mis-hit to a full toss, but the top edge carries to the boundary. Chahar takes his overhead and to his left, and he is a couple of yards off the fence so he can go down and roll safely. The third umpire confirms that"
13.6,"Pollard to Garg, 1 run","Pollard. What fielding. This is hit mighty had back over his head, but the tall man sticks out his big right mitt, and while he can't catch it, he deflects it to long-on. And mind you, he tried to close his hand to catch it. Just a touch too quick for that"
13.5,"Pollard to Warner, 1 run","low full toss, he makes room and drives it to deep cover"
13.4,"Pollard to Warner, no run","slower ball, short of a length, but because he doesn't have the pace, he can't find the gap between point and short third man"
13.3,"Pollard to Garg, 1 run","slower short ball, punched down to long-on for one"
13.2,"Pollard to Garg, 2 runs","wide on the crease, angles a length ball in, pushed just wide of long-on, and Warner pushes Garg for the second. Puts in a big dive to make it"

12.5,"Boult to Garg, 1 run","full toss, on the pads, shovelled to deep square leg"
12.4,"Boult to Warner, 1 run","short of a length, slower, and it falls short of deep midwicket"
12.3,"Boult to Garg, 1 run","on a length, on off, pushed to long-off for one"
12.2,"Boult to Williamson, OUT","this might be the first time Boult has bowled to his NZ captain Williamson in competitive cricket, and he has got him out. Slower bouncer, just sits in front of Williamson's face, and he has picked it late and wants to withdraw from his ramp but is late to do so. It runs off the face of the bat for a catch to de Kock. Just no pace on it to take it away from the keeper"
12.1,"Boult to Warner, 1 run",low full toss as he looks for the yorker. Toe-ended to deep midwicket for one
11.6,"Bumrah to Warner, 1 run","yorker, hit back towards Bumrah who sticks his foot to nearly kick it past mid-off. But Boult does well there. Anyway, the single brings up Warner's fifty"
11.5,"Bumrah to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball, outside off, on a length, pushed to deep cover"
11.4,"Bumrah to Warner, 1 run","high full toss, Warner lets out a grunt as this hits him high on the bat. Single to deep midwicket. Not called a no-ball. Just below the waist so a good call from the umpire"
11.4,"Bumrah to Warner, 1 wide","looks for a yorker, but the line is down the leg side. Wided"
11.3,"Bumrah to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball, legcutter, on a length, at the stumps, pushed to long-on for one"
11.2,"Bumrah to Warner, 1 run","full, on off, hit straight to mid-off for just the single"
11.1,"Bumrah to Warner, no run","big back lift, and then checks the shot because of a slower ball. Hit straight to mid-off"

10.5,"Krunal to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length, straight, pushed down to long-on for one"

10.3,"Krunal to Warner, FOUR runs","full, looking to jam it against the bottom of his bat, but errs by a few inches. Warner lofts him back over his head for a four"
10.2,"Krunal to Warner, SIX runs","and he bowls the Jadhav-like super round-arm delivery again. This is short and sits up. Warner stands his ground, waits for it, and lofts this over long-on for an easy six"
10.1,"Krunal to Warner, 2 runs","short, wide, Warner reaches out to hit this wide of long-off where a Pollard dive keeps them to two"
9.6,"Pattinson to Williamson, no run","short of a length, outside off, played with an open face to point"
9.5,"Pattinson to Pandey, OUT","that is a nothing shot out of nowhere. Length ball outside off, on-pace, and he decides to go in the air but there is no anger behind the shot. When you go in the air, when long-off is back, pack a punch in the hit. He has chipped it straight to the man"
9.4,"Pattinson to Warner, 1 run","short of a length, into the hip, can only tuck it away for one"
9.3,"Pattinson to Pandey, 1 run","slower ball, full, on the pads, driven to deep midwicket for one"
9.3,"Pattinson to Pandey, 1 wide","wide down the leg side. Pandey could have looked to hit for a six too, but he takes the wide"
9.2,"Pattinson to Warner, 1 run","short of a length again, but this time he cramps Warner up. Only a single to deep midwicket"
9.1,"Pattinson to Warner, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Short of a length, pretty straight, but the angle gives him just that little bit of width to guide this between short third and point. Replay of how he welcomed Bumrah to the crease"
8.6,"Chahar to Warner, 1 run",pulled down to wide long-on for one
8.5,"Chahar to Warner, no run","wide short delivery, and would have been a wide had Warner not reached out and toe-ended it for a dot"
8.4,"Chahar to Warner, 2 runs","wrong'un, shortens the length too, Warner bunts this into a hole on the leg side and comes back for two"
8.3,"Chahar to Warner, SIX runs","and Warner joins the party. Chahar over-pitches again, and he has cleared the front leg to slog him over long-on. SRH are not out of this"
8.2,"Chahar to Pandey, 1 run","full again, but wide, and Pandey has to reach for it. Ends up chipping to deep cover for one"
8.1,"Chahar to Pandey, SIX runs","and overpitches first up. Pandey doesn't care this is just his first delivery, and clears his front leg to send him to the top of the grandstand behind wide long-on"
7.6,"Pollard to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover"
7.5,"Pollard to Warner, 1 run","on a length, Warner tries to slog, gets a bottom edge and starts running. The ball just about misses the leg stump or he would have been bowled while he was 10 yards down the pitch"

7.4,"Pollard to Pandey, 1 wide",another slower ball that is a wide down the leg side
7.4,"Pollard to Pandey, 1 wide","slower ball again, wide down the leg side"
7.3,"Pollard to Pandey, FOUR runs","H Padnya has dropped a sitter. Blinded by the sun. Slower short ball, Pandey plays the upper-cut, straight to deep point, and Pandya doesn't have too far to run. But he loses the ball in the sun"
7.2,"Pollard to Warner, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, hit hard, on the bounce to deep cover"
7.1,"Pollard to Pandey, 1 run","on a length, straight, pushed down to long-on for one"
6.6,"Krunal to Warner, no run","full and wide, Warner beaten on the drive, and he is not happy that this hasn't been called a wide"
6.5,"Krunal to Pandey, 1 run","goes low, and bowls a round-arm delivery. This is like a quicker, left-arm Kedar Jadhav. worked to leg for one"
6.4,"Krunal to Pandey, no run","high back lift, but Pandya yorks Pandey"
6.3,"Krunal to Pandey, no run","slower to Pandey, tight line, pushed to his left, but Krunal makes the save"

5.6,"Bumrah to Pandey, 1 run","full, angling in, pushed straight of midwicket for one"
5.5,"Bumrah to Pandey, FOUR runs","whoa that is crisp. Just a push to a length ball, but it is timed so superbly it teases mid-on all the way to the boundary. Nothing more than a defensive push"

5.3,"Bumrah to Warner, no run","short of a length, outside off, pushed to cover-point this time"
5.2,"Bumrah to Warner, FOUR runs","gets the width this time. Short of a length, angling wide, and he has punched this between cover-point and extra cover"

4.6,"Boult to Pandey, no run","slower ball again, short of a length, angling in towards off, hit back to Boult"
4.5,"Boult to Pandey, FOUR runs","slower short ball, and Pandey has the time to manoeuvre this short ball and hit in front of deep square leg for four"
4.4,"Boult to Pandey, no run","short of a length, angling in from wide on the crease. Pulled down to mid-on"
4.3,"Boult to Pandey, FOUR runs","Pandey hits a four second ball. Slower offcutter, but too full and he drags it from wide outside off, and goes through mid-on"
4.2,"Boult to Pandey, no run","on a length, wide, he stays leg side of it, and plays it to cover"
4.1,"Boult to Bairstow, OUT","huge wicket. Bairstow is the one hitting big ones here, and he is gone. Slower short ball, Bairstow is deceived and ends up dragging this short ball to deep square leg instead of the vacant midwicket region. H Pandya takes a low catch"
3.6,"Pattinson to Warner, 2 runs","frustration from Warner but the top edge falls safe. Long-on runs to his left, deep square runs to his right, midwicket runs back, but none of the three can make it to the ball"
3.5,"Pattinson to Bairstow, 1 run","on a length, just outside off, runs this to short third for one more"

19.3,"Kaul to Krunal, SIX runs",why bowl length after yorkers have been working? Krunal gets under this slower ball and lofts him over long-on for an easy six
19.2,"Kaul to Pandya, OUT",base of leg stump. This is great stuff by SRH at death. Pandya goes deep into the crease to try to turn a yorker into a half-volley but Kaul sticks to his guns and squeezes this under his bat
19.1,"Kaul to Pollard, 1 run",low low full toss. Good enough execution. Just the single to deep midwicket
18.6,"Natarajan to Pandya, no run",oh the perfect yorker to Pandya who is looking to go deep into the crease to manufacture a length. Natarajan nails it. Dug out back to him. Another lovely over from Natarajan
18.5,"Natarajan to Pollard, 1 run","looks for the wide yorker again, but bowls full enough to deny him an aerial hit. Drilled to long-on for one"
18.4,"Natarajan to Pandya, 1 run","wide yorker, can't do better than hit it straight to deep cover for one"
18.3,"Natarajan to Pandya, FOUR runs","oh just short of a wide yorker, and Pandya gets under it to drive it over point. If you are bowling wide yorkers, you need a deep point or a square third man"
18.2,"Natarajan to Pollard, 1 run","nails the yorker this time, dug out to long-on for one"
18.1,"Natarajan to Pollard, SIX runs","goes for the wide yorker, ends up bowling a full toss, and he smashes this for a flat six over long-off"
17.6,"Sandeep to Pandya, no run","Hits him on the toe with a yorker. Seems like a slower yorker. Big appeal for lbw. Not given. SRH go upstairs. Runs the fingers on it to create the pace deception, which is why Pandya is early into the shot. But this has pitched just outside leg to save Pandya. Well done by the umpire because it is easy to get carried away when a batsman is hit on the toe bang in front of the stumps"
17.5,"Sandeep to Pollard, 1 run","short ball, just outside off, pulled to deep midwicket for one"
17.4,"Sandeep to Pollard, SIX runs","knee high full toss now, and draws a bit of a mis-hit still. However, at Sharjah, this is strong enough. Rashid leaps at deep square leg and sticks his hand out, but this clears him"
17.3,"Sandeep to Pandya, 1 run","another low full toss, but he ends up hitting it on the first bounce to deep square leg"
17.2,"Sandeep to Pollard, 1 run","another low full toss, but lower than the last one, and he can't get under it. Single to long-on"
17.1,"Sandeep to Pollard, SIX runs","yorker gone wrong. Low full toss, on the stumps, and easily flicked away for a six over midwicket"
16.6,"Natarajan to Pandya, no run","lovely wide yorker, just inside that blue wide line, and it squeezes past his bat. Lovely comeback from Natarajan after that first-ball six"
16.5,"Natarajan to Pollard, 1 run","full and straight, Pollard can't get under it. Only a single"
16.4,"Natarajan to Pandya, 1 run","near yorker, outside off, driven to extra cover for one"
16.3,"Natarajan to Pollard, 1 run","full toss outside off, hit straight to extra cover off the toe end"
16.2,"Natarajan to Pandya, 1 run","misses the yorker, is drilled to long-off for one"
16.1,"Natarajan to Pandya, SIX runs","well this is why. Natarajan comes back, thinks he has bowled a good short ball, and dismissively Pandya pulls it over midwicket for a six"
15.6,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, no run",lovely slow legbreak. Pollard is not taking any risks either. Just the two off the last Rashid over. They want to be in the middle for other overs so no risks against him
15.5,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, no run","another wrong'un, wide outside off, defended off the front foot"
15.5,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, 1 wide","googly, but it starts too straight, and is a wide down the leg side"
15.4,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, no run","quick, flat, straight, defended to leg"
15.3,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, 1 run","finds the single now to bring Pollard on strike. Soft hands, into the leg side"
15.2,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run","flat, quick legbreak, pushed back to him. Pandya doesn't want to take risks against Rashid, but he needs to get a a single at least"
15.1,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run","tossed up outside off, defended off the front foot"
14.6,"Sandeep to Ishan, OUT","sensational catch but he has taken out Kishan. Might not be the smartest thing to do with Pollard to follow. Jokes aside, though, this is an amazing catch. Slower ball from Sharma, and he hits it flat and straight of long-on, but Pandey puts in a full length dive to catch it even as it is dying on him"
14.5,"Sandeep to Pandya, 1 run",hit powerfully down to long-on for one
14.4,"Sandeep to Pandya, FOUR runs","wide on the crease, Pandya shuffles wide too, Sharma bowls wide, Pandya drives to the left of Pandey at long-off, and misfields to add to his drop earlier in the innings"
14.3,"Sandeep to Pandya, SIX runs","difficult chance but dropped. Warner at long-on leaps full length, but it doesn't stick. Harsh to call it a drop. Pandya looks to go downtown, mis-hits it towards long-on, but he has got enough for Sharjah"
14.2,"Sandeep to Ishan, 1 run","slower offcutter, pitches outside leg, turns towards off, worked to leg for one"
14.1,"Sandeep to Pandya, 1 run","on a length, outside off, punched down to long-on"
13.6,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, 1 run","full, outside off, a misfield by the diving extra cover allows him a single"
13.5,"Rashid Khan to Pandya, no run","beaten. Legbreak, tossed up outside off, Pandya pushes in defence, beaten by the turn"
13.4,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 1 run","tossed up wide outside off, driven to long-off for one"
13.3,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, no run","wrong'un, short of a length, the turn takes it away from his reach, and he ends up playing it back to him"
13.2,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, SIX runs","Kishan goes after Rashid. Gets just the right length for the slog-sweep, and he goes with it, sending him over midwicket"
13.1,"Rashid Khan to de Kock, OUT","and it will stay at Faf's 72* for now. Googly from Rashid, de Kock looks to pull this for a six that would take him to 73 but it gets big on him and gets a thick top edge towards midwicket. Rashid runs to the circle, gets under it, and catches a swirler"
12.6,"Kaul to Ishan, no run","slower offcutter, 114ks, pitches on off and cuts away to beat his slog"
12.5,"Kaul to de Kock, 1 run","soft hands, dabbed towards the keeper and off they go for a single"
12.4,"Kaul to de Kock, SIX runs","length ball, gentle medium pace, on the pads, and de Kock lofts this for another flat six. Meat and drink for him"
12.3,"Kaul to de Kock, no run","yorker, on off, dug out back to him"
12.2,"Kaul to de Kock, FOUR runs","makes it look easy. Shuffles across, gets inside the line of a short-of-a-length ball, and then ramps it fine of long leg"
12.1,"Kaul to de Kock, 2 runs","mis-hits the slog off the free hit, gets just the couple to deep midwicket"
12.1,"Kaul to Ishan, (no ball) 1 run","short of a length, outside leg, hit hard to long leg for one. This is a no-ball"
11.6,"Williamson to Ishan, 1 run","cramps him up, goes for a single to long-on"
11.5,"Williamson to Ishan, SIX runs","slower, wider, and Kishan finally gets one out of the crews, hitting him over long-on. Just a touch too full from Williamson"
11.4,"Williamson to de Kock, 1 run","down the wicket again, Williamson goes shorter, draws a bottom edge for one"
11.3,"Williamson to de Kock, SIX runs","finally a boundary in 16 balls. Down the wicket, reaches it pitch, and hits him flat back over his head. Brings up his fifty too"
11.2,"Williamson to Ishan, 1 run","flatter, angled in, punched to long-on for one"
11.1,"Williamson to Ishan, 2 runs","Kishan looks for the slog sweep, but Williamson is slow and just out of his reach. The mis-hit fetches them two wide of long-on"
10.6,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 1 run","flatter, quicker, punched to deep midwicket for one"
10.5,"Rashid Khan to de Kock, 1 run","wrong'un, middle and leg, de Kock looks to work to leg, gets a soft leading edge for a single to mid-off"
10.4,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, 1 run","flatter, middle and leg, worked into the leg side for one"
10.3,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, no run","googly, short, cut away, but straight to cover"
10.2,"Rashid Khan to Ishan, no run","gets some dip, Kishan has to stretch, ends up pushing this back down the wicket, and Rashid makes a diving save"
10.1,"Rashid Khan to de Kock, 1 run","full, middle and leg, pushed to deep midwicket for one"
9.6,"Williamson to de Kock, 1 run","wide outside off, drilled to wide long-on for one"
9.5,"Williamson to Ishan, 1 run","full, really full, can't get under it. Hit hard, but along the ground. Gets a single to deep square"
9.4,"Williamson to de Kock, 1 run","down the wicket, not to its pitch, worked into the leg side for a single"
9.3,"Williamson to Ishan, 1 run","looks for the slog sweep, Williamson keeps the length short of the slot. Concedes just the single to deep midwicket"
9.2,"Williamson to de Kock, 1 run","on a length, just outside off, pushed wide of cover for one"
9.1,"Williamson to de Kock, 2 runs","bottom edge first ball. Nicely flighted outside off. He looks to push, plays for the turn, and the ball skids through. Safe"
8.6,"Abdul Samad to de Kock, 1 run","flat, on a length, worked to leg for one"
8.5,"Abdul Samad to de Kock, FOUR runs","pulled away between wide long-on and midwicket. Pandey runs to his left and is a slide away  from stopping the boundary. However, he is slow to go down and MI get four"
8.4,"Abdul Samad to de Kock, 2 runs","on a length, goes back to work this to leg"
8.3,"Abdul Samad to de Kock, 2 runs","wrong'un, dropped into the leg side for one. And a deflection from the direct hit at the stumps brings them another run"
8.2,"Abdul Samad to de Kock, SIX runs","straight six. Clears the front le, gets down on a knee, and lofts this back over his head"
8.1,"Abdul Samad to Ishan, 1 run","full, middle and leg, drilled down to long-on"
7.6,"Rashid Khan to de Kock, no run","nearly bowled. Tries the reverse sweep, is hot on the forearm, and it rolls towards the stumps. He tries to kick it away but misses. The ball misses the stumps too"

7.1,"Rashid Khan to de Kock, 1 run","flat, legbreak, middle and leg, worked to leg for one"
6.6,"Abdul Samad to de Kock, 1 run",pushed away for a single
6.5,"Abdul Samad to de Kock, SIX runs","dropped. Difficult chance but by Pandey's standards, this is definitely a drop. This is a short ball pulled straight to Pandey at long-on. He has to leap a little for this overhead catch, but ends up parrying it over. Seems he was not sure of how far behind the boundary rope is"
6.4,"Abdul Samad to Ishan, 1 run","Kishan looks to work this wrong'un to leg, but ends up getting a leading edge that falls short of long-off"
6.3,"Abdul Samad to de Kock, 1 run","full, on off, hit wide of long-on, but Pandey is quick and keeps them to one"
6.2,"Abdul Samad to de Kock, 2 runs","full, on the pads, worked towards fine leg with soft hands, and comes back for two"

5.6,"Kaul to Ishan, no run","full and straight, pushed to mid-on"
5.5,"Kaul to Yadav, OUT","how lucky is Kaul? Leg-side filth at 128ks, seems like a floaty slower ball, and the fine leg is up. Yadav seems to have decided to hit this for a six, but plays a little early, and gets a thick edge to short fine leg"
5.4,"Kaul to Yadav, FOUR runs","wide length ball, 126ks, and he doesn't need second invitations to go over extra cover. This is in his slot"
5.3,"Kaul to de Kock, 1 run","full, outside off, squeezed in front of extra cover for one"
5.2,"Kaul to Yadav, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, outside off, punched down the ground, Kaul gets a hand on it, which actually slows the ball down and allows them the time to take a single"
5.1,"Kaul to Yadav, FOUR runs",full toss on the pads with fine leg up. Once again Kaul is lucky Yadav is not looking for a six. Just the four
4.6,"Natarajan to Yadav, 1 run","on a length, angling across, hits the inside half of the bat on the drive"
4.5,"Natarajan to Yadav, no run","another ramp attempted, this time by Surya, and he is beaten. It just misses the leg stump. Well done by the umpire to not call this a wide"
4.4,"Natarajan to de Kock, 1 leg bye","looks for the ramp, Natarajan bowls short of a length, outside off, and de Kock gets a leg-bye off the forearm"
4.3,"Natarajan to de Kock, no run","full, straight, he clears the front leg looking for a big hit, but is hit on the inside half of the bat"
4.2,"Natarajan to de Kock, no run","short of a length, no room, punched to point"
4.1,"Natarajan to de Kock, FOUR runs","full, middle and leg, and he clears the front leg to bludgeon this through mid-on for four"
3.6,"Sandeep to Yadav, no run","shouts of catch it as this stops on him, but the leading edge is wide of the diving Sharma"
3.5,"Sandeep to de Kock, 1 run","short of a length, wide outside off, punched to deep cover"
3.4,"Sandeep to Yadav, 1 run","pulls the length back a touch, pushed down to long-on for one"
3.3,"Sandeep to Yadav, FOUR runs","full, on the pads, 129ks, he is lucky that Yadav has decided to hit just four and not deposit this into the road around the ground"
3.2,"Sandeep to Yadav, no run",this one seems to have swung away a little. Pushed towards mid-off
3.1,"Sandeep to de Kock, 1 run","on a length, outside off, holds its line, dropped into the offside for one"
2.6,"Kaul to Yadav, no run","looks like the slower ball. On a length, outside off, hit back to Kaul"
2.5,"Kaul to Yadav, FOUR runs",slight shimmy to take this on the half-volley and drive it between the bowler and mid-on
2.4,"Kaul to Yadav, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Kaul goes short of a length to deny him the drive, but he is on his toes to punch this on the up, between mid-off and extra cover"
2.3,"Kaul to Yadav, FOUR runs",extension of arms through the line of this length ball with an open face to beat cover. Looks eays in the PP in Sharjah
2.2,"Kaul to de Kock, 1 run","swinging into the pads, but he has a deep square leg in place"
2.2,"Kaul to de Kock, 1 wide","gets some swing, but it starts outside leg and goes further down"
2.1,"Kaul to de Kock, FOUR runs",length ball outside leg with fine leg up. Clipped away for an easy four

1.2,"Natarajan to de Kock, no run","short of a length, outside off, punched to point"

0.5,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, OUT","appeal for a catch at the wicket, not given, and SRH review. Short and wide, pitched just outside the wide line, and Rohit has somehow managed to catch up with the cue end of his bat. A good review from SRH. The decision will have to change, and Rohit will have to walk back"
0.4,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","and Rohit has had enough sighters. Snadeep bowls short at a gentle pace, and Rohit stands tall to pull this over midwicket. Six number 1"
0.3,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","on a length, wide outside off, slight swing back in, patted away to cover again"
0.2,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","slightly short of a length, swings in a touch, pushed to cover"

19.2,"Stoinis to Tripathi, OUT","that's the game then. Dipping slower yorker at 126ks, and it squeezes under Tripathi's swing to dislodge the off stump"
19.1,"Stoinis to Tripathi, FOUR runs","wide low full toss, Tripathi is on a knee and drives with an open face over point. Missing quite a few yorkers, and it is understandable with the dew around"

18.5,"Nortje to Nagarkoti,, 2 runs","short of a length, outside off, a misfield at point allows them to come back for the second"
18.4,"Nortje to Tripathi, 1 run","full toss, again cramps him up, concedes just the single to deep midwicket"
18.3,"Nortje to Morgan, OUT","and Nortje has delivered the big wicket. Morgan gets the pulling length, but this sort of hanfcuffs him with its straight line. Caught at long leg. DC will breathe for now"

17.6,"Rabada to Tripathi, FOUR runs","that over has gone for 23. Yorker gone wrong again. Almost a half-volley, and with mid-off in the circle, he has hit it through mid-off for four more"
17.5,"Rabada to Tripathi, no run","given out caught at the wicket, and Tripathi has reviewed it. Bouncer, at his helmet, Tripathi looks for the hook, and it has missed his bat and just kissed the helmet on the way. So Tripathi has successfully overturned this one"
17.4,"Rabada to Morgan, 1 run","finally gets the yorker right, dug out to long-off for one"
17.3,"Rabada to Morgan, SIX runs","yorker gone wrong, and Rabada has been hit for three successive shots. This is like Cottrell to Tewatia. Three balls in, and Morgan has taken the 18 required off the over. This is a plum full toss, and he has pumped it over deep square leg"
17.2,"Rabada to Morgan, SIX runs","oh this is mayhem. Doesn't matter who you are. If you are bowling in the last four, you have no rights. Slower ball, short of a length, outside leg, picked up over square leg for another six"
17.1,"Rabada to Morgan, SIX runs","that is a massive top edge. What an almighty swing to a bouncer, and the top edge flies fine and sails into the roof"
16.6,"Stoinis to Tripathi, SIX runs","this over keeps KKR alive. A third six to end it off with. Another wide low full toss, Tripathi gets on a knee and lofts this over extra cover"

15.1,"Rabada to Tripathi, 1 run","yorker, middle and leg, dug out to extra cover for one"
14.6,"Patel to Morgan, no run","another slower full toss, this one dips enough to not be a no-ball again. Morgan gets just a bottom edge through to the keeper"
14.6,"Patel to Morgan, (no ball)","slower ball, high full toss, taken at point, but this is bound to a no-ball as it looks like a high full toss. Replays confirm this is a no-ball"

12.5,"Patel to Karthik, OUT","two in two with a diving catch from Dhawan at mid-off. Harshal digs this in, but bowls the change-up, the quick delivery at 133ks. Karthik is late into the pull, and gets a top edge to the right of mid-off, but Dhawan dives full length to take the catch"
12.4,"Patel to Rana, OUT","what a comeback from Harshal Patel. Shortens the length here with this slower ball. Rana looks to go over midwicket this time, but gets a massive top edge for substitute fielder Axar Patel to take the catch at deep midwicket"

9.2,"Rabada to Russell, FOUR runs","short ball, slower one, 125ks, Russell waits for it, sets up his base, and smashes this down the ground and straight of long-on"
9.1,"Rabada to Russell, no run","goes for the yorker, ends up bowling a quick full toss. Defended back to him"
8.6,"Mishra to Russell, 1 run","Mishra stays away from Russell's swinging arc. Short ball, wide, and hit hard down to long-on"
8.5,"Mishra to Rana, 1 run","slider, short wide outside off, punched down to long-off for one"
8.4,"Mishra to Rana, SIX runs","and h takes six off that free hit. Mishra bowls a full legbreak, Rana gets right behind it and crashes it back over his head"
8.4,"Mishra to Russell, (no ball) 1 run","big wind-up, but Mishra is slow and gets the ball to dip. Punched to deep cover for one. But this is a no-ball"
8.3,"Mishra to Rana, 1 run","legbreak, middle and leg, pushed to leg for one"
8.2,"Mishra to Russell, 1 run","short of a length, stays low, hit hard to long-on for one"
8.1,"Mishra to Gill, OUT",Gill is not only out to a skier he refuses to cross. This is ordinary bating. Digging a hole with slow strike before trying the slow sweep against the turn off Mishra. The big top edge goes straight up for a mile and settles with Pant
7.6,"Ashwin to Rana, FOUR runs",and he fails to edd the over well. Provides him width on this length ball without a deep point. Is cut away precisely there
7.6,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 wide",fired down the leg side for a wide
7.5,"Ashwin to Gill, 1 run","legbreak, short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover for one"
7.4,"Ashwin to Gill, 2 runs","carrom ball? Short of a length, turning the other way, runs away off the thick outside edge. Clears point"
7.3,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run","on a length, outside off, cut straight to cover-point where substitute fielder Rahane misfields"
7.2,"Ashwin to Gill, 1 run","slow offbreak, short of driving length, punched to deep cover"
7.1,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run","slow, offbreak, Rana goes back to cut it for a single to deep cover"

6.5,"Mishra to Rana, no run","slower, fuller, dug out back to him"
6.4,"Mishra to Rana, no run","slider, short of a length. Rana cuts but he doesn't have the pace to work with. Hits this to point"
6.3,"Mishra to Rana, no run","dropped. Slider from Mishra, Rana gets a leading edge as he looks to the leg side. Mishra has to dive to his right, but this is not that difficult a catch. Spills it"
6.2,"Mishra to Gill, 1 run","down the wicket, Mishra goes wide, making him drag it to long-on for one"
6.1,"Mishra to Gill, no run","leading edge first up. Slow legbreak, starts from leg, and lands in front of point after hitting his edge"
5.6,"Patel to Gill, 1 run","low full toss, on the pads, worked away for one to deep square"
5.5,"Patel to Rana, 1 run","full and fast, and he concedes a single to the man he just pushed back: deep square leg"
5.4,"Patel to Rana, no run","another offcutter, this time he starts on a length and outside leg. Beats his push"
5.3,"Patel to Rana, FOUR runs","slower ball again, nearly a yorker, and goes for four. Is this done deliberately? He is looking to open the face, but the ball has run off the edge of the bat, between the keeper and short third"
5.2,"Patel to Rana, FOUR runs","another slower ball, Rana slogs at it, gets a thick edge, and it flies over short third. That's why they ask you to swing hard if you are swinging"
5.1,"Patel to Gill, 1 run","on a length, outside off, punched to mid-off for one"
5.1,"Patel to Gill, 1 wide","slower ball first up, wide down the leg side"
4.6,"Stoinis to Rana, no run","offcutter to draw a dot to end the over. Just short of a length, and beats his push in front of off"
4.5,"Stoinis to Gill, 1 run","short ball, at off, draws a bottom edge on the pull for a single to mid-on"
4.4,"Stoinis to Rana, 1 run",steered to deep point for one
4.3,"Stoinis to Gill, 1 run","down the wicket, Stoinis tucks him up with a shortish delivery. Concedes a single to midwicket"
4.2,"Stoinis to Gill, FOUR runs","short, at 134ks, and Gill delays the pull slightly to place this square of the deep square leg. He doesn't have far to go to his right, but can't stop this"
4.1,"Stoinis to Rana, 1 run","on a length, no room, he runs it down to deep point for one"
3.6,"Nortje to Gill, no run","short of a length, quick, hits him high on the bat. Played to cover-point"
3.5,"Nortje to Gill, no run","runs his fingers on it? Pace is 134ks. Yes this is a legcutter, which stays low and squeezes under his bat outside off"
3.4,"Nortje to Gill, SIX runs",top edge on the pull but he has placed this in front of square so there is no boundary rider. He gets a small six for this
3.3,"Nortje to Rana, 1 leg bye","short of a length, quick, hits the thigh pad, concedes a leg-bye"
3.2,"Nortje to Gill, 1 run","pulls the length ball a little, is punched to mid-off for one"
3.1,"Nortje to Gill, FOUR runs","Gill lines Nortje up. Shuffles across to get behind the line of this length ball and goes over mid-off. Even though he gets more height than distance, it is good enough to clear mid-off"
2.6,"Ashwin to Rana, SIX runs","pause plus round arm. Rana just waits for it, and pings this ball back over long-on for another six"
2.5,"Ashwin to Gill, 1 run","another pause in his delivery stride. Bowls middle and leg, makes him play to his deep fielder, midwicket"
2.4,"Ashwin to Rana, 1 run","fuller, slower, on the pads, worked to leg for one"
2.3,"Ashwin to Rana, no run","pauses in his delivery stride, bowls flat, outside off, cut to cover-point"
2.2,"Ashwin to Rana, SIX runs",what a welcome back. Doesn't bother with any sighters. Slog-sweeps this length ball from around off. Clean connection
2.1,"Ashwin to Gill, 1 run","length-ball offbreak, worked to leg for one"
1.6,"Nortje to Rana, no run","on a length, around off, defended from the crease"
1.5,"Nortje to Gill, 1 run","nearly a run-out. Gill runs after hitting to mid-off, and he is casual in trying to make it. Iyer has nearly caught him off guard but misses the stumps. He is gone if Iyer hits"
1.4,"Nortje to Rana, 3 runs","a length ball on the pads, clipped to the vast open spaces in the leg side for, you'd better believe, a three at Sharjah"
1.3,"Nortje to Rana, no run","on a length, straight, wicket to wicket, defended back to him"
1.2,"Nortje to Narine, OUT","there he goes. Not the attack to try Narine against. The good thing is, he hasn't wasted too many balls. Clears the front leg and slogs, Nortje hits the top of leg stump"
1.1,"Nortje to Narine, 4 byes","sharp bouncer, aimed at the helmet, but it keeps flying as it goes past him. Goes for four byes"
0.6,"Rabada to Narine, 1 run","back to pace, played with an open face for a single to point"
0.5,"Rabada to Narine, 2 runs","and just as I say this attack is too quick and big for Narine, Rabada bowls a 119ks slower ball, which Narine punches through point"
0.4,"Rabada to Narine, no run","this is not the attack to try Narine against. Sharp heavy short ball, beats him as he fends without getting close to the line of the ball"
0.3,"Rabada to Gill, 1 run","stays short of a length, Gill gets inside its line, takes a single to leg"
0.2,"Rabada to Gill, no run","short of a length, again, cramps him up with the angle. Pushed to mid-on"
0.1,"Rabada to Gill, no run","short of a length, just outside off, punched to cover"
19.6,"Russell to Hetmyer, 1 run","yorker, dug out to long-off for just the single. I am surprised they don't go for the extra run"
19.5,"Russell to Hetmyer, no run","this is excellent bowling. Beats him with an on-pace short ball. Appeals for a catch at the wicket. Not given. They review, looking for a bottom edge here. Nothing on the UltraEdge"
19.4,"Russell to Hetmyer, no run","slower ball, short of a length, beats his pull"
19.3,"Russell to Hetmyer, SIX runs",Hetmyer has mis-hit this slower ball for a six that lands short of the dugout. Opens up his front leg and lofts it down the ground
19.2,"Russell to Hetmyer, no run","Hetmyer looks for a six first up, and is beaten by a quick bouncer"
19.1,"Russell to Stoinis, OUT","slower ball, wide down leg, but Stoinis thinks he can clear short midwicket and take four. However, he ends up toe-ending this for a catch at short fine leg"
18.6,"Varun to Iyer, SIX runs","legcutter goes too full, and Iyer gets inside the line for another head-down six off another spinner. Sweet as"
18.5,"Varun to Stoinis, 1 run","stays short of a length, doesn't allow him a free hit down the ground. Hit to long-off for one"
18.4,"Varun to Iyer, 1 run","slow through the air, gets some dip, beats him in the air. Gets hit on the inside half on the slog"
18.3,"Varun to Iyer, SIX runs","flat, short of a length, outside off, and he stands tall to hit it over extra cover for a flat six"
18.2,"Varun to Iyer, 2 runs","really slow offbreak, and Karthik can't collect it down the leg side as it beats Iyer's swing. Or did he get a bottom edge?"
18.1,"Varun to Iyer, FOUR runs","short of a length, flat, outside off, pulled between long-on and deep midwicket for four"
17.6,"Russell to Stoinis, no run",looks to ramp a bouncer even while ducking. Makes no connection
17.5,"Russell to Pant, OUT",oh he tries the helicopter and it crash-lands in the lap of long-on. Russell cramps him up with a full ball on the pads. Pant has to draw any power from that whip of the wrists. He doesn't succeed. Long-on takes the catch
17.4,"Russell to Pant, FOUR runs","full toss, and he has mis-hit it. And still it is placed between wide long-on and deep midwicket"
17.3,"Russell to Pant, FOUR runs","short ball, hurrier him into the pull, but he also gets inside the line to be able to use the pace and place it square on the leg side for four"
17.2,"Russell to Pant, SIX runs",Pant is only getting started here. Russell makes the mistake of bowling length. Pant is not holding himself back. Sends this to the roof behind wide long-on
17.1,"Russell to Iyer, 1 run","and he draws a mis-hit immediately. Not a yorker, but not quite a half-volley. So he can't get under it properly. Takes a single to deep cover"
16.6,"Cummins to Iyer, 1 run","full toss, just outside off, played to deep midwicket for one"
16.5,"Cummins to Iyer, FOUR runs",Cummins has mid-off up and Iyer backs away to drive a full delivery between mid-off and extra cover
16.4,"Cummins to Iyer, FOUR runs","oh nearly a yorker, but Iyer gets inside its line and manages to play it towards short fine where an awkward bounce draws four runs from Narine"
16.3,"Cummins to Pant, 1 run","full, outside off, drilled hard to the left of deep cover, but they get just the single"
16.2,"Cummins to Iyer, 1 run",this time the yorker lands. Just the single to leg
16.1,"Cummins to Iyer, SIX runs",yorker gone wrong. Iyer likes the consequent low full toss. He hits this metres above the midwicket boundary
15.6,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, FOUR runs",there is a deep midwicket in place but Pant has drilled this full ball between long-on and that man. No chance for either fielder
15.5,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, FOUR runs","that is a Pant special. Slower bouncer, outside off, and he somehow smashes this over extra cover where there is no fielder"
15.4,"Shivam Mavi to Iyer, 1 run",dug out to deep midwicket for one
15.3,"Shivam Mavi to Iyer, FOUR runs","misfielded at the fence to undo a good delivery. Mavi stays full enough - even though not quite the yorker - to deny him a free hit. Iyer sends it to long-on, where Cummins lets the bowler down. That's Iyer's fastest fifty in IPL"
15.2,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, 1 run","fuller, doesn't allow him elevation. Hit to long-off for one"
15.1,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, FOUR runs","Bang. Pant has warmed up. A nothing length-ball loosener outside off, and he has smashed it straight of mid-off"
14.6,"Nagarkoti, to Pant, 1 run",the straight yorker executer now. Dug out for just the single
14.6,"Nagarkoti, to Pant, 1 wide",low full toss but he has angled it too far wide outside off
14.6,"Nagarkoti, to Pant, 1 wide","wide full toss, called wide. Borderline on height too, but he gets away with that one"
14.5,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, 1 run","yorker, h can't get under it. Takes a single to long-on"
14.4,"Nagarkoti, to Pant, 1 run","absolutely smashes away as he gets width on a length ball, but he has hit this straight to extra cover. An unnecessary throw from Morgan gives them the single"
14.3,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, 1 run",played down the ground for a single
14.2,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, 2 runs","short of a length, no room, punched straight of deep midwicket for two"
14.1,"Nagarkoti, to Pant, 1 run","on a length, outside off, driven on the up, with an open face. Gets a single to deep point"
13.6,"Cummins to Iyer, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Cummins gets a touch too full, and he drives it over extra cover for four more"
13.5,"Cummins to Pant, 1 run","full and wide, driven to deep cover for one"
13.4,"Cummins to Iyer, 1 run","on a length, pretty straight, cross seam, played to deep square leg for one"
13.3,"Cummins to Pant, 1 run","short of a length, wicket to wicket, punched down the ground for one"
13.2,"Cummins to Pant, 2 runs","full and straight, clipped between square leg and deep midwicket for two more"
13.1,"Cummins to Pant, 2 runs","on a length, mis-hit towards long leg, and he scampers back for two. Gets a dive in for good measure"
12.6,"Nagarkoti, to Pant, 1 run","nearly run out first ball. Short of a length, no room, the bottom hand comes off as he pushes to point. He is short by miles but the throw doesn't hit at the non-striker's end"
12.5,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, 1 run",backs away to open the face on this short-of-a-length delivery for a single
12.4,"Nagarkoti, to Shaw, OUT","Nagarkoti finally gets some reward too. Short of a length, follows Shaw as he makes room, and this one flies over the toe end of the bat. Goes a mile in the air but can't clear long-on"
12.3,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, no room, worked to leg for one"
12.2,"Nagarkoti, to Shaw, 1 run","back of a length, angling in, punched down to long-on"
12.1,"Nagarkoti, to Shaw, SIX runs","soft little pick-up shot, and six more. Full toss, middle and leg, and Shaw goes over midwicket with this"
11.6,"Varun to Iyer, FOUR runs","this time he gives Iyer width with the flatter delivery, and he rocks back to cut it between short third and point"
11.5,"Varun to Iyer, no run","flatter, quicker, shorter. Cramps him up"
11.4,"Varun to Iyer, SIX runs","head-down six. Gets the big stride in, not right to its pitch, but close enough to swing through the line and go over long-on"
11.3,"Varun to Shaw, 1 run","slips this in wide and flat, draws a bottom edge on the cut as Shaw has backed away early"
11.2,"Varun to Shaw, FOUR runs","no justice in Sharjah. Plays for the offbreak, gets an outside edge to this legcutter, and it flies fine of short third man"
11.1,"Varun to Iyer, 1 run","looks like an offbreak, goes away after pitching, Dropped in front of point for one"
10.6,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, 1 run","gets away with a similar delivery, this time it is flicked for a single to deep backward square"
10.5,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, SIX runs","just a soft little pick-up shot, and he gets six for it. He shuffles across to clip this leg-side length ball over deep square"
10.4,"Nagarkoti, to Shaw, 1 run","yorker gone wrong. Low full toss, hit to deep midwicket for one"
10.3,"Nagarkoti, to Shaw, SIX runs","slower ball, 118ks, on a length, outside off, and Shaw delays his slog to send it over long-on and bring up his fifty"
10.2,"Nagarkoti, to Iyer, 1 run","on a length, straight, whipped to deep midwicket"
10.1,"Nagarkoti, to Shaw, 1 run","lovely yorker to start off with, 141ks, following him, jamming his bat outside leg"
9.6,"Narine to Shaw, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched into the leg side"
9.5,"Narine to Iyer, 1 run","full, driven hard, gets a thick inside edge for one"
9.4,"Narine to Shaw, 1 run","stays short of a length, outside off, cut away to deep point"
9.3,"Narine to Iyer, 1 run","offbreak, short of a length, punched down to long-on for one"
9.2,"Narine to Iyer, SIX runs","Iyer finally gets spin, and he unleashes. Not quite to the pitch of the ball, which is why he ends up dragging it to midwicket, but gets a good enough connection"
9.1,"Narine to Shaw, 1 run","on a length, on off, punched down to long-on"
8.6,"Russell to Iyer, no run",bouncer to end the over. Iyer does nothing to it. Two overs without a boundary for Russell. This is excellent
8.5,"Russell to Shaw, 1 run","another near-yorker. A low full toss hit to mid-off for a tight single, and Shaw is hit on the foot by the throw and is down on his haunches. A direct hit would have got Shaw here"
8.4,"Russell to Shaw, no run","full, slightly short of being a yorker, but Shaw can't beat mid-off here"
8.3,"Russell to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, gets big on him, dropped into the leg side for one"
8.2,"Russell to Shaw, 1 run","full, slight swing, hits the outer half of the bat for a single to extra cover"
8.1,"Russell to Shaw, no run","gets some swing, which means he can't get all of this low full toss. Hit straight to extra cover"
7.6,"Shivam Mavi to Iyer, FOUR runs","on a length, outside off, driven on the up, hard and between the bowler and mid-off"
7.5,"Shivam Mavi to Shaw, 1 run","on a length, but no room this time. Pushed with soft hands, and they take a single to cover"
7.4,"Shivam Mavi to Shaw, SIX runs",lovely shot. First boundary after the fifth over. Makes room to loft this length ball inside-out over extra cover
7.3,"Shivam Mavi to Iyer, 1 run","on a length, outside off, played on the up, gets a single to mid-off"
7.2,"Shivam Mavi to Shaw, 1 run","short of a length, Shaw gets inside the line and helps it along to long leg for one"
7.1,"Shivam Mavi to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, worked to deep square leg for one"
6.6,"Russell to Shaw, no run",yorker. Dub out back to him. Excellent over. No boundary
6.5,"Russell to Iyer, 1 run","shuffles across, then backs away. Russells stays short and straight. He ramps him to third man for one"
6.4,"Russell to Shaw, 1 run","on a length, just outside off, punched to deep midwicket for one"
6.3,"Russell to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, just outside off, pushed straight to cover and they scamper through for one"
6.2,"Russell to Iyer, no run","legcutter. Great ball to get a dot here. Short of a length, just outside off, holds its line, beats his defensive shot"
6.1,"Russell to Shaw, 1 run","short, on off, pulled to deep midwicket for one"
5.6,"Varun to Shaw, 1 run","legcutter again, short of a length, not much room, cut away in front of square for one"
5.5,"Varun to S Dhawan, OUT","legcutter grip but a topsinner, and Dhawan is done in. Brave bowling. Tosses this up, but gets some drop in it, and the extra bounce gets a big top edge on the sweep. The ball swirls and swirls and Morgan does well to hold on to it at square leg"
5.4,"Varun to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length, skids through to beat his pull"
5.3,"Varun to Shaw, 1 run","down the wicket, not to the pitch of the ball, plays this to deep midwicket for one"
5.2,"Varun to Shaw, no run","tossed up wide, Shaw tries the big sweep, but is beaten"
5.1,"Varun to Shaw, FOUR runs","short of a length, seems like the legbreak, cut away between cover and cover-point"
4.6,"Narine to Shaw, 1 run","again the big wind-up, and again he stays out of the swinging arc. Punched down to long-on for one"
4.5,"Narine to Shaw, no run","appeal for lbw as Narine beats him on the slog with the offbreak, but this is headed down leg. Nice dip on it"
4.4,"Narine to S Dhawan, 1 run","carrom ball, short of a length, outside off, placed in front of point for one"
4.3,"Narine to S Dhawan, SIX runs","more of a slog-sweep this time, and the result is the same. Clean as. Why would you want to be a bowler? This is a perfect length for an offbreak, but this is Sharjah"
4.2,"Narine to S Dhawan, SIX runs","big sweep. Dhawan early to plonk the foot down, get down on a knee, and sweep this length-ball offbreak in the air and out of the ground"
4.1,"Narine to Shaw, 1 run","big wind up against this offbreak, but it dips and drops short of the slot. So he works it to leg for one"
3.6,"Varun to S Dhawan, no run","full, but slow and dipping, slight turn away from him. Defended back to the bowler"
3.5,"Varun to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","lovely inside-out shot. Not a big drive, just a jab at it. He has finally got one full, and he goes over extra cover"

2.6,"Cummins to Shaw, 1 run","short of a length, just outside off, soft hands are back, and they take a single to cover"
2.5,"Cummins to Shaw, SIX runs","goes for a proper short ball, at 148ks, but this rises to as high as his ribs. Pulled away with disdain. The first six of many tonight"
2.4,"Cummins to Shaw, FOUR runs","Slightly shorter than the usual short of a length, and that allows Shaw, a short man, the time to pull this over midwicket"

18.4,"Unadkat to AB, 1 run","slower ball, good length and at off stump. Punched to extra cover's left. Smith collects one-handed, throws at the non-striker's end and the man backing up fumbles it"

18.2,"Unadkat to Kohli, 3 runs","falls short of long-off. Slower short ball outside off, looks to jab it to the extra cover boundary. Miscues and lobs it up for the diving fielder.

18.1,"Unadkat to AB, 1 run","good length and in at middle stump, turned towards square leg with soft hands"
17.6,"Tom Curran to Kohli, FOUR runs","oh wow. Lovely placement. Slower ball, short and wide outside off. Fetches it with perfect  timing to get the pace and beat fine leg to his left"
17.5,"Tom Curran to Kohli, FOUR runs","slashed over short third. Slower ball, short and very wide. No attempt to be aesthetic there. Kohli chucks the hands with the intent to get it over the fielder. It is over him off the thick outside edge"

16.2,"Gopal to AB, 1 run","full legbreak outside off, slashes a drive out to sweeper"
16.1,"Gopal to Kohli, 1 run","googly, good length and in at off stump. Opens the face and dabs it to point"
15.6,"Archer to AB, no run","full toss at off stump, tapped back down the pitch"
15.5,"Archer to Padikkal, OUT","knocks off stump out with a 145kph ball. Padikkal walking into the leg side again expecting a short one, but this is full. Archer too smart for him, but it's the end of yet another impressive innings from the 20-year-old"
15.4,"Archer to Kohli, 1 bye","beaten and so is Buttler. Archer has his hands on his hips. Full slower ball wide outside off, 121.6kph. Looks to whip that over midwicket. Buttler can't collect cleanly on the bounce and they sneak a run"
15.3,"Archer to Kohli, no run",short ball in the corridor. Gets steep and he lets that go
15.2,"Archer to Padikkal, 1 run","good length and just outside off, mistimed slog to long-on"
15.1,"Archer to Padikkal, FOUR runs","past third man to his left. Short and at middle stump. Not doing too well with the pull against Archer, so this time he jumps into the leg side to open the off side instead. Smart batting. Slashes it over backward point"
14.6,"Tewatia to Padikkal, 1 run","short and wide, dragged clumsily down to long-on with the pull"
14.5,"Tewatia to Kohli, 1 run","full toss on middle stump, punches it down to long-on and brings up his fifty. Got the time to play himself in today and he's used it after an indifferent start to the season"
14.4,"Tewatia to Kohli, SIX runs",sweeeeet. Pristine. Full and quicker at middle stump. Jumps down and is right by the pitch of it. Clean straight swing
14.3,"Tewatia to Kohli, no run","full on off stump, driven on the bounce to extra cover"
14.2,"Tewatia to Kohli, 2 runs","dropped. Tough return catch for Tewatia, that was drilled to his left, just above head height. Full ball outside off. Long-off gets across to it, to his right"
14.1,"Tewatia to Padikkal, 1 run","short and wide outside off. Looks to muscle it through the off side, gets a thick inside edge to long-on"
13.6,"Archer to Padikkal, 1 run",just short of midwicket. Struggling to get the pull away against Archer's pace. He  plays that shot compulsively and will be tested more and more with every passing game. This time he slices it a few yards in front of Samson
13.5,"Archer to Padikkal, no run",short and rising too quickly at middle stump. Backs away to pull but that's ended up at mid-off
13.4,"Archer to Padikkal, no run","bouncer at leg stump, 137.2kph, ducks under it"
13.3,"Archer to Kohli, 1 run","short of good length outside off, another mistimed pull. This time because it's a short ball. Mid-on covers to his right"
13.2,"Archer to Kohli, no run","short outside off, mistimed pull to midwicket off the inside half"
13.1,"Archer to Padikkal, 1 run","good length and just outside off, mistimed drive on the rise to mid-off's right"
12.6,"Parag to Kohli, no run","good length, coming in from outside off. Hurriedly defended on the front foot"
12.6,"Parag to Padikkal, 2 wide","full googly down leg side, gets low for the paddle sweep and misses. Buttler can't gather cleanly"
12.5,"Parag to Kohli, 1 run","short of a good length at middle, mistimed pull to long-on"
12.4,"Parag to Kohli, no run","good length offbreak this time, at middle stump. Pushed into midwicket"
12.3,"Parag to Kohli, SIX runs","whipped over extra cover. Full and just outside off. Parag doesn't bowl legbreaks as much as legcutters, so there won't be much grip on his deliveries. Kohli goes inside-out over extra cover"
12.2,"Parag to Kohli, FOUR runs","steps out and slaps it on the up. Peak Kohli. Short of a good length and wide outside off. Kohli will enjoy Parag's bowling, because he skids it on. And this skids on and sits up and he gets it on the rise to the wide long-off boundary"
12.1,"Parag to Kohli, no run","good length and sliding in from outside off, chopped to short third man"
11.6,"Unadkat to Padikkal, no run","slower short ball just outside off, backs away and cuts straight to backward point"
11.5,"Unadkat to Kohli, 1 run","slower good length ball at middle, flicked to deep midwicket"
11.4,"Unadkat to Padikkal, 1 run","slower short ball at middle stump, pulled to deep square"
11.3,"Unadkat to Padikkal, FOUR runs","third fifty of the season. Slower ball, dug short and turning into the corridor. Allows that one, arches into the leg side to make room and dabs it past the keeper. The timid boy who hung out with 16-year-old Prayas Barman at the airports when RCB traveled between venues last year, is now a guaranteed pick in that top order"
11.2,"Unadkat to Padikkal, 2 runs","short at middle stump, pulled to deep midwicket's left"
11.1,"Unadkat to Kohli, 1 run","good length and across the corridor. Looks to drive on the up, thick inside edge to deep square"
10.6,"Tewatia to Padikkal, no run","googly, short of a good length outside off. Tapped to extra cover"
10.5,"Tewatia to Kohli, 1 run",good length and quickly onto the legs. Punched to long-on off the back foot
10.4,"Tewatia to Padikkal, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut firmly to sweeper's right"
10.3,"Tewatia to Kohli, 1 run","tossed up at leg stump, driven to long-on's left"
10.2,"Tewatia to Kohli, no run","bat-pad situation and an lbw shout. Good length ball slides back in off the pitch at middle and Kohli is a little tangled trying to play a late cut. Tewatia seems convinced that's pad-first. Smith and Buttler, slip and keeper, don't. Ultra Edge shows glove first"
10.1,"Tewatia to Kohli, 2 runs","short and skidding on at leg stump, punched to deep midwicket's right"
9.6,"Gopal to Padikkal, no run",dropped very short and wide outside off. Can't beat extra cover with the cut

9.3,"Gopal to Padikkal, 2 runs","full and quicker on off stump, front-of-the-hand. Neat little flowing drive to long-off's right. Tewatia with another dive and tumble to save runs"

9.1,"Gopal to Padikkal, 1 run","googly, short and at leg stump. Whipped top deep midwicket"

8.3,"Tewatia to Kohli, 1 run","good length at leg stump, flicked to deep square"
8.2,"Tewatia to Kohli, FOUR runs","whippy pull to deep square. Dropped short at middle stump, quickly on the back foot and gets it to deep square's right"
8.1,"Tewatia to Padikkal, 1 run","full and just outside off, squeezed out to sweeper cover"
7.6,"Tom Curran to Kohli, FOUR runs","misfield at extra cover. Very poor work. Full ball outside off, steps out and drives firmly. Great timing on it. But it's straight at the fielder, Lomror, who just doesn't get down on it with the barrier"
7.5,"Tom Curran to Kohli, 2 runs","dropped short, a slower ball outside off. Pulls it over midwicket. Tewatia runs a long way to his left from deep square and puts in a dive to flick this back in"
7.4,"Tom Curran to Kohli, no run","length and at the stumps, clipped to midwicket"
7.3,"Tom Curran to Padikkal, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven along the floor to sweeper cover"

7.1,"Tom Curran to Padikkal, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket's left"
6.6,"Tewatia to Kohli, no run",beaten. Loopy googly tossed up very wide outside off. Reaches out and is beaten on the under edge as he has a whip at that
6.5,"Tewatia to Padikkal, 1 run",short and wide and cut to sweeper's left again
6.4,"Tewatia to Kohli, 1 run",good length and sliding in at middle. Onto the back foot to punch to long-on
6.3,"Tewatia to Kohli, 2 runs",good length and into the pads. Nudged to fine leg's right
6.2,"Tewatia to Kohli, no run",good length and sliding in at leg stump. Flicked to midwicket's left
6.1,"Tewatia to Padikkal, 1 run","short and wide outside off, hammered to sweeper cover off the back foot"
5.6,"Tom Curran to Padikkal, 1 run","just short of long-on running in. Slower ball at a good length, just outside off. Wants to loft it over midwicket, presumably. Archer can't reach it"
5.5,"Tom Curran to Padikkal, FOUR runs",way too short from Curran. And this one is wide too. It's also a slower ball. He waits on it and punches aerially to the extra cover boundary
5.4,"Tom Curran to Padikkal, no run",forced to leave that. Short slower ball going across the corridor. Had shaped for the pull but that just didn't arrive. Decided to drop the bat and let it go
5.3,"Tom Curran to Padikkal, FOUR runs",slower short ball up at the hips. Waits on it and shovels it past short fine
5.2,"Tom Curran to Padikkal, no run","full slower ball on off stump, forced to defend into the covers"
5.1,"Tom Curran to Padikkal, 2 runs","slices the attempted pull and dribbles away safely after landing behind the bowler. Short and going across him, was late on the pull"

4.5,"Gopal to Padikkal, 1 run","short at middle stump, pulled to deep midwicket"
4.4,"Gopal to Kohli, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut firmly to backward point who fumbles. They take the run as he looks to retrieve it"
4.3,"Gopal to Kohli, FOUR runs",easy peasy. That'll feel nice. Googly gets stuck in his hand a little and is very very short and almost looping down on Kohli as it goes down leg. Helps it along to the backward square boundary
4.2,"Gopal to Kohli, no run",good length and coming into him as he shuffles and defends down the pitch
4.1,"Gopal to Padikkal, 1 run","googly, short of a good length outside off. Opens the face and chops to short third's right"
3.6,"Archer to Kohli, no run","good length outside off, 146.3kph, shuffles and taps it on the rise into the covers"

3.3,"Archer to Padikkal, 1 run","good length at middle stump, defended into the covers with soft hands"
3.2,"Archer to Padikkal, FOUR runs","misfield at short fine. Gopal not sharp enough to field low to his left. Short at the hips, stands tall and nudges it. Through from under him"
3.1,"Archer to Padikkal, no run",good length and angled away from middle stump. Deep in the crease as he defends off the outside part of the bat
2.6,"Gopal to Kohli, no run","googly, full and outside off. Reaches out and clips to midwicket"
2.5,"Gopal to Padikkal, 1 run","good length, sliding across the corridor. Punched to long-on off the back foot"
2.4,"Gopal to Kohli, 1 run","googly, short of a good length and wide outside off. Shuffles and whips into midwicket"
2.3,"Gopal to Finch, OUT","caught in front of the stumps trying to sweep. Turned down. Smith reviews. He was looking to paddle this from middle stump, was caught on the thigh. An incoming ball on first glance. Might not be such a bad shout. His front leg is well across the body and into the off side nothing on Ultra Edge till ball hits pad. That is hitting middle and leg. Impact is on off stump. A googly from a good length and he's taken the early wicket. Good bowling and also a good decision to keep staring his captain down with puppy eyes and get that review"
2.2,"Gopal to Finch, FOUR runs","oh he's done this every match, just jump down the leg side. Invariably the first ball against a legspinner, Finch has gone way down leg side, drawn a short ball into him and swatted it past backward square. And he does it again"
2.1,"Gopal to Padikkal, 1 run","good length, googly at leg stump. On the back foot to tap to long-on"
1.6,"Unadkat to Padikkal, 1 run","good length on middle stump, taps it to mid-on"

1.3,"Unadkat to Padikkal, FOUR runs","short of a good length and just outside off. That is a decent length on most days, but today there is more time on such balls as we saw all of the first innings. Front foot pull, nailed over midwicket"
1.2,"Unadkat to Padikkal, no run","good length at off stump, defended from deep in the crease"
1.1,"Unadkat to Padikkal, SIX runs","young and free-flowing This is an overpitched ball slanted into his pad and he just picks it up, and times it to send a long back over square leg"
0.6,"Archer to Finch, FOUR runs","slower shor ball gives Finch some extra time, and he arches into the leg side to slap this over the covers"
0.5,"Archer to Finch, no run","beaten on the pull. Short and climbing outside off, pulls from inside the line of that"
0.4,"Archer to Finch, no run","good shout for lbw I thought. Maybe going over. He pins him deep in the crease, trying to flick a middle stump ball and cops it on the front pad in front of the stumps. The high part of the pad"
0.3,"Archer to Finch, no run","short and just outside off, defended on the back foot"
0.2,"Archer to Finch, no run","short ball climbing up at middle stump, gets the front leg in the air trying to pull but is cramped and caught on the body"
0.1,"Archer to Padikkal, 1 run","short and just outside off, dropped into the off side with soft hands"
19.6,"Saini to Archer, no run","cops that on the helmet. Good length all at 140,7kph outside off. Sinks into it and tries to ramp, only to miss completely. He's on his feet and disappointed at himself for not getting some runs off of that ball"
19.5,"Saini to Tewatia, 1 run","slower short ball at leg stump, mistimed pull to deep square's left"
19.4,"Saini to Tewatia, no run","beaten. It was there for the slog, length-wise. But was quickly past him outside off as he looked for the wrist flick again"
19.3,"Saini to Tewatia, SIX runs","swats it to the deep square boundary with some help from the fielder who was putting in a valiant effort to his right. Walks into another high full toss outside off, and just has a flick at it. Gurkeerat jumps to his right, one-handed and can't hang on. That was very close to being above the waist, I thought"
19.2,"Saini to Tewatia, SIX runs","sends it flying over square leg A good length ball in the corridor, shuffles into the corridor and is right behind it. Uses the pace to loft it high and about 83 metres behind"
19.2,"Saini to Tewatia, (no ball)","oh that's hit him straight on the throat it looks like. I hope not. Looks like just under the throat, collarbone region. A beamer as he walks into the off side for the ramp. He's on his feet now. Whew, that looked scary. A ball in the mid-140s."
19.1,"Saini to Archer, 1 run","low full toss at off stump, mistimed drive off the outer half to mid-off's right"
18.6,"Udana to Archer, 1 run","full outside off, carted down to long-off's right"
18.5,"Udana to Archer, no run","wow what is happening here. Slower yorker gets Archer on the toe. He's resting on his at and looking into the floor as his partner wants the run. He's run all the way next to Archer before turning. The bowler has responded late, turns around and tries to long it in the direction of Kohli who's running in from extra cover. But he can't hang on and the opportunity for the run out is gone"
18.4,"Udana to Archer, 2 runs","full and wide outside off, chopped to sweeper's left"
18.3,"Udana to Archer, SIX runs","nails this one. Slower ball, short of a good length. Short enough  for him to line it up and club it flat over the fielder"
18.2,"Udana to Archer, no run","past his swing. Full toss pushed wide outside off, backs into the off side for the slog and can't connect on it"
18.1,"Udana to Tewatia, 1 run","back-of-the-hand length ball just outside off, can only slice it to long-off as it rises off the pitch and gets sweep"
17.6,"Saini to Archer, FOUR runs","squeezed past short fine. Full toss on the pad, free swing, thick inside edge to short fine's right"
17.5,"Saini to Tewatia, 1 run","short of deep square. Bouncer at the front shoulder, swipes hurriedly from under that"
17.4,"Saini to Tewatia, no run","oh smart stop frm AB. Full toss ball outside off, looks to slap through the covers, gets a thick edge that AB plucks on the bounce with a dive to his left"
17.3,"Saini to Archer, 1 run","short at middle stump, looks to pull but is completely late on it. Lobbed over the bowler's head off the sticker part of the bat"
17.2,"Saini to Tewatia, 1 run","short at middle stump, pulled to deep square's left"
17.1,"Saini to Tewatia, SIX runs","nonchalant short-arm whip over square leg! Full on off stump, about 143kph. He shuffles and gets deep in the crease and stays very still. Then swishes his arms, flat and over the fielder"

16.5,"Chahal to Archer, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
16.4,"Chahal to Lomror, OUT","taken at long-off. Smart, smart bowling from Chahal. Knows Lomror's strength is that arc for the leg-side hit, so slides this close to the tramline and full outside off. He looks for the sweep but the angle, the width, the pace - everything is against him. Sliced up"
16.3,"Chahal to Tewatia, 1 run","full on leg stump, leans in and flicks to deep square"
16.2,"Chahal to Lomror, 1 run","full toss on leg stump, flicked straight to deep midwicket"
16.1,"Chahal to Lomror, SIX runs","oh such a good hitter. The third instance of Lomror absolutely nailing one off the middle. Another full ball at middle stump, and he creates the swinging room for a slog sweep"
15.6,"Udana to Lomror, 1 run","yorker outside off, jams it into the covers with soft hands"
15.5,"Udana to Parag, OUT",taken at long-on. Udana's taken the pace off that again and that means Parag can't get the power on this pull shot. Not on this pitch. Short and sitting up for the pull but taken well inside
15.4,"Udana to Lomror, 1 run","full and just outside off, gets the front leg out and drills it to mid-off"
15.3,"Udana to Parag, 1 run","offcutter, short of a length and just outside off. Tapped to long-on with soft hands but quick work from the man down there prevents that"

15.2,"Udana to Parag, 2 runs","full slower ball on leg stump, clips with soft hands into the vacant midwicket region"
15.1,"Udana to Lomror, 1 run","good length outside off, opens the face to drive to sweeper's left"
14.6,"Chahal to Lomror, 1 run",pumps this firmly! Whew. What bat-speed. But Devdutt cleans up to his left. He got to the pitch of this length ball outside off and drills it past his partner
14.5,"Chahal to Lomror, SIX runs","ooooooooh that is far! Some hit. Full on off stump, steps out and makes the pitch of this and nails the slog. Far far away in the direction of wide long-on"
14.4,"Chahal to Lomror, no run","beaten on the slog sweep. Good length and pushed across him, a googly. Too wide and past his swinging arc"
14.3,"Chahal to Parag, 1 run","tossed up full and wide outside off, mistimed loft to long-off's right"

4.4,"Chahal to Lomror, 1 run","full on off stump, front leg into the leg side and driven to mid-off"
4.3,"Chahal to Lomror, no run","good length on middle stump, watchfully defended on the front foot"
4.2,"Chahal to Lomror, no run","full on middle stump, well forward and defends down the pitch"
4.1,"Chahal to Samson, OUT","has he got him? The sounds from around the infield indicate he has! Umpire sends it upstairs. Chahal diving low to the right in his follow through after beating Samson in flight. Soft signal is out. This is not too straightforward it is essentially the thumb, index and middle finger of Chahal's right hand that catch the ball. As he goes down, there is a chance the ball could be sticking out the webbing as he goes down. But there is no conclusive evdience says the third umpire. So that will remain out. It was a full ball on off stump, he wanted to drive through the covers and it pinged off the inside half. Massive, massive wicket and once again Rajasthan's middle order have a job to do"
3.6,"Saini to Uthappa, no run","past the edge. A wicket maiden. Good length and outside off, with some climb. Looks to feel for that on the front foot and is done for pace"
3.5,"Saini to Uthappa, no run",short of a good length and slanted into the corridor. Shuffles and is cramped. Defended towards midwicket
3.4,"Saini to Uthappa, no run","good length and nipping back in from outside off, 143kph. Shuffles and gets in line. Defended off the inside half"
3.3,"Saini to Uthappa, no run","good length outside off, tentative forward push. Off the inside half and rolls towards the keeper"
3.2,"Saini to Uthappa, no run","good length outside off, shuffles and defends to midwicket off the front foot"
3.1,"Saini to Buttler, OUT","taken at first slip! But is that a bump ball? Soft signal is out. It was a yorker length ball outside off that Buttler was looking to drive, so there's a lot of jamming action happening which can complicate such calls. But that is off the outside edge and aerial before Buttler's inside edge hits the turf, so it is clean. Saini delivers immediately. Low catch to the right at first slip"
2.6,"Udana to Samson, no run","beaten. Full and pushed across him, driving with the angle but the bat is inside the line this time"
2.5,"Udana to Samson, FOUR runs","just picks off where he left. Whew. You get pure aesthetic value at the very least from this guy. This is today's exhibit. Full ball just outside off, half a stride out, all of the bat face offered and gently caressed wide of mid-off"
2.4,"Udana to Smith, OUT","chopped on! Short and wide outside off. Smith throws his hands at that with the weight seemingly on his front leg. Might have required a later cut, because this grips a touch and he's through the shot very early"
2.3,"Udana to Buttler, 1 run","back-of-the-hand slower ball, good length at middle stump. Flicks to deep square"
2.2,"Udana to Buttler, FOUR runs","pulled to the midwicket boundary this time. Good length at middle stump, sitting up once more and pulled into the turf off the front foot"
2.1,"Udana to Buttler, SIX runs","wow, made that looks ridiculously simple. A slower ball, good length and sitting up at middle stump. 100kph. He was already on the front foot, so it takes even more effort to make up the strength for this whip over midwicket. He does it without fuss, just swipes across the line"
1.6,"Sundar to Buttler, 1 run",good length and across middle stump. Brings out the reverse sweep but can't get too much bat on that. Trickles to backward point off the high part
1.5,"Sundar to Buttler, no run","good length at leg stump, flicked to square leg off the front foot"
1.4,"Sundar to Smith, 1 run",good length and turning into middle stump. Punched to long-on off the back foot
1.3,"Sundar to Buttler, 1 run","short of a good length, at middle and leg. Punched to long-on off the back foot"
1.2,"Sundar to Buttler, FOUR runs","oh nicely done. Good length on leg stump, takes a step into the leg side but then comes back in line with the stumps and casually taps this on the head, swept past short fine"
1.1,"Sundar to Buttler, no run","good length at middle, flicked to square leg"
0.6,"Udana to Smith, FOUR runs",clipped past short fine. Good length and at his regular speed. Smith shuffles to open up the leg side - as he does - and this one is to that fielder's left
0.5,"Udana to Smith, no run","leading edge down the pitch. Second slower ball from Udana this over. That one was 99kph. Good length and at leg stump, he was looking to flick that"
0.4,"Udana to Smith, no run","beats the inside edge. 128kph, short of a good length and coming back into the corridor. Smith was pushing on the back foot for the one angled across him"
0.3,"Udana to Buttler, 1 run","slower ball, good length and just outside off. Jumps into the line again but has to adjust. Dropped into the off side with hands"
0.2,"Udana to Buttler, FOUR runs",tickled past short fine. He's walking about already. Good length and angled across him from an off stump line. Jumps into the line and puts it away
0.1,"Udana to Buttler, no run","outside edge doesn't carry to wide slip. Good length ball to start off, at an off stump line. Defends with soft hands, a tad inside the line"
19.6,"Abdul Samad to Sam Curran, SIX runs","good length outside off, steps out and crunches it over the bowler's head"
19.5,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, 1 run","along the floor to long-on. Full on middle stump, attempted slog down to the fielder there with no danger"
19.4,"Abdul Samad to Sam Curran, 1 run","full and flat outside off, steps out and swings for it. It's off the thick inside edge to deep midwicket's right"
19.3,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, 1 run","front of the hand. Good length and outside off. He slices it, an attempted pull, and it's only a single at long-on"
19.2,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, FOUR runs","drills it straight through the bowler. Tossed up at off stump, helicoptered back at the bowler, who can barely react as this whistles between him and the stumps"
19.1,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, 2 runs","tossed up at off stump, steps out but he can barely have a swing at this. It trickles to long-on's left and he comes back for the second"
19.1,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, 5 wide","oh this is a disastrous start for SRH! It's not terrible bowling, to be honest. Slips a length ball down leg side as Dhoni steps out at him. Bairstow loses his footing as he looks to go for that down leg side and he misses it. And it dribbles past all the fielders"
18.6,"Ahmed to Dhoni, 1 run","good length, slower ball on off stump. Mistimed slog dragged to long-on"
18.5,"Ahmed to Dhoni, SIX runs",slapped over the midwicket boundary! Slower short ball sitting nicely up for him and he has slaughtered that off the front foot! It's down to 29 off 7. Warner is disgusted with that last ball
18.4,"Ahmed to Dhoni, 2 runs",slower short ball cutting across middle. Miscued pull lobbed into vacant midwicket
18.3,"Ahmed to Dhoni, 2 runs","mistimed slog in front of long-on. Another cutter, at a good length and he can't get the slog away. Sliced over the bowler"
18.2,"Ahmed to Dhoni, FOUR runs","oh that is a terrible misfield at deep midwicket. Samad, who might now have to carry that into the last over as a bowler! Slower length ball had been dragged to Samad's left. It was not menacing by any means, he just let it through after making the ground"
18.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Sam Curran, 1 run","yorker to start. And a good one at leg stump. No swinging room for Curran, who can only get it off the toe-end to deep midwicket"
17.6,"Natarajan to Sam Curran, 1 run","low full toss on leg stump, flicked straight to deep backward square"
17.5,"Natarajan to Sam Curran, SIX runs",hooks his first ball into the first tier! WOW. Some talent to be able to hit that first up. Short ball in the corridor. He shuffles and walks straight into the line.That is quite a heave. 86 metres!
17.4,"Natarajan to Jadeja, OUT","picks Samad out at deep backward square! Oh he watched that so closely into his hands. Short ball at middle stump, on the front foot to pull. Samad doesn't have to move a lot. Makes a strong base, brings out the reverse cup and holds on. Camera cuts to Muralitharan in the dugout mouthing ""good catch"" as he looks sheepishly at the people around him"
17.3,"Natarajan to Jadeja, SIX runs",swiped over the square leg boundary! For his fifty. Attempted yorker is a friendly full toss on the pads and he helps it over the boundary with the angle. His first ever T20 fifty
17.2,"Natarajan to Jadeja, 2 runs","nails the yorker but they have two. In at leg stump, he managed to squeeze it between long-on and deep midwicket"
17.1,"Natarajan to Jadeja, FOUR runs","dropped and helped along to the long-off boundary. Manish Pandey the man running back from mid-off. It was a yorker at middle, he was looking to slog that. Ended up slicing it. Pandey went back and to his right and lunged. Only managed to push it backwards in the end, wasn't easy"
16.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Jadeja, 1 run","just about stopped at short third. Good length and just outside off, late cut between backward point and short third. Khaleel dives to his left and manages to stop with his body but he's grimacing and he's stayed on the floor, holding what looks like his right knee. Did he slip and end up seating that knee on the ball?"
16.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Jadeja, no run","beats him. Slower ball, good and just outside off. Gets the front leg into the leg side and tries to chop towards third man"
16.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Jadeja, 2 runs","legcutter at a good length, cramping him as he backs into the leg side. He dabs it through square leg with soft hands and steals a second"
16.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Jadeja, FOUR runs","three in three! This is overpitched and down leg side. Stays tall and allows it on, tickles it fine"
16.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Jadeja, FOUR runs",past short fine. Short and at the hips from Bhuvi and that is pressure straight away on him. Boundaries off the first two balls. Easily swiped away
16.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Jadeja, FOUR runs",inside edge past Bairstow. Short and cramped him at the mid-riff. Looks for the pull and gets lucky
15.6,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, no run","full and just outside off, leans in and watchfully taps it back to the bowler"
15.5,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, no run","good length at off stump, defended off the back foot"
15.4,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, FOUR runs","can't stop this. Short and at leg stump, pulled firmly to Natarajan's left again, and this time he's not close to it"
15.3,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, 2 runs","dropped short at middle stump, pulled firmly to deep backward square's left. Natarajan is scambling and sprinting and huffing to his left. And he has some fortune as this slams into his leg as he runs for it"
15.2,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, 1 leg bye","pinned him deep in the crease and the lbw appeal is turned down. Warner reluctantly reviews. Good length, middle and leg it appeared to pitch. Turning into Jadeja who is struck in front of leg stump trying to flick. Ball tracking has the pitching outside leg. The review is lost."
15.1,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, 1 run","thick inside edge along the ground to deep square. Rashid tempts him, googly, full and slow outside off. Can't get the shot away"
14.6,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, 1 run","just short of short third man! Overspin because of the flight, Dhoni looking to cut as it gets steep on him. Thick edge loops in front of Natarajan who dives to his right and manages to parry it forwards"
14.5,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, no run","good length outside off, sliding on again and once again he's looked to hit it too hard. Mistimed punch to extra cover"
14.4,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, no run","inside edge onto his boot. Good length ball slides on straight outside off, looks to wallop this over midwicket, cops it on his back boot"
14.3,"Abdul Samad to Jadeja, 1 run","short and wide outside off, backs away and cuts to sweeper"
14.2,"Abdul Samad to Jadeja, SIX runs","dragged over long-on. Full and outside off. Steps out and gets a little cramped, but manages to get the swing away. It's flat and to long-on's right"
14.1,"Abdul Samad to Jadeja, no run","beaten. Googly, slow and short and wide. Lifts over his cut"
13.6,"Natarajan to Jadeja, 1 run",full and slanted in at middle and leg. Front foot into the leg side as he hammers this along the ground to long-on
13.5,"Natarajan to Dhoni, 1 run","yes he is, but gets an inside edge on the slog. Full slower ball, and perhaps that's what's done him. Through the attempted slog early, only a single off the boot in the off side"
13.4,"Natarajan to Jadeja, 1 run","low full toss at middle, mistimed drive to long-on"
13.4,"Natarajan to Jadeja, 1 wide","good length, slower ball down leg side. Left alone"
13.3,"Natarajan to Jadeja, 2 runs","good length outside off, allows it to come on and slices it square off the front foot. To sweeper's right"
13.2,"Natarajan to Jadeja, FOUR runs",clipped to the backward square boundary. Attempted yorker is a bit too full. A full toss at the leg in fact. Turns it away with the angle
13.1,"Natarajan to Jadeja, no run","nearly chops on. Short and just outside off, looks for the cut and it skids onto the under-edge"
12.6,"Ahmed to Dhoni, no run","offcutter, back of a length and just outside off. Punched to extra cover"
12.5,"Ahmed to Dhoni, no run",beaten on the hook. Short ball rising up at middle stump. Gets inside the line to pull it off but that's past him
12.4,"Ahmed to Jadeja, 1 run","short and just outside off, pulled firmly, lovely sound, but along the floor to deep square"
12.3,"Ahmed to Jadeja, no run","short and just outside off, steps out and makes too much room. Beaten on the cut"
12.2,"Ahmed to Dhoni, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut to third man's right"
12.1,"Ahmed to Jadeja, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut to third man"
11.6,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, 1 run","good length and in at off stump, punched to extra cover's right"
11.5,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, 1 run","googly, short of a length and in at off stump. Punched to sweeper cover"
11.4,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, 1 run","full and quick at leg stump, flicked to deep backward square"
11.3,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, no run","bowled from well behind the crease. Slows is right down. Good length and in at off stump, punched to extra cover"
11.2,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, no run","googly, back of a length outside off, cut to point"
11.1,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, no run",appeal for catch down leg side. Turned down. Good length ball pitching just outside leg and Jadeja can't get the flick away. Brushed the front pad
10.6,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, 2 runs","lovely work at sweeper by Garg. Good lengths slider outside off, half a squat and slapped past extra cover. It's sprinting away from Garg who has sprinted a long way himself before putting a big slide in"
10.5,"Abdul Samad to Jadeja, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut firmly to sweeper cover"
10.4,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, 1 run","good length outside off, miscued slog this time. Down to long-on"
10.3,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, 2 runs","short of length and wide outside off, miscued back foot punch to long-off's right"
10.2,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, FOUR runs","smoked past his left hand! Samad almost taking evasive action. Tossed up full outside off, stride down and bludgeoned at hip height. Just as well he didn't get a hand on that. Long-off can't get near it"
10.1,"Abdul Samad to Jadeja, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
9.6,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, no run","good length at off, big lunge forward to defend to extra cover"
9.5,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, no run",good length and turning away from leg stump. Dhoni wants to flick but that's back down the pitch off the leading edge
9.4,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, 1 run","googly, back of a good length and going away outside off. Punched to long-off"
9.3,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, no run","good length at off stump, quickly forward to defend down the pitch"
9.2,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, no run","slider, good length and at the stumps. Backs away and hurriedly pushes into the covers"
9.1,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, no run",good length and a googly across off stump. Backs away and pushes into the covers
8.6,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, no run","short and wide outside off, backs away for the cut but that skids on and catches the under-edge"
8.5,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, no run","dropped short outside off, cut firmly to extra cover's left but Warner's all over that"
8.4,"Abdul Samad to Jadeja, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut to sweeper"
8.3,"Abdul Samad to Jadeja, no run","good length at off stump, defended off the back foot"
8.2,"Abdul Samad to Jadhav, OUT","he's got a wicket at extra cover! Sharp catch from Warner. Good length ball, lobbed up slowly and wide outside off. Not a lot of turn, but there's dip and overspin and Jadhav is not on top of this attempted drive. It's to Warner's left at face height and he shows good reactions"
8.1,"Abdul Samad to Dhoni, 1 run","short of a good length at off stump, onto the back foot and pulls to deep midwicket"
7.6,"Rashid Khan to Jadhav, no run","good length at middle stump, deep in the crease and watchfully defended"
7.5,"Rashid Khan to Jadhav, no run","good length at middle, pushed to midwicket off the back foot"
7.4,"Rashid Khan to Jadhav, no run","inside edge as it's a googly on a good length outside off this time. This time, there is gap between bat and pad"
7.3,"Rashid Khan to Jadhav, no run",rapidly past the outside edge! Genius bowling. This is the exact line and length - and even the release - from which he bowled that googly to Dhoni earlier. Jadha covers for that and loses the outside edge battle
7.2,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, 1 run","good length, googly and in at middle. Onto the back foot to punch to long-on"
7.1,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, no run","inside edge onto pad. Googly, at a length outside off. Big gap as he has a stab at this away from the body"
6.6,"Abhishek to Dhoni, 1 run","good length at middle stump, onto the back foot and turns it into midwicket"
6.5,"Abhishek to Jadhav, 1 run","full at leg stump, flicked through square leg off the front foot"
6.4,"Abhishek to Jadhav, no run","good length outside off, defended on the front foot with the turn"
6.3,"Abhishek to Dhoni, 1 run","good length at middle stump, onto the back foot and punched to long-on"
6.2,"Abhishek to Dhoni, no run","good length, slow and at middle. 78kph. Steps out and flicks to midwicket"
6.1,"Abhishek to Jadhav, 1 run","good length at middle stump, pulled to deep midwicket"
5.6,"Natarajan to Jadhav, OUT","the bails are off at the striker's end, Faf appears to be short.Oh boy this is going to be controversial, I can already tell. Bairstow is sprinting towards the stumps as midwicket's throw comes in on the bounce. He uses his momentum to push it on the half volley towards the stumps. The ball hits the stumps, BUT, so does Bairstow. Seemingly at the same time. But that is the side angle. From front on, the umpire is convinced it's the ball that hits the stumps when Faf is short. So that is out. It was a full ball flicked to midwicket's right, his throw was halfway between looking for the direct hit and lobbing it to the keeper - just ended up a feeble lob. But it has worked and it is the man who had just gotten going. He was struggling to make that run, possibly a result of the knock he took last over"
5.5,"Natarajan to du Plessis, 1 leg bye","good length at leg stump, looks to flick, cops in on the pad"
5.4,"Natarajan to du Plessis, FOUR runs","adjusts, improvises, and finds the same spot again. Short ball this time, and slower, and wider. Faf is down the pitch again and this time he has to reach out more and then uses the horizontal bat to drag it over the umpire again"
5.3,"Natarajan to du Plessis, FOUR runs","oh lovely! Good length at middle stump, pushed across him again. But Faf negates the angle entirely by running down at him and then lifting this cleanly on the up, straight and over the umpire"
5.2,"Natarajan to Jadhav, 1 run","good length on middle stump, flicked to square leg's right"
5.1,"Natarajan to Rayudu, OUT","knocks the top of off! Rayudu playing down the wrong line. Need to watch this closely, because he's very far away from this. Surprisingly far away. Slow-mos show it was just a good length ball, nice upright seam, aimed to go across him. No  movement on that, but for some reason Rayudu is down leg, bringing the bat down angled towards midwicket and playing outside leg stump"
4.6,"Ahmed to du Plessis, no run","misses the full toss at his leg and might have copped that on his right knee. Just above it, yes. That'll sting. Lost his shape trying to slog that inswinger"
4.6,"Ahmed to du Plessis, 1 wide","swings past leg stump as Faf sets up for another ramp This is an attempted yorker, but it's just a little too far down leg"
4.5,"Ahmed to du Plessis, FOUR runs","neatly ramped fine. Again, the length is predictable. Also helps this is a slower ball, short of a good length outside off. He's set up, he waits, and he executes well"
4.4,"Ahmed to du Plessis, no run","just short of third man this time and oncethe body again, good work from the fielder to get the body behind it. Slower ball at a length outside off, thick outside edge on the slash"
4.3,"Ahmed to Rayudu, 1 run","just short of Rashid who has done exceptionally not to let this bounce past him. Short ball, half-hearted pull pings off the top edge. Rashid sprints to his right, then slides on his hips and uses both his hands to swat this in front of himself on the half-volley"
4.2,"Ahmed to du Plessis, 3 runs",waits in the crease this time and pulls over midwicket off the high part of the bat. Garg gives chase and dives to pull it back in. Deep square ran a long way to his left to accompany him and was there to throw it back in
4.1,"Ahmed to du Plessis, FOUR runs","punched past mid-off. Khaleel is , more often than not, going to bowl a short, hard length. Faf steps out in anticipation of that and uses the angled bat to hammer this on the up to the fielder's left"
3.6,"Natarajan to Rayudu, FOUR runs","low full toss at leg stump, leans in and clips it well in front of the deep square fielder"
3.5,"Natarajan to du Plessis, 1 leg bye",big appeal for lbw and the bowler's possibly more interested than usual because Faf had set up on an off stump line attempting this flick. But this has pitched outside leg
3.4,"Natarajan to Rayudu, 1 run","short of third man. Short and steep delivery at middle stump. He steps out and has a hoick from under it. Was looking to go over mid-on, ended up slicing it"
3.3,"Natarajan to Rayudu, no run","full at middle stump, 136kph, shuffles and drives to mid-on"
3.2,"Natarajan to Rayudu, no run","short at middle and leg, steps out and looks to swipe to fine leg but cops that on the thigh guard"
3.1,"Natarajan to Rayudu, no run",good length and tight at the body. Defended into the off side
2.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu, 1 run","short and moving away from him outside off, cuts off the thick outside edge to third man"
2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to cover"
2.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu, 1 run","good length and nipping away outside off, shuffles and uses the pace to guide that to third man"
2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, OUT",chops it on! Not a moment this innings when Watson was in control. This is the widest of the deliveries Bhuvneshwar's bowled to him. But it is still an incoming ball. He's in a half squat trying to cut it. Inside edge and that's all tonight from Watson
2.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run",inside edge onto back leg. Another inswinger aimed for the top of off stump. Wants to slash behind point on the front foot
2.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","short of a good length, aimed for the top of off. Tapped into the covers"
1.6,"Ahmed to du Plessis, no run",short and into the mid-riff as he looks to pull this incoming ball
1.6,"Ahmed to du Plessis, 1 wide","short and down leg side, beaten on the pull"
1.5,"Ahmed to Watson, 1 run",good length and swung in at off stump. Hurriedly dropped into the off side with soft hands
1.4,"Ahmed to du Plessis, 1 run",short and just outside off. Walks into the line and shovels it out to deep square
1.3,"Ahmed to du Plessis, no run","good length at middle stump, clipped to midwicket with the swing"
1.2,"Ahmed to du Plessis, no run","full and tailing in at middle stump. Drives from in front of his pad, off the inside half to mid-on"
1.1,"Ahmed to du Plessis, no run","good length and swung in at leg stump, 136.9kph, flicked to square leg"
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run",narrowly saved from being bowled by the inside edge. Looks to drive on the up with a massive bat-pad gap against this inswinger
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, no run","big lbw appeal as Watson is trapped on the front foot looking to defend. Might have been going down leg, this inswinger. They don't think of the review. He was struck in front of middle and leg"
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, 1 run",short of a good length and swung into his hips. On his toes to clip this to fine leg
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, no run",big inswinger but Faf is up to it. Good length and headed for the top of off. Not too much feet from Faf but defends solidly
0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, no run",good length and curving away outside off. Punched to extra cover off the back foot
0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, no run","good length ad wide outside off, left alone"
19.6,"Thakur to Garg, no run","through to Dhoni, possibly rolling off the outside edge. Another knuckle ball it appears. Full and wide and couldn't connect on the drive"
19.5,"Thakur to Abdul Samad, 1 run","lovely yorker again. Just not giving him anything. Wide outside off, chopped to deep point"
19.4,"Thakur to Abdul Samad, 2 runs","poor fielding. Yorker outside off, another big swing at it, it trickles into the covers. Bravo at extra cover, who is closest to it, has not moved for it at all. Rayudu has to come across all the way from backward point and they pinch a second"
19.3,"Thakur to Abdul Samad, 2 runs","miscued loft to long-off's left. Slower full toss wide outside off, a knuckle ball. Shuffled, got on a knee and swung hard for it. But that seems to be making him lose balance"
19.2,"Thakur to Abdul Samad, no run","yorker outside off, difficult to get that way. A big swing of the bat, lovely bat speed and all, but it can only go as far as extra cover"
19.1,"Thakur to Garg, 1 run","sliced into the backward point region. Slower ball wide outside off, got too far under that"
19.1,"Thakur to Garg, (no ball)","can't clear extra cover. Good length ball, wide outside off. Slapped on the up and Bravo holds on with a reverse cup. But the third umpire has spotted Thakur overstepping. Garg's night is not done yet"
18.6,"Bravo to Garg, 1 run","low full toss on off stump, walks across his stumps and flicks to deep midwicket's right to bring up his fifty. Points the bat sharply at the dugout and then frustratedly whacks his front pad. It's a day of confusing emotional reactions from SRH batsmen! It's managed to get chuckles out of Laxman and Warner"
18.5,"Bravo to Abdul Samad, 1 run","full and wide outside off, too far away from him. Looks like an attempted helicoper shot. Ends up a drive at extra cover"
18.4,"Bravo to Abdul Samad, 2 runs","yorker outside off, has a big slog at that. It's off the inside half of the bat to deep midwicket's right. The poor timing allows a second on the big side"
18.3,"Bravo to Garg, 1 run","full and just outside off, driven along the floor to extra cover"
18.2,"Bravo to Garg, 2 runs","full outside off, sliced to deep backward point's left and takes on his arm to complete two"
18.1,"Bravo to Garg, FOUR runs","whipped over backward square. The line is going to be off stump given there are two square fielders in the circle on the leg side. Garg anticipates that, gets on one knee and slaps from underneath"
17.6,"Chahar to Abhishek, OUT","caught behind. Well, it's one out of three for CSK in the over. It ends Sharma's innings - the one that injected pace into the middle overs for them. It's a slower short ball, he looks for the pull, gets an edge behind and Chahar is beaming ironically as he finally gets one"
17.5,"Chahar to Garg, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, chopped to backward point's left"
17.4,"Chahar to Garg, FOUR runs","gets it fine. Slower short ball has beaten him for lack of pace, but he's used his wrists to adjust and make sure his attempted pull isn't in front of square. Might not have been precisely looking to get it over short fine, but for his efforts, he is rewarded with the ball floating over Watson there"
17.3,"Chahar to Garg, 2 runs",full and at the stumps and he clips this to to deep square's right
17.3,"Chahar to Garg, 1 wide","slower short ball down leg side, beaten on the pull"
17.2,"Chahar to Abhishek, 1 run","dropped at sweeper cover this time! Good length outside off, opens the face, wants to go over extra cover. Ends up slicing it high. Thakur is already under it as he starts. Gets it in his grasp too but it pops out"
17.1,"Chahar to Abhishek, FOUR runs","Jadeja drops it at deep midwicket. Sharma seems to be beaten by the length of that leg-side boundary but he survives. Slower short ball outside off, hoicks it Jadeja's left. He makes his ground, to his left, and seems to have taken his eyes off it late. Trickles into the boundary behind him"
16.6,"Sam Curran to Garg, no run",beaten but there was a chance to get more runs. Overpitched outside off again and he couldn't get bat on the chop this time
16.5,"Sam Curran to Garg, FOUR runs","expertly done. Slower cutter at a length, outside off. Allows it to slide on and opens the face to get this between backward point and short third"
16.4,"Sam Curran to Garg, SIX runs","whipped over the deep midwicket boundary! Overpitched ball at middle stump, and once again he's just deep in the crease and waiting for the full one. Gets low and flicks quickly at this and gets it to the fielder's right"
16.4,"Sam Curran to Garg, (no ball) FOUR runs",full toss above the waist and sliced past point.  Wide outside off and he adjusts nicely to carve this
16.3,"Sam Curran to Garg, FOUR runs","well placed. This is low-risk, high reward. Full ball at off stump, he stays low and watches it on, right under his eyes. And then opens the face late to beat backward point to the right"
16.2,"Sam Curran to Garg, 2 runs","another overthrow at long-on. Offcuttter outside off, sliced to backward point. Thakur has a throw for the non-striker's stumps. Long-on on would have backed that up, to be fair. Curran got a hand on it though, a half-stop, and that's what gives them the extra run"
16.1,"Sam Curran to Abhishek, 1 run","good length, offcutter just outside off. Gets forward and flicks to deep midwicket's left"
15.6,"Thakur to Garg, FOUR runs","gorgeous. That is a good looking pull. Short ball outside off, a nice swivel of the upper body as he uses the pace and drags this to the backward square boundary with a short swing. Brilliant connection"
15.5,"Thakur to Abhishek, 1 run","full outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
15.4,"Thakur to Garg, 3 runs","short outside off, opens the face to slice to third man.  Draws the throw to the non-striker's end where it might have been close if Thakur was behind the stumps. He has to try and relay it instead as Sharma dives. The result is an extra run at long-on"
15.3,"Thakur to Garg, no run","full on middle stump, flicked straight to midwicket"
15.2,"Thakur to Abhishek, 1 run","good length outside off, shuffles and drives to long-on"
15.2,"Thakur to Abhishek, 1 wide","good length and very wide outside off, left alone"
15.1,"Thakur to Garg, 1 run","good length outside off, driven on the rise to sweeper cover"
14.6,"Bravo to Abhishek, FOUR runs",oh clean. Overpitched outside off and he's got good batspeed under this lofted drive. Flat and to mid-off's left with disdain
14.5,"Bravo to Garg, 1 run","full slower ball outside off, leans in and flicks to long-on"
14.4,"Bravo to Abhishek, 1 run","full ball at leg stump, steps out and slices to sweeper's right"
14.4,"Bravo to Abhishek, 1 wide","slower bouncer, down leg side. Beaten on the attempted hook"
14.3,"Bravo to Garg, 1 run","full slower ball at leg stump, flicked to long leg"
14.2,"Bravo to Abhishek, 1 run","slower ball, full toss on leg stump at 105kph. Waits on it and flicks to midwicket"
14.1,"Bravo to Abhishek, no run","good length offbreak at off stump, defended to point"
13.6,"Jadeja to Garg, 2 runs","short and just outside off, chopped to sweeper's left"
13.5,"Jadeja to Abhishek, 1 run","short of a good length just outside off, punched to long-on"
13.4,"Jadeja to Abhishek, SIX runs",pumped over midwcket! Jadeja punished again for dropping it short. Sitting up outside off and this is a lovely connection on the front-foot pull
13.3,"Jadeja to Abhishek, FOUR runs","reverse-swat to the point boundary. Short of a good length outside off, sitting up nicely and he nails the connection on it"
13.2,"Jadeja to Abhishek, no run",appeal for lbw turned down as he steps out at this length ball and has a slog. Cops it high on the front leg
13.1,"Jadeja to Garg, 1 run","good length just outside off, whipped to deep midwicket"
12.6,"Chawla to Abhishek, no run","googly, good length at middle. Defended on the front foot"
12.5,"Chawla to Abhishek, no run","googly, good length on off stump. Defended off the back foot"
12.4,"Chawla to Garg, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut to sweeper"
12.3,"Chawla to Abhishek, 1 run","googly, full on off stump, driven to long-off"
12.2,"Chawla to Abhishek, no run","good length at off stump, driven to extra cover. Who has a shy at the non-striker's and would have caught Garg well outside the crease. Where was he going?! Curran with the throw"
12.1,"Chawla to Abhishek, FOUR runs","googly full and down leg side, takes it on with a sweep and gets it past short fine"
11.6,"Jadeja to Abhishek, 1 run","good length at off, punched to long-on"
11.5,"Jadeja to Abhishek, no run","good length at off, tapped down the pitch"
11.4,"Jadeja to Abhishek, no run","good length at off, shuffles and flicks to midwicket"
11.3,"Jadeja to Abhishek, no run","good length at the stumps, clipped to midwicket"
11.2,"Jadeja to Abhishek, no run","good length on the stumps, pushed off the front foot"
11.1,"Jadeja to Garg, 1 run","good length at off, pushed through cover"
10.6,"Chawla to Williamson, OUT","they've got Kane next ball! This is a gift. This is a sight - an angry Williamson. No way to tell why from here, but what we can argue pretty confidently is that there wasn't a run to Rayudu's right here at midwicket. Did Garg call for it and then change his mind? Can't think of another reason for this anger. It was a good length ball flicked to mdiwicket's right. Williamson was halfway down, and went back. The throw was wide but there was so much time that Dhoni could flick it onto the stumps and still catch Williamson a few yards short"
10.5,"Chawla to Warner, OUT","are we even surprised anymore with this guy? Faf du Plessis with yet another perfectly timed jump at the boundary to help his team out. Good length ball at middle stump, steps out and looks to drag this over long-on. Faf waits, jumps, lands and then is on the verge of losing his balance. So, once again, he lobs it up inside play and comes back for it. Calm as ever"
10.4,"Chawla to Warner, FOUR runs","good length on middle stump, brings out the conventional sweep this time. Flat and to deep midwicket's left"
10.3,"Chawla to Williamson, 1 run","full on off stump, driven to long-off with the turn"
10.2,"Chawla to Warner, 1 run","a switched late-cut. Short of a length at leg stump. Flips around and changes his grip to right-handed, but there's no room with this googly. A late cut to short fine "
10.1,"Chawla to Warner, no run","good length and sliding on at middle stump, backs away and punches to extra cover"
9.6,"Bravo to Williamson, no run",half an appeal for lbw as he nails a yorker at off stump. Kane got the front leg across as he jammed this into the off side. Might have been and then toe
9.5,"Bravo to Williamson, no run","good length and just outside off, driven on the rise to backward point"
9.4,"Bravo to Warner, 1 run","full slower ball at middle stump, whipped down to long-on"
9.3,"Bravo to Williamson, 1 run","short at middle stump, flicked to long leg"
9.2,"Bravo to Williamson, no run",good bouncer. Just under his left eye and he gets the head into the off side to let that go
9.1,"Bravo to Warner, 1 run",full toss and a dipping slower ball outside off. Driven to sweeper cover
8.6,"Chawla to Warner, 1 run","dropped short on middle stump, pulled along the ground to deep midwicket"
8.5,"Chawla to Williamson, 1 run","good length outside off, punched to sweeper with the turn"
8.4,"Chawla to Warner, 1 run","good length at leg stump, watchfully pushed into the midwicket region"
8.3,"Chawla to Warner, no run","google, short and across the corridor. Backs away and cuts to cover"
8.2,"Chawla to Warner, FOUR runs",past short third man. You just know Warner's going to reverse sweep as early as possible. First ball on this occasion. Fetches it from middle stump and it's quickly past Watson
8.1,"Chawla to Williamson, 1 run",short of a good length and gripping outside off. Turns away too but there's enough time to tuck this into vacant midwicket
7.6,"Thakur to Williamson, 1 run","thick edge down to third man. There was a gully, but this is wide of him. Good length ball moving away off the seam as he drives away from the body"
7.5,"Thakur to Williamson, no run","good length just outside off, leans in for the forward defence but then wants to open the face and run it towards third man. Gently rolls out to backward point"
7.4,"Thakur to Williamson, no run","full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
7.3,"Thakur to Williamson, FOUR runs","briefly in the air but that's past Watson's lunge to the left at extra cover. And it is a lovelry, flowing drive. Full ball outside off, got his weight into that"
7.2,"Thakur to Williamson, no run","full and just outside off, nicely forward to drive to extra cover"
7.1,"Thakur to Pandey, OUT","drives it straight to mid-off! Good length and a lot of room outside off. Sets up to drill this on the rise. Was probably looking to go wider, towards the extra cover direction. But it's come off the inside half and a simple catch for Curran"
6.6,"Bravo to Warner, no run","good length and just outside off, pushed towards mid-off on the front foot"
6.5,"Bravo to Pandey, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven to long-on"
6.5,"Bravo to Pandey, 1 wide","full and down leg side, beaten on the flick"
6.4,"Bravo to Pandey, no run","good length on leg stump, flicked to midwicket"

6.2,"Bravo to Pandey, 1 run","full at leg stump, driven down to long-on"
6.1,"Bravo to Warner, 1 run",good length and slanted in at middle stump. Backs away and pokes into the covers
5.6,"Thakur to Pandey, 2 runs","overpitched at middle stump, steps the front foot into the leg side and looks to punch this past mid-on. Doesn't get it off the middle. The fielder dives to his left and parries it behind mid-off"
5.5,"Thakur to Warner, 1 run","full on the pads, tucked to midwicket's left off the front foot"
5.4,"Thakur to Warner, FOUR runs","punched past Pandey's face at the other end. Full and just outside off, sets up nicely, full face of the bat, and no intent to keep it down"
5.3,"Thakur to Warner, no run","full at off stump, driven off the front foot to mid-off"
5.2,"Thakur to Warner, 2 runs","good length at leg stump, shoveled to deep square's right off the back foot"
5.1,"Thakur to Warner, no run","full and just outside off, mistimed drive down the pitch"
4.6,"Chahar to Pandey, no run","bouncer just past his front shoulder. He was camping on the front foot and this hook is an afterthought, the ball's well past him"
4.5,"Chahar to Warner, 1 run","full and coming in at middle, punched to mid-on"
4.4,"Chahar to Warner, no run","good length on off stump, punched to mid-off on the rise"
4.3,"Chahar to Pandey, 1 run","good length on middle stump, pushed to midwicket's right and Thakur has Warner scrambling. Can't get the direct hit at the striker's end"
4.2,"Chahar to Pandey, FOUR runs","swished over mid-on. Dropped a touch short outside off, he moves his weight onto the back leg and chips this over the fielder with a short-arm pull"
4.1,"Chahar to Pandey, no run","good length at middle stump, defended into the leg side"
3.6,"Sam Curran to Pandey, 1 run","short of a good length on off stump, pulled along the floor to deep square"
3.5,"Sam Curran to Warner, 1 run","good length and just outside off, driven on the rise to sweeper cover"
3.5,"Sam Curran to Warner, 1 wide","short and down leg side, beaten on the pull"
3.4,"Sam Curran to Warner, no run","inside edge as he falls over driving to drive this full ball from off stump. Was looking to go mid-on, caught that on the pad"
3.3,"Sam Curran to Pandey, 1 run","good length at the hips, whipped to deep square"
3.2,"Sam Curran to Pandey, FOUR runs","drills it over the bowler. Pandey with a taste for the straight drives today. Third one. This is a full slower ball just outside off and the front leg is away once again to allow swinging room. Bat turns in the hand a little but, again, all he needed to do was clear the infield"
3.1,"Sam Curran to Warner, 1 run","good length and swung away in the corridor, chopped to backward point's left"
2.6,"Chahar to Warner, 1 run","short and just outside off, pulled to midwicket off the inside half"
2.5,"Chahar to Warner, no run",good length and cramping him at middle stump line. Wants to push into the off side but he's forced to defend down the pitch
2.4,"Chahar to Warner, no run","good length and just outside off, defended into the covers"
2.3,"Chahar to Warner, no run","good length and in at middle stump, defended off the back foot"
2.2,"Chahar to Pandey, 1 run","good length just outside off, dropped into the covers. An overthrow the result of a shy at the non-striker's stumps. They weren't looking for a run"
2.1,"Chahar to Pandey, FOUR runs","oh good shape on this, both batsman and bowler. Full outswinger just outside off. He's got the head right above the line of the ball, check-driving from under his eyes. No flourish, because it's a swinging ball. Offers the full face and it's between bowler and mid-off"
1.6,"Sam Curran to Pandey, 1 run","good length on off stump, driven on the up to mid-off"
1.5,"Sam Curran to Pandey, no run","full slower ball outside off, jabs it into the off side. Was beaten by lack of pace on the drive"
1.4,"Sam Curran to Pandey, no run","good length at off stump, defended back to the bowler"
1.3,"Sam Curran to Pandey, FOUR runs","lofted over mid-off. Full inswinger in the corridor, not much of a stride, which is a decent way to create room against incoming balls. Not neatly out of the middle but he just needed to get that over Chawla"
1.2,"Sam Curran to Pandey, no run","good length and in at off stump, punched to mid-off on the up"
1.1,"Sam Curran to Warner, 1 run","good length and swung away in the corridor, opens the face and pushes into the off side"
0.6,"Chahar to Pandey, no run",chops into the turf as Chahar brings another one in off a good length. He was looking to cut but there was no room
0.6,"Chahar to Pandey, 1 wide","another big inswinger and Pandey had no idea how to deal with that, because he can barely get the bat down too. Luckily for him it's started middle and gone further down"
0.5,"Chahar to Pandey, FOUR runs",outside edge past slip and into the boundary. Full and swinging away in the corridor. Looks to drive through cover first up but survives
0.4,"Chahar to Bairstow, OUT","bowled him comprehensively! Bairstow completely outsmarted. Full inswinger starting from just outside off, upright seam brings it back in viciously and the batsman is not prepared for it. The bat swing is outside off, for the initial line, and he can't even get it close to the ball which thuds the front pad before splitting the stumps"
0.3,"Chahar to Bairstow, no run","full and swinging away in the corridor. Mistimed drive with half a stride, can't get it past extra cover"
0.2,"Chahar to Bairstow, no run",good length and shaped away from off stump. Drops it into the off side with soft hands
0.1,"Chahar to Warner, 1 run",good length and curving into the corridor. Stays leg side of that and opens the face to run this into vacant point
19.6,"Bumrah to Gowtham, 1 run",Sahmi keeps this last yorker out to end this game
19.5,"Bumrah to Gowtham, no run","yorker, just outside off, squeezes under the bat and misses the off stump"
19.4,"Bumrah to Gowtham, 2 runs","looks for the ramp over short fine this time as Bumrah pitches it up. Off the inside half of the bat it goes, past short fine"
19.3,"Bumrah to Gowtham, FOUR runs","smartly played. Bumrah bowls the short ball to cramp him up. However, this is the slower ball, giving him the time to adjust, and he ramps it over short third"
19.2,"Bumrah to Gowtham, no run","full and straight, hit to extra cover"
19.1,"Bumrah to Shami, 1 run","no fast bowlers' pact here. Short, into the ribs, hits the handle of the bat"
18.6,"Boult to Gowtham, SIX runs","oh just clears the long-off. Gets too far under this hit, sends it miles into the air, but gets enough distance on it to clear Pollard at long-off. Consolation six"
18.5,"Boult to Gowtham, FOUR runs","wide slower ball, Gowtham throws his bat at it, gets a thick edge over short third for four"
18.4,"Boult to Shami, 1 run","yorker, just outside leg, dug out for one, but the fielding from Boult is sensational. He gets to the ball quick, and flicks an underarm throw acrobatically"
18.3,"Boult to Ravi Bishnoi, OUT","another one bites the dust. Full, straight, Bishnoi makes room, gets a thick outside edge, Yadav takes a simple catch at point"
18.2,"Boult to Gowtham, 1 run","quicker, fuller, just outside off, hit to long-off for one"
18.1,"Boult to Gowtham, no run","slower length ball, just outside off, beats his slog"
17.6,"Pattinson to Ravi Bishnoi, no run","quick, full, just outside off, beats him as he looks to go inside-out"
17.5,"Pattinson to Ravi Bishnoi, no run","quick bouncer, following him, Bishnoi sways out of the line"
17.4,"Pattinson to Gowtham, 1 run","slower shortish ball, hit down to long-on for one"
17.3,"Pattinson to Ravi Bishnoi, 1 run","makes room, Pattinson stays full and straight, the mis-hit carries to a full-length diving Yadav at point but this is a really really difficult chance"
17.2,"Pattinson to Ravi Bishnoi, no run","on a length, outside off, Surya Yadav makes another diving save at point"
17.1,"Pattinson to Khan, OUT","yorker, given lbw, but he reviews it. It seems he might have hit it, but this has swung as it goes past the bat, and hits him on the toe in front of the stumps. Plumb as. Was that reverse? It went really late"
16.6,"Boult to Gowtham, 2 runs","full ball, just outside off, drilled wide of sweeper cover for two"
16.5,"Boult to Gowtham, no run","on a length, angling in, cramps him up. Hit back to Boult"
16.4,"Boult to Khan, 1 run","looks for the ramp, sees the short ball, keeps his stance and looks to pull. Is done in by the slower delivery, and is hit on the helmet"
16.3,"Boult to Gowtham, 1 run","yorker outside off, dug out for a single to extra cover"
16.2,"Boult to Khan, 1 run","yorker outside off, dug out for one"
16.1,"Boult to Khan, FOUR runs",shot of the night even though the game is dead. Sarfaraz plays the reverse pull to hit this length ball over short third after switching his stance
15.6,"Bumrah to Neesham, OUT","full toss, on off, gets big on him, for a catch at point. They will check the height of the full toss, though. Has dipped just enough in the nick of time. So it is a fair delivery, and another wicket goes down"
15.5,"Bumrah to Khan, 1 run",Bumrah has that fine leg fine as we mentioned earlier in the over. Bumrah knows the ramp is in play if he spears them in from wide on the crease. Except that it gets Sarfaraz only one run
15.4,"Bumrah to Khan, no run","wide on the crease again, punched with an open face, and Surya Yadav goes flying at point to save four runs"
15.3,"Bumrah to Neesham, 1 run",swipes a wide length ball across the line to deep midwicket for one
15.2,"Bumrah to Khan, 1 leg bye","angling in from wide on the crease, hits the pad, and accordingly for that angle, his fine leg is fine to prevent the boundary off the tickle"
15.1,"Bumrah to Khan, no run","wide on the crease, angles a length ball in, hits him high on the bat"
14.6,"Chahar to Neesham, 2 runs",worked into a hole on the leg side for a couple
14.5,"Chahar to Maxwell, OUT","angular run this time, and he keeps bowling the slow legbreaks. Maxwell plays the desperate slog, but this ball is not full enough for the shot. Deep midwicket takes the catch"
14.4,"Chahar to Maxwell, no run","straight run this time, and he bowls a really slow legbreak, beating the Maxwell switch hit for the pace"
14.3,"Chahar to Neesham, 1 run","he makes that angular run he does at death these days, and bowls a straight legbreak. Worked around the corner for one"
14.2,"Chahar to Maxwell, 1 run","looks to pull, gets a bottom edge to deep square leg"
14.1,"Chahar to Maxwell, no run","quick legbreak, outside off, defended back to him because of the turn"
13.6,"Pattinson to Maxwell, 1 run","yorker planned, yorker executed. Just the single off. Good way to close out an excellent over"
13.5,"Pattinson to Neesham, 1 run","bouncer, Neesham goes back to pull it down. Gets a single"
13.4,"Pattinson to Neesham, 2 runs","full and straight, flicked away in the air, gets two to deep midwicket"
13.3,"Pattinson to Neesham, no run","that has gone like an offcutter. This is not a slower ball. Clocked at 135ks. Short of a length, outside leg, then squares him up with the away movement and beats him"
13.2,"Pattinson to Pooran, OUT","on-pace this time. Seam-up, full, just outside off, and there has been some movement available today if you land it on the seam. This one deviates enough to take the edge. That is a huge wicket"
13.1,"Pattinson to Pooran, 2 runs","gets away with one. Seems like an offcutter from Pattinson. Pooran sees one in the slot, looking to go voer long-off. The thick outside edge lands short of sweeper cover"
12.6,"Krunal to Maxwell, no run","excellent comeback over. Bowls a low wide full toss, it straight to cover-point. Pandya has done his job"
12.5,"Krunal to Maxwell, no run",lovely wide yorker. On top of that blue tram line. Maxwell leaves it alone. Not called a wide
12.4,"Krunal to Pooran, 1 run",again bowls that length to deny him an aerial hit. Right at his heel. Dug out for a single to deep midwicket. Hardik Pandya does well to deny them the second
12.3,"Krunal to Maxwell, 1 run","on a length, no pace to work with, pushed towards long-off for one"
12.2,"Krunal to Pooran, 1 run","on off, really full, doesn't let him get under it. Dug out for one. Good bowling"
12.1,"Krunal to Pooran, 2 runs",oh he goes for the surprise full straight ball. Driven wide of long-on for two
11.6,"Bumrah to Pooran, 1 run","yorker, on the pads, dug out for one. So despite that boundary, just the seven off"
11.5,"Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 run","angling in, he shuffles across to work this to leg for one"
11.4,"Bumrah to Maxwell, no run","on a length, outside off, crunches sweetly, but straight to extra cover"
11.3,"Bumrah to Pooran, 1 run","short of a length, pitches outside leg, angles towards off, runs this down to third man"
11.2,"Bumrah to Pooran, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Doesn't matter if you are Bumrah. If you bowl short at not high pace, Pooran is going to hurt you. Pulls this over midwicket for a four"
11.1,"Bumrah to Pooran, no run","on a length, no room, pushed back towards him"
10.6,"Chahar to Pooran, 3 runs","looks for the sweep, Chahar does well to slow it down and beat him in the air, but he gets a bottom edge on the sweep, which fetches him three runs"
10.5,"Chahar to Pooran, 2 runs","short and wide again, cut away past the diving man at point"
10.4,"Chahar to Pooran, SIX runs",Pooran is on fire here. Picks the length early to rock back and pull this shortish delivery over wide long-on for six more
10.3,"Chahar to Maxwell, 1 run",shuffles across to slog this to deep midwicket
10.2,"Chahar to Maxwell, 2 runs","again the slow wide legbreak just like Chahal bowls to Maxwell. He tries to skip down the track, but gets an outside edge over slip"
10.1,"Chahar to Pooran, 1 leg bye","big appeal for lbw as he beats him on the sweep. Not given, but MI review. If it is the legbreak, has it straightened enough? No it is the wrong'un. Is it full enough to be pitching within the stumps and hitting them too? I suspect this is pitched outside leg. And it is pitched well outside leg. Good decision by the on-field umpire: he picked the googly and decided it had to be pitching outside if it was hitting the stumps"
9.6,"Pattinson to Pooran, 1 run","short of a length, some width, punched to deep point for one"
9.5,"Pattinson to Maxwell, 1 run","short of a length, straight, pushed down towards long-on"
9.4,"Pattinson to Pooran, 1 run","short of a length, wicket to wicket, played with soft hands for a single towards point"
9.3,"Pattinson to Pooran, FOUR runs",same length but gives him the width to throw his arms at. Goes flying over point
9.2,"Pattinson to Pooran, no run","seam movement?. On a length, middle and leg, lands on seam, moves away, beats him"
9.1,"Pattinson to Maxwell, 1 run","short of a length, quick, draws an inside edge for one"
8.6,"Chahar to Maxwell, 1 run","flatter, into the pads, worked to leg for one"
8.5,"Chahar to Maxwell, no run",Chahar is bowling like Chahal to Maxwell: slow wide legbreaks. He beats him again
8.4,"Chahar to Maxwell, no run","lovely slow legbreak again, and beats Maxwell again. This isn't a wide either"
8.3,"Chahar to Pooran, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, no turn, cut away for one"
8.2,"Chahar to Maxwell, 1 run","short of a length, just outside off, punched to long-off for one"
8.2,"Chahar to Maxwell, 1 wide","really slow, wide legbreak. Maxwell is beaten, but it is called wide"
8.1,"Chahar to Rahul, OUT","top of leg stump. Rahul is looking for the lap sweep, but the Chahar legbreak doesn't turn as he expects it to. That means he misses it, and the leg stump is left exposed. Chahar takes it"
7.6,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","on a length, no room, worked to leg for one"
7.5,"Krunal to Pooran, 1 run","short of a length, wide, punched to deep cover"
7.4,"Krunal to Pooran, FOUR runs","moves across early, Pandya fires one in, looking for the yorker, Pooran gets an outside edge and the pace on the ball does the job of beating short third"
7.3,"Krunal to Pooran, SIX runs","and now he gets one in the slot. On a length, just outside off, turning in, and he has slog-swept this to Dubai, it would appear. Lands on the grass banks"
7.3,"Krunal to Pooran, 1 wide","moves across this time, Pandya goes wider, and has been called for it"
7.3,"Krunal to Pooran, 1 wide",wide length ball as Pooran stands his ground this time. Called wide this time
7.2,"Krunal to Pooran, no run","flatter, quicker, fuller, straighter. Pushed back to him"
7.1,"Krunal to Pooran, no run",stays away from his reach but gets inside the tram line. Beats him on the cut
7.1,"Krunal to Pooran, 1 wide","wide length ball, too wide"
6.6,"Chahar to Pooran, 1 run","wrong'un, goes back to cut this to deep point for one"
6.5,"Chahar to Pooran, no run","nice legbreak, dipping, on a length, just outside of,f turning back in, beating him but turning too far down for the lbw"
6.4,"Chahar to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, stays low, pulled to wide long-on for one"
6.3,"Chahar to Pooran, 1 run","looks for the paddle sweep, doesn't get the full length, but goes ahead with it and takes a single"

5.5,"Krunal to Pooran, 1 run","on a length, outside off, punched to deep cover"
5.4,"Krunal to Nair, OUT","bowled'im. This plan of left-arm spin in the Powerplay has worked. He has given them nothing so far. Nair looking to manufacture a late cut, but Pandya stays on a length and draws the bottom edge into the stumps"
5.3,"Krunal to Nair, no run","quick, into the pads, worked to short fine leg"
5.2,"Krunal to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, off the bottom edge, single to point"
5.1,"Krunal to Rahul, no run",down the wicket with no intent to hit a six. Pushes this back to him
4.6,"Bumrah to Nair, no run","wide length ball, pushed to point"
4.5,"Bumrah to Agarwal, OUT","BOOM BOOM. You could just see that business had picked up this over. This is lovely bowling. After troubling him last two balls, he bowls a full ball just outside off with a Shami-like seam position. And he draws seam movement to rush through the gate"
4.4,"Bumrah to Agarwal, no run","short of a length, no room, played to point"
4.3,"Bumrah to Agarwal, no run","short of a length, holds its line, hits him high on the pad"

2.6,"Boult to Agarwal, 1 run",opens the face for a single
2.5,"Boult to Agarwal, FOUR runs","short of a length, outside off, this time he manages to place this well square of deep point. Also the fielder had moved in front of square a little"

1.1,"Pattinson to Agarwal, FOUR runs","Agarwal in scintillating form. Makes room to cut this perfctly okay delivery - short of a length, at the stumps - over cover for four"
0.6,"Boult to Rahul, FOUR runs","that's a better bouncer. Right at his badge, and quicker too, draws the mis-hit, but Krunal Pandya has misjudged the catch at long leg. Can't even get a hand to it. Charges in and the runs to his left"
0.5,"Boult to Agarwal, 1 run",runs this down to third man for one
0.4,"Boult to Agarwal, 2 runs","short of a length, on the pads, clipped away in front of long leg"
0.3,"Boult to Agarwal, no run","on a length, slight swing, defended back to him"

0.1,"Boult to Rahul, 1 run","some swing first up, but down the leg side and clipped away for one"
19.6,"Gowtham to Pollard, SIX runs","that is four sixes in the over. Kings XI have been demolished here. Gowtham is a man running up to accept his punishment. Bowls in the slot again, and Pollard gives him the punishment. Another straight six"
19.5,"Gowtham to Pollard, SIX runs","and one more. This is like stealing candy. Length-ball, in the slot, in front of the stumps, and he has just extended his arms for a six over long-on"
19.4,"Gowtham to Pollard, SIX runs","he looks to go wide of Pollard's reach, but how do you get too wide for Pollard. The long arms catch up with the ball and smash this for a straight flat six over long-off"
19.3,"Gowtham to Pandya, 1 run","oh holy molly, he has missed out on this one. Sets up strong base, gets a full toss, but the bat swings a touch too early, and he gets a leading edge to long-on"
19.2,"Gowtham to Pandya, SIX runs","now Gowtham looks to cramp Pandya up by following him, but ends up bowling in his slot. Over wide long-on for another big six"
19.1,"Gowtham to Pandya, no run",he gets away with the first one: a yorker outside off
18.6,"Shami to Pollard, FOUR runs","yorker gone wrong. Full toss on the pads, and flicked away nonchalantly for four through square leg. Nineteen off that over"
18.5,"Shami to Pollard, FOUR runs",slower bouncer. Sits up. Hooked square of deep midwicket for four more. Mumbai have turned this around
18.4,"Shami to Pollard, FOUR runs","oh that is really unfortunate. Full and fast, just outside off, slight movement away draws the outside edge, but that goes for four to third man"
18.4,"Shami to Pollard, 1 wide","slower ball outside off, out of his reach, but called wide"
18.3,"Shami to Pandya, 1 run","back to yorker, smashed to long-on for one"
18.2,"Shami to Pandya, FOUR runs","short and wide, extra bounce, some movement away, but when you throw the bat as hard as Pandya foes, the edge is likely to clear the field. over short third this goes"
18.1,"Shami to Pollard, 1 run","yorker, straight, dug out for a single"
17.6,"Neesham to Pollard, 1 run","Pollard makes room, he follows him, ends up with a high foll toss that is hit to deep midwicket for one"
17.5,"Neesham to Pandya, 1 run","goes for the yorker, ends up with a low full toss, drilled to long-on for one"
17.4,"Neesham to Pandya, FOUR runs","oh that is some hitting. Another good ball. Wide and short of a length, and off pace, but he has hit it down the ground with such power that long-off can't get around even though he has only a little distance to move"
17.3,"Neesham to Pandya, FOUR runs","Neesham has not bowled one bad ball so far but has been taken for 12 off three balls. Pandya is moving across to set up a strong base to hit. He goes wide and short of a length, but he punches him over extra cover for four"
17.2,"Neesham to Pandya, 2 runs","slower legcutter this time, hit over the infield on the off side for two"
17.1,"Neesham to Pandya, SIX runs","this is excellent hitting. Pandya is some T20 batsman. He has just come in. This is a very good legcutter, back of a length, no room. Pandya is cramped, but somehow he funds enough power with his matchstick arms to go over long-on. Into the wind, mind"
16.6,"Shami to Pollard, no run","lovely yorker. Seems plumb but Pollard has reviewed it immediately. Must have hit it then. And he is right. He has got an inside edge onto his toe. Otherwise, he has gone for all money after having shuffled right in front of his stumps"
16.5,"Shami to Pollard, 2 runs",draws another mis-hit. With a wide length ball this time. Slices off the outer half of his bat for a couple in front of deep cover
16.5,"Shami to Pollard, 1 wide",slower ball gone wrong. Wide down the leg side
16.4,"Shami to Pandya, 1 run","short of a length, wide, concedes a single to deep cover"
16.3,"Shami to Pollard, 1 run",and this time he is tight on the stumps with a short-of-a-length delivery. Concedes just the single
16.2,"Shami to Pollard, no run","short of a length, wide, 139ks, slight movement away, punched straight to point"
16.1,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, OUT","relay catch first up. Shami has bowled a dangerous ball first up. Seam-up, on-pace, in the slot, but Sharma gets more air than lemgth on it. Maxwell runs to his right from long-off, is very close to the rope when he fumbles the catch, bit still holds on, recovers well and lobs it back in before going over. Neesham, the man at long-on, has done well to come backing up for the relay catch"
15.6,"Neesham to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full, into the pads, slogged to deep midwicket for one"
15.5,"Neesham to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","oh he is picking his spots, which you can do against Neesham's pace. He knows the deep cover has just come in to give him a long-off so he makes room and lofts this full ball over cover. Another yorker gone wrong, it seems"
15.4,"Neesham to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs",he goes into the pitch but bowls seam-up and one pace. Sharma loves these 130ks short balls. Pulled over square leg for six more
15.3,"Neesham to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","another yorker gone wrong. Low full toss, and he drives it between mid-off and extra cover. He bowled so well when bowling cutters into the pitch, but yorkers are not working. Because he us missing them"
15.2,"Neesham to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","Sharma shows him the shuffle across, and Neesham attempts his first yorker of the innings. It goes wrong, and he ramps him fine of long leg for four. That is fifty for Sharma too"
15.1,"Neesham to Pollard, 1 run","slower short ball, at him, helped to long leg for one"
14.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Rohit Sharma, no run","slower, tossed up, pushed to short cover"
14.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","short part of the field, and Sharma has picked his spot well. Shouts of catch it as he pulls one that is not short enough, but he has got enough on it to clear deep midwicket"
14.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pollard, 1 run",again flat and short. Cut away to deep point
14.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pollard, no run","short of a length, wicket to wicket, punched to short midwicket"
14.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pollard, 2 runs","he goes shorter, Pollard punches this in front of deep cover, and comes back for two"
14.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pollard, SIX runs","oh the legspin slayer is here. Decent legbreak, on a length, outside off, and he has just lobbed it back over his head for a big six. That reach turns a good length ball into a half-volley"
13.6,"Gowtham to Pollard, 1 run","flat, smeared into the pads, punched past the diving short midwicket"
13.5,"Gowtham to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","down the wicket, not close to the pitch of the ball, pushed to long-on"
13.4,"Gowtham to Pollard, 1 run",stays short of the driving length again. Pushed down to long-on for one
13.3,"Gowtham to Pollard, no run","on a length, around off, pushed to short midwicket"
13.2,"Gowtham to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","on a length, flat, pushed to long-on for one"
13.1,"Gowtham to Ishan, OUT","Kishan has no choice but to slog-sweep the moment he sees a ball thrown up. However, the length is too full, which doesn't allow him the elevation. And he ends up drilling this straight to deep midwicket"
12.6,"Cottrell to Ishan, 1 run","on a length, on off, run down to point for one"
12.5,"Cottrell to Ishan, no run","short of a length, following him as he backs away, on-pace, and beats him on the bottom edge"
12.4,"Cottrell to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","nearly produces the wicket. Sees him back away, slips in a wide slower ball, draws the slice, but it falls between cover-point and the boundary rider"
12.3,"Cottrell to Rohit Sharma, no run","looks to pull a ball that is not short enough, and it skids on to hit his pad. The pressure has to be building up"
12.2,"Cottrell to Rohit Sharma, no run","length-ball offcutter, pushed to mid-off. No single. Off the toe end"
12.1,"Cottrell to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length, he throws his bat at it, gets an inside edge onto the pad"
11.6,"Neesham to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length, 130ks, punched to deep cover for another single. Another excellent over from Neesham"
11.5,"Neesham to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","slower legcutter, 110ks, kicks at him. Rohit throws his head back and runs this to third man for one"
11.5,"Neesham to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","looks for the short legcutter, but ends up slipping it down leg"
11.4,"Neesham to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length, 131ks, outside off, punched to deep point"
11.3,"Neesham to Rohit Sharma, 1 leg bye",beaten on the inside edge. Leg-bye
11.2,"Neesham to Ishan, 1 run","another catch goes down. This short ball goes big on Kishan as he looks to pull. Ends up top-edging towards midwicket. Bishnoi runs in, makes all the ground, gets under the ball, but can't hold on to it"
11.1,"Neesham to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length ball, into the pads, played along the ground to long leg"
10.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Ishan, 2 runs","down the wicket, beaten in the flight, but ends up putting it in a hole on the leg side for a couple"
10.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","looks like the googly, Sharma stays back to punch it to wide long-on"
10.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Ishan, 1 run",punched down to long-on for one
10.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Ishan, no run","goes wider with the googly, draws the toe end of the bat, and fields well off his own bowling"
10.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Ishan, SIX runs","Kishan is waiting for this wrong'un, and this is in his arc too. He slogs it over the big boundary at cow corner. Will you believe it? This is the first six of the night"
10.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","flighted legbreak, pushed straight of extra cover for one"
9.6,"Gowtham to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",pushed down to long-on to end a cheap over for Gowtham
9.5,"Gowtham to Rohit Sharma, no run","looks for the back cut, but finds the fielder at point. Ginger in getting back to the crease, and we go to the third umpire. He has made it, but there is something odd about the way he does it. His foot seems jammed so he extends the arm to get in just in time"
9.4,"Gowtham to Ishan, 1 run","flatter, shorter, punched to long-on for one"
9.3,"Gowtham to Ishan, no run","down the wicket, Gowtham pulls back the length, drawing a defensive shot"
9.2,"Gowtham to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","bunted into the leg side looking for two, but Kishan slips on the turn"
9.1,"Gowtham to Ishan, 1 run",missed run-out. Hit to the left of Gowtham and Sharma calls him through. Gowtham is caught in an awkward position where he has to run around so he gets in a feeble backhand flick allowing Kishan to get back
8.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","tries the legbreak for a change, ends up bowling it short and also giving him width. Sharma rocks back to late-cut it between point and short third"
8.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Ishan, 1 run","flatter googly, punched down to long-off now for one"
8.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Ishan, no run","another googly. Nice, slow and dipping. The point fielder is nice and tight to deny him this single"
8.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Ishan, no run","wrong'un, starts around middle and off, played with an open face, but straight to the fielder at point"
8.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short of a length again, punched down to long-on for one"
8.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length, angling away, punched to deep cover"
7.6,"Shami to Ishan, 1 run","again off the inside half, whipped to deep midwicket for one"
7.5,"Shami to Ishan, no run","another shot that is hit off the inside half of the bat. Every time Kishan has looked to hit pace down the ground, he has been hit on the inside half of the bat"
7.4,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short of a length, pulled to deep forward square leg for one"
7.3,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, no run",slight movement back in from just outside off. Enough to cramp him up. A valuable dot as he plays this straight to cover-point
7.2,"Shami to Ishan, 1 run","looks for the pick-up shot off a length on the pads, but is beaten. The ball goes hardly anywhere off the pad, but Sharma calls him through for a single"
7.1,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, he runs it down to third man for one"
6.6,"Neesham to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","wide length ball, steered to third man for one"
6.5,"Neesham to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","the first one takes the edge. An on-pace legcutter, short of a length, moves away, squares Sharma up, but the edge is too thick for Rahul to catch"
6.4,"Neesham to Ishan, 1 run","off the inside half of the bat again, and this time he gets a single to mid-on. The throw hits Kishan on the calf"
6.3,"Neesham to Ishan, no run","Kishan walks down to create a length, but Neesham sticks to his guns and bowls back of a length. Defended to cover"
6.2,"Neesham to Ishan, no run","another slower offcutter, turns away off short of a length and beats him"
6.1,"Neesham to Ishan, no run","slower ball first up, full outside off, hit to mid-on off the inside half of the bat"
5.6,"Gowtham to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","Gowatham has had a testing first over. Bowls flat, outside off, Sharma punches this beautifully, but this time Pooran gets a hand to it with a dive at extra cover. Saves two runs"
5.5,"Gowtham to Ishan, 1 run","offbreak, drifting in, no turn, worked to leg"
5.4,"Gowtham to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","slower, flighted, worked into the leg side for one"
5.3,"Gowtham to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","he knows what is coming next: a flatter shorter delivery, so he goes back early and cuts this in front of point. All touch"
5.2,"Gowtham to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Backs away early, and even though Gowtham follows him with an offbreak, he punches with an open face between mid-off and extra cover"
5.1,"Gowtham to Rohit Sharma, no run",flat offbreak outside off. Doesn't turn. Beats him on the outside edge
4.6,"Cottrell to Ishan, no run","bouncer, just outside off, he ducks it"
4.5,"Cottrell to Ishan, FOUR runs","full, just outside off, slices this over the infield. No power behind the shot as this runs off the outer half of the bat, but it manages to clear the infield"
4.4,"Cottrell to Ishan, no run","on a length, slight seam back in, or he possibly ran his fingers on it. Bowled at 135ks, so seems more like seam. Kishan has to defend"
4.3,"Cottrell to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","on a length, on off, angling away, runs off the face for a single"
4.2,"Cottrell to Ishan, 1 run","quick bouncer. Kishan, ducking for cover, manages to pull it and keep it down. Gets a single to long leg"
4.2,"Cottrell to Ishan, 1 wide",wide down the leg side
4.1,"Cottrell to Ishan, no run","length ball, angling in, defended to leg"
3.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Ishan, 1 run",not sure if this is a googly because it is so full it has no time to turn. Pushed straight of mid-off for a single
3.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Rohit Sharma, OUT","slows this down, bowls full on the pads, he sweeps it fine, calls for a single, and Surya looks like he has been run out. And he is gone. Shami is feeling his shoulder but his throw from short fine leg has done the job, catching Yadav short of his ground with a direct hit. It is Yadav's call, he has had an early start, no stutter. So he has underestimated Shami here"
3.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Rohit Sharma, no run","short slider, Sharma thinks he can hit a six, but this skids through like a flipper would, gets a bottom edge"
3.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Rohit Sharma, no run","fuller, straighter, defended back to Bishnoi"
3.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Yadav, 1 run","legbreak, outside off, on a length, pushed to long-off for one"
3.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","slows this down, full, on off, pushed to long-off for one"
3.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide",wide down the leg side as he fires this one in
2.6,"Cottrell to Yadav, no run","full, just outside off, slight movement away, resulting in a check drive to short cover"
2.5,"Cottrell to Yadav, FOUR runs","better than the last one because this is not a half-volley. He stands tall, and plays the push-drive on the up, placing it between mid-off and extra cover again"
2.4,"Cottrell to Yadav, FOUR runs",pitched too full. Looking for swing. Ends up bowling a half-volley outside off. Driven between mid-off and extra cover. All along the ground
2.3,"Cottrell to Yadav, no run","this one goes the other way. Might have been seam as this shapes to swing back in, but pitches and keep going with the angle. Hit uppishly to cover-point"
2.2,"Cottrell to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full, swinging in, played with soft hands, dropped into the covers for a single"
2.1,"Cottrell to Yadav, 1 run","just outside off, not enough swing, pushed wide of mid-off for one"
1.6,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, no run","lovely seam bowling. Given out lbw but my initial reaction is heading down leg. Rohit reviews. On a length, on off, Rohit drives, and the ball jags back in after pitching. The only questions is, is it doing too much? I think it is. HawkEye thinks it is. Rohit is reinstated"
1.5,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, no run","short of a length, straight, holds its line, defended back to him"
1.4,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","another lovely shot. Just short of a length, he stays back and punches this along the ground past the man diving at cover-point"
1.3,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, no run","holds its line after pitching just short of a length, Rohit has to defend it"
1.2,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, no run","short of a length, seaming in, hits him high on the pad"
1.1,"Shami to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","5000 IPL runs for Rohit Sharma. Wide outswinger, he throws his bat at it, times it well, but it goes in the air between cover-point and cover. Kings XI excited for a moment"
0.6,"Cottrell to Yadav, no run","a wicket-maiden after that 30-run over. On a length, around off, angles away. Defended to off"
0.5,"Cottrell to de Kock, OUT","special bowling. Thirty runs in his last over. Five balls, no runs and a wicket in this. Lovely seam position angling towards slip, pitches on a length, on middle and leg, drawing a shot across the line, and then swinging late to beat him and hit the timber. The Cottrell salute is alive and well"
0.4,"Cottrell to de Kock, no run","short of a length, nicely punched away, but straight to cover-point"
0.3,"Cottrell to de Kock, no run","full now, gets swing, bowls really full, 128ks, dug out back to him"
0.2,"Cottrell to de Kock, no run","short of a length, outside off, pushed with an open face to cover-point"
0.1,"Cottrell to de Kock, no run","starts with a length ball outside off, squeezes under his attempt to cut, and dies on its way to Rahul"
19.6,"Kuldeep to Tom Curran, FOUR runs","finds the extra cover boundary. Nicely placed. Tossed up outside off, steps out to make it to the pitch of that and it's a clean connection on the lofted drive"
19.5,"Kuldeep to Rajpoot, 1 run","good length at middle stump, steps out and drives aerially towards long-on"
19.4,"Kuldeep to Rajpoot, no run","good length at middle stump, inside edge onto the pads as he looks to force it off the back foot"
19.3,"Kuldeep to Rajpoot, SIX runs",pumps him straight! Doesn't allow this wrong'un to turn. Jumps out to the pitch of it and uses his reach to cart that
19.2,"Kuldeep to Rajpoot, no run",beaten on the drive. Wrong'un spinning away from off stump
19.1,"Kuldeep to Rajpoot, no run",beaten on the sweep. Good length ball wide outside off and he gave it the full swing
18.6,"Narine to Tom Curran, SIX runs","swipes it over deep midwicket for his fifty. Quiet little innings until now from Curran, who came in at 7 today. Waited it till the last couple of overs to start taking on the bowlers and it's, all things considered, a well paced 50"
18.5,"Narine to Tom Curran, SIX runs",well connected again. Good length and sliding on outside off. Steps out and goes straight. A bit low on the bat but it's gone 89 metres
18.4,"Narine to Tom Curran, 2 runs","short outside off, sliced over the bowler off the back foot"
18.3,"Narine to Tom Curran, no run","short and wide outside off, under-edge on the attempted cut, back down the pitch"
18.2,"Narine to Tom Curran, no run","good length outside off, slogs along the floor to deep midwicket and refuses the single"
18.1,"Narine to Tom Curran, SIX runs",over wide long-on and a good looking shot too. Short of a good length. Steps out and that sits up for him with some extra pace to swing at. Swing he does
17.6,"Kuldeep to Unadkat, OUT","finds deep midwicket. Dropped short at middle stump, gets deep in the crease and pulls aerially. Nagarkoti with an easy take in the deep but Unadkat thinks that has hit the spider cam cable in the air. Which would make it a dead ball. It's been sent upstairs. There is a ripple from spider cam's angle. A bit more vague from all the other angles. So the umpires tell him to walk. Not conclusive"

16.1,"Varun to Unadkat, no run","full at middle stump, pushed into the leg side off the front foot"
15.6,"Kuldeep to Tom Curran, 2 runs","wrong'un, full on off stump. Picks that and drives with the turn to sweeper's right"
15.5,"Kuldeep to Unadkat, 1 leg bye","wrong'un, full at middle stump. Looks for the paddle sweep, deflected into the point region off the forearm"
15.4,"Kuldeep to Unadkat, no run","good length outside off, turning in sharply as he gets forward to defend. Off the inside edge to midwicket"
15.3,"Kuldeep to Unadkat, 2 runs","wrong'un, good  length at middle. Down for the sweep and gets it to long leg's right off the under-edge"

14.5,"Varun to Tom Curran, 1 run","short and just outside off, chopped to backward point"
14.4,"Varun to Archer, OUT","oh sensational Nagarkoti! Good length ball wide outside off, looks to launch him straight again but this one grips and holds its line. It's sliced up, between long-off and long-on who are converging. Nagarkoti is the man coming from long-on. The ball's swerving in the direction of long-off. He simply sprints in front of that man and then leaps, almost parallel to the floor, to his left to hold on to that"
14.3,"Varun to Archer, no run","cuts through his defences with a googly. Pitching on a good length, and he's playing back. Between bat and pad and even the keeper can't hang on"
14.2,"Varun to Archer, SIX runs","sixah Jofra. Full and wide outside off, step forward and swing through the line to launch this over long-off"
14.1,"Varun to Tom Curran, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper"
13.6,"Narine to Archer, no run","good length on middle stump, defended off the back foot"
13.5,"Narine to Gopal, OUT","appeal for catch behind is turned down and DK reviews. Was looking for the reverse whip against a middle stump ball. Looks like it took his glove, went onto pad and then lobbed up for the keeper who took it high to his right. Replays are more or less confirming that right now. That will be overturned"
13.4,"Narine to Tom Curran, 1 run",good length and ripping in from outside off. Steps out and cuts to sweeper cover
13.3,"Narine to Gopal, 1 run","short at middle stump, shuffles and flicks to deep square off the back foot"
13.2,"Narine to Tom Curran, 1 run","good length on leg stump, steps out and flicks to midwicket"

11.6,"Narine to Gopal, no run","good length at middle stump, defended to short third off the outside edge"
11.5,"Narine to Tom Curran, 1 run","good length outside off, shuffles and looks to sweep. Cops it on the front thigh"
11.4,"Narine to Tom Curran, FOUR runs","dropped short outside off, backs away and whips this firmly to sweeper's right. Cummins mistimes the slide and that's through from under him"

10.6,"Varun to Gopal, 1 run","good length on middle stump, turning. Flicked to deep square"
10.5,"Varun to Tewatia, OUT","knocks middle stump! Good line from Chakravarthy and slowed it down nicely as well. It's a googly. Pitching leg stump, gripping and rising up at middle as Tewatia walks into the leg side to try and make room for a drive through cover. Gets too far away from it and is beaten on the outside edge"
10.4,"Varun to Tom Curran, 1 run","good length on middle, steps out and tucks it through midwicket"

9.4,"Nagarkoti, to Tewatia, 2 runs",short of a good length and wide outside off. 134.7kph. Slapped on the up to sweeper's elft

9.2,"Nagarkoti, to Tewatia, 2 runs","good length outside off, neatly driven on the up past mid-off. Long-on sprints across to clean that up"

8.6,"Shivam Mavi to Tewatia, 2 runs","slower ball, a full toss dipping outside off. Gets low and drags this wide of mid-on with a check"

8.2,"Shivam Mavi to Tom Curran, 2 runs","good length outside off, sweet sweet timing on this cover drive on the rise. Dribbles to sweeper's right"

7.6,"Nagarkoti, to Tom Curran, 1 run","full outside off, 143kph, driven along the floor to sweeper cover. Bottom hand comes off as he does it"
7.5,"Nagarkoti, to Tom Curran, no run",full and at the stumps of the new batsman. Punched to mid-on
7.4,"Nagarkoti, to Parag, OUT","taken low at backward point! Very sharp from Gill, low to his left if he's taken this. Soft signal is out. Short ball outside off is laced off the back foot with an open face. It's quick and low to Gill's left. He keeps his eye on it, lunges low and in front. Appears like he has taken it cleanly too. Clean enough not to be overturned, anyway. That will stay out"
7.3,"Nagarkoti, to Parag, no run","good length at off, defended down the pitch"
7.2,"Nagarkoti, to Tewatia, 1 run","good length and just outside off, chopped to third man"
7.1,"Nagarkoti, to Uthappa, OUT","finds deep square with precision! The man is in to save the second on a big boundary.This is a short ball, and Uthappa swipes right across his front leg, about chest height before it dips into that fielder's lap"
6.6,"Shivam Mavi to Parag, no run","good length outside off, opens the face and jabs to backward point"
6.5,"Shivam Mavi to Uthappa, 1 run","good length outside off, driven on the up to sweeper cover"
6.4,"Shivam Mavi to Parag, 1 run","good length and angled into the corridor. Pushes on the front foot, thick inside edge to fine leg"
6.3,"Shivam Mavi to Parag, no run","good length at off, poked into the covers with soft hands"
6.2,"Shivam Mavi to Parag, no run","good length on off stump, defended off the front foot"
6.1,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, OUT","taken at short third man! This is a captain's gamble paying off. Cummins and Mavi were given the job to just get the top order out it seems, because this is the sixth consecutive over of pace. And it has yielded Buttler's wicket. Nothing too special about the ball itself - good length and wide outside off. Has a slash on the up, half a stride in on it. Thick edge and straight to the man there"
5.6,"Cummins to Uthappa, no run","good length and just outside off, defended down the pitch"
5.5,"Cummins to Uthappa, no run",mean bouncer in the corridor. He's late on the hook
5.4,"Cummins to Uthappa, no run",just short of backward point. Good length at 146kph on leg stump. Closes the face too early on the flick
5.3,"Cummins to Buttler, 1 run","good length at middle stump, punched to cover's right. A fumble as he lunges low"
5.2,"Cummins to Buttler, no run","good length and just outside off, punched to extra cover"
5.1,"Cummins to Buttler, 2 leg byes",follows him down leg and crashes this full ball into his pads as he looks to flick
4.6,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, 1 run","good length and wide outside off, looks to cart it through the off side after making room. Thick inside edge into the leg side"
4.5,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, no run","beaten as that gets big on him. Short and outside off, climbing up at 135kph. Got a little inside the line as this wobbled away from his back foot punch"
4.4,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, onto the front foot and spanks it through cover. Attempted slower ball? That was at 123kph. Looks like an offcutter"
4.3,"Shivam Mavi to Uthappa, 1 run","oh that was close for a run-out at the striker's end! Short of a good length just outside off, opens the face and drops it in front of backward point with soft hands and Nagarkoti is rapid as he gets low and has an under-arm flick. Would have got Buttler with a direct hit"
4.2,"Shivam Mavi to Uthappa, no run","good length and just outside off, pushed into the covers on the up"
4.1,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, OUT","dragged to midwicket! Short of a good length, climbing up at a middle stump line. 135kph. He goes across the line for the front-foot pull, but that gets a bit steep by the end. Off the sticker region of the bat and a gentle catch offered"
3.6,"Cummins to Buttler, no run",beaten as this bouncer whistles past his right shoulder
3.5,"Cummins to Buttler, SIX runs",ramps him fine! Full and in at leg stump. He was already dropping the shoulder and moving into the off side for the ramp. Possibly just anticipating the angle in that Cummins is providing. But this also happens to be full and down leg side so it all adds up beautifully and the ball slams into the sponsor's hoarding
3.4,"Cummins to Samson, 1 run",short of a good length and into the body. Uses the angled to swish towards fine leg
3.3,"Cummins to Samson, no run","short of a good length, just outside off. Defended to mid-on off the back foot"
3.2,"Cummins to Samson, no run","good length at off stump, 145.7kph, defended to mid-on from the crease"
3.1,"Cummins to Samson, 2 runs",sweet. Good length and outside off. Half a stride and an aesthetic drive on the up to mid-off's left. Russell chases and pulls it in
2.6,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, 1 run","short of a length, nipping in off the seam. Inside edge onto pad and a single in the covers as he looks to punch on the up"
2.5,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, no run",beaten on the inside edge as he looks to pull from outside off. Good length skidder angled into the corridor
2.4,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, no run","good length just outside off, knocked on the up to extra cover"
2.3,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, FOUR runs",yawn. Good length and angled into the pads. Waits on it and holds his shape to clip this past short fine
2.2,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, 1 leg bye","good length outside off, 131.1kph, skips into line for the flick but cops it on the pad"
2.1,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, no run","good length outside off, looks to punch into the covers. Gets a thick inside edge to midwicket"
1.6,"Cummins to Smith, OUT","given out caught behind now. Smith looks confused, has a chat with Jos, and then walks off. It's a good length ball in at leg stump. His front foot is well in the leg side and he's had another ungainly hoick at this. Inside edge past leg stump and taken low to the left by DK. Strange sequence of shots from Smith leading up to that dismissal"
1.5,"Cummins to Smith, 2 runs","just clears mid-off. Good length ball at middle, ugly heave from Smith across the line and he only ends up slicing it"
1.4,"Cummins to Smith, no run",edged? No says the umpire. KKR won't review. Short of a good length at middle stump straightening on him as he looks to flick. There was a sound as this was near Smith. Do KKR think it was pad? Was a bit more woody in my opinion 
1.3,"Cummins to Smith, no run",beaten. Shuffles into the off side against this back of a length ball and has a swipe as it climbs over the outside edge
1.2,"Cummins to Smith, no run","good length and just outside off, defended to midwicket off the back foot"
1.1,"Cummins to Buttler, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked along the floor to deep square"
0.6,"Narine to Smith, 2 leg byes","good length and wide outside off, gets down for the sweep, it deflects off his back thigh and rolls away behind the keeper"
0.5,"Narine to Buttler, 1 run","good length, turning in at middle stump. Tucked towards long-on off the back foot"
0.4,"Narine to Buttler, SIX runs",sweet little swipe over wide long-on. Narine telegraphs this - offbreak at length on an off stump line. Buttler knows where it's going to land and he skips down to meet it there and then shovels it
0.3,"Narine to Smith, 1 run","good length, offbreak at off stump. Well forward before turning this to deep square"
0.2,"Narine to Buttler, 1 run","good length on middle stump, flicked to square leg"
0.2,"Narine to Buttler, 1 wide","short and down leg side, beaten on the flick"
0.1,"Narine to Buttler, no run","good length and just outside off, punched to backward point off the back foot"
19.6,"Tom Curran to Morgan, no run","yorker outside off, drilled back towards the bowler who sits down and holds on his follow through"
19.5,"Tom Curran to Morgan, 2 runs","yorker outside off, jammed down to long-off and Nagarkoti is back for another second"
19.5,"Tom Curran to Morgan, 1 wide",and again. Morgan keeps shuffling and drawing this line from Curran. This one is full and too wide outside off again
19.5,"Tom Curran to Morgan, 1 wide","wide yorker outside off, just past the tramline as Morgan looks to chop it"
19.5,"Tom Curran to Morgan, 1 wide","slower ball, full and very very wide as Morgan waits for this after settling outside off stump"
19.4,"Tom Curran to Morgan, 2 runs","low full toss outside off, driven firmly to long-off's left. Nagarkoti comes back for the second and survives as Curran hopes Smith's throw hits the stumps direct"
19.3,"Tom Curran to Morgan, SIX runs",clears deep midwicket. Short ball across the corridor. Might have been a slower one too. He waited on that and put the weight into his pull very late despite being on his toes. Expertly lifted
19.2,"Tom Curran to Morgan, 2 runs",low full toss across his off stump. Walks into that and hammers it flat-batted to long-off's left. Smith sprints across and drags it in with his left hand
19.1,"Tom Curran to Nagarkoti,, 1 run","good length, slower ball at leg stump. Inside edge onto thigh, out towards short fine"
18.6,"Rajpoot to Nagarkoti,, 1 run","full slower ball on leg stump, whipped out to deep square"
18.5,"Rajpoot to Morgan, 1 run","good length and just outside off, chopped to short third man"
18.4,"Rajpoot to Nagarkoti,, 1 run","good length on middle stump, pushed to long-on"
18.3,"Rajpoot to Nagarkoti,, FOUR runs","full outside off, lines that up and drills it straight over mid-off. Proper connection on that swing"
18.2,"Rajpoot to Morgan, 1 run","slower short ball just outside off, chopped on the bounce to short third"
18.1,"Rajpoot to Nagarkoti,, 1 run","yorker outside off, jammed down to long-on"
17.6,"Tom Curran to Cummins, OUT","taken at deep backward square by Samson. Got into a tangle running to his right, because Royals insist their deep fielders are in from the rope when Cummins is batting. So he runs to his right at an awkward angle and is actually nearly facing the boundary line as he leaps up and takes it just above his head. As he lands, he hits the back of his head onto the floor. The medical team have a chat with him and he's alright it seems. This was a slower short ball outside off and a bit of a blind hook from Cummins, only managed to slice it"
17.5,"Tom Curran to Morgan, 1 run",good length and just outside off. Slower ball sitting up. Slapped to long-off's left
17.4,"Tom Curran to Cummins, 1 run","low full toss at middle stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
17.3,"Tom Curran to Morgan, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, chopped to sweeper cover"
17.2,"Tom Curran to Morgan, FOUR runs",knee high full toss nice and wide outside off. Morgan cuts loose and whacks it to sweeper's left
17.1,"Tom Curran to Cummins, 1 run","slower ball, short of a good length on middle. Flicked to deep square"
16.6,"Archer to Morgan, SIX runs","dropped at deep backward point! Again, the plan is executed for the wicket at deep backward point. But this time Curran loses it to his right. Short and across him, and Morgan uses the upper cut. Just uses the pace though, not much of a swat at that. Curran is on the line but apprehensive as he goes for this to his right. It was about chest height"
16.5,"Archer to Cummins, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, jabbed into the covers"
16.4,"Archer to Cummins, FOUR runs","punched to Samson's right at sweeper. He's in from the line a long way, halfway. This is a slower ball and a short one. Nicely on top of that to punch firmly in front of square"
16.3,"Archer to Morgan, 1 run",146kph bouncer up at the throat. Takes the eyes off and fends it into the square leg region
16.2,"Archer to Cummins, 1 run","short and just outside off, opens the face and turns it to third man"
16.1,"Archer to Morgan, 1 run","short at the body, pulled out to deep square"
15.6,"Tom Curran to Morgan, 1 run","slower short ball at leg stump, controlled pull out to deep square"
15.5,"Tom Curran to Cummins, 1 run","good length, slower ball at leg stump. Clipped to deep midwicket"
15.4,"Tom Curran to Cummins, 2 runs","slower ball, good length on off stump. Gets forward and tucks delicately into vacant midwicket to steal two"
15.3,"Tom Curran to Morgan, 1 run","low full toss on off stump, slapped across the line, on the bounce to deep midwicket"
15.2,"Tom Curran to Morgan, 2 runs","slower ball, short and wide outside off. Steps out and is forced to adjust on the cut. To sweeper's left"
15.1,"Tom Curran to Morgan, no run","good length on off stump, defended to point off the front foot"
14.6,"Rajpoot to Cummins, no run","short of a good length, wide outside off. Hapless slog and he's well beaten"
14.5,"Rajpoot to Morgan, 1 run","slower ball at off stump, punched on the up to long-off"
14.4,"Rajpoot to Cummins, 1 run","short of a good length in the corridor, opens the face and runs it to third man"
14.3,"Rajpoot to Morgan, 1 leg bye",was that off the helmet?  Looks like it. Bouncer up at the crest at 127kph. Morgan beaten on the attempted hook. Takes off his helmet at the other end and is all smiles. Was beaten by a lack of pace there
14.3,"Rajpoot to Morgan, 1 wide","bouncer down leg side, beaten on the pull"
14.3,"Rajpoot to Morgan, 1 wide","short and down leg side, left alone"
14.2,"Rajpoot to Russell, OUT","taken at deep backward point! This is a plan coming off. Rajpoot goes full and wide outside off. Reaching out and throwing his hands at this, but it's sliced off the outside part of the bat. Russell's holding his head. Well, his helmet.He obviously thinks that should have been somewhere over extra cover. But the plan with the fielder out there has worked out for Royals"
14.1,"Rajpoot to Russell, SIX runs",see ya. That is not a length Rajpoot can afford to bowl at his pace. Short of a good length and he's got the front foot stride to slug this over deep midwicket from outside off
14.1,"Rajpoot to Russell, 1 wide","full and very wide outside off, left alone. That cut back in to sail over the wide line"
13.6,"Archer to Morgan, no run",beaten on the attempted ramp. Short and rising at an off stump line. Stays leg side of it and opens the face but it's too quick
13.5,"Archer to Russell, 1 run","good length slower ball, at the stumps. Shuffles and exposes the stumps before poking it past the non-striker"
13.4,"Archer to Morgan, 1 run","good length on leg stump, nudged to mid-on's left off the back foot"
13.3,"Archer to Morgan, no run",beaten. Short and across the corridor and skidding rapidly underneath the attempted cut
13.2,"Archer to Morgan, no run","good length at 148kph, defended on the front foot"
13.1,"Archer to Karthik, OUT",taken behind! 147.3kph. Good length in the corridor. Karthik deep in the crease looking to defend. It's an angled bat coming down towards midwicket. Manages to brush the outside edge
12.6,"Gopal to Russell, 2 runs",safely to sweeper's right. Good length and dipping wide outside off. Russell wants to go over extra cover after getting down on a knee. Ends up slicing it high
12.5,"Gopal to Russell, SIX runs","clears the midwicket boundary with ease again. Full and slid on at leg stump. Never going to survive that as a bowler. Casual whip, not much height on it, and to the deep fielder's left"
12.4,"Gopal to Russell, no run","short and wide outside off, cut straight to extra cover"
12.3,"Gopal to Russell, SIX runs","smoked into the railings. Good length ball, a googly at middle and leg. Front leg into the leg side and a brutal slog sweep over deep midwicket"
12.2,"Gopal to Karthik, 1 run","good length on off stump, driven with the turn to sweeper cover"
12.1,"Gopal to Russell, 1 run","googly, short and in at off stump. Dragged to deep midwicket's right with a pull"
11.6,"Archer to Karthik, no run","good length and at off stump, 147.8kph. Defended off the back foot"
11.5,"Archer to Russell, 1 run","slower ball, short and into the body. Pulled to deep midwicket"
11.4,"Archer to Russell, no run","beaten. 148.7kph, short and just outside off. Russell hurriedly backing into the leg side and having a swish, out of balance"
11.3,"Archer to Russell, no run",149.7kph bouncer in the corridor. Russell gets his head into the leg side to let that go
11.2,"Archer to Russell, no run",full and just outside off at 149.4kph. Deep in the crease and respectfully defended
11.1,"Archer to Gill, OUT","takes it himself, pitch side. Good length ball at leg stump. Kicks up a bit of dust off the surface. Gill looks for the leg glance off his thigh but has closed the face too soon. Leading edge hangs up in the air and Archer completes a simple catch"
10.6,"Gopal to Gill, 1 run","short and turning away outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
10.5,"Gopal to Gill, no run","googly, short of a good length and in at off. Cut to backward point"
10.4,"Gopal to Russell, 1 run","googly at a length on leg stump, clipped to short fine off the back foot"
10.3,"Gopal to Russell, no run",raps the pads with a googly. Good length and tucking him up on the crease as he attempts the whip behind square
10.2,"Gopal to Gill, 1 run","short outside off, cut straight to sweeper cover"
10.1,"Gopal to Gill, FOUR runs",misfield by Jofra at long-on. Full and front-of-the-hand quicker one. Just outside off. He's to the pitch of that and crunches it down the ground. Archer extends his left hand but can't muster the balance to come back up with the ball in hand
9.6,"Tewatia to Rana, OUT","holes out to long-off! Another page in the Tewatia story. Goes over the wicket now, fuller and flatter. Possibly seam up. Rana miscues the attempted loft-drive into the off side. It's off the low part of the bat"
9.5,"Tewatia to Gill, 1 run","good length on leg stump, whipped to deep midwicket"
9.4,"Tewatia to Rana, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut straight to backward point"
9.3,"Tewatia to Rana, FOUR runs","beats sweeeper to his right. Short and just outside off, waits on that and chops firmly to evade Samson's big dive"
9.2,"Tewatia to Rana, no run","short and sliding away outside off, beaten on the cut"
9.1,"Tewatia to Rana, no run","beaten on the reverse shot. Good length and turning into the corridor. Wanted to hoick behind third man but was a bit too quick with getting in position for that. Lost his bearings, flicked his thigh on the way to Buttler. Or was it glove? Yes it was!"
8.6,"Gopal to Gill, FOUR runs","over the non-striker. Good length and wide outside off. Steps out and once again, just tremendous use of his reach to drag this towards the leg side even as it threatens to turn away from him"
8.5,"Gopal to Gill, no run","good length outside off, driven back to the bowler"
8.4,"Gopal to Gill, 2 runs","safely into the turf at mid-off. Good length, wide outside off, attempted sweep and it's a top edge that evades Smith running back from extra cover by some distance"
8.3,"Gopal to Gill, FOUR runs","oh what a shot. Pure improv. Good length slider in at middle and leg. He's on the front foot for a pull but realises this will stay a tad low. Adjusts the swing, makes it a short-arm one, and bisects deep square and deep midwicket"
8.2,"Gopal to Gill, no run","short and just outside off, cut straight to backward point"
8.1,"Gopal to Gill, no run","short and just outside off, mistimed cut to extra cover"
7.6,"Parag to Gill, 1 run","good length just outside off, slides on nicely for the flick to deep midwicket"
7.5,"Parag to Gill, 2 runs","full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket's left"
7.4,"Parag to Rana, 1 run","looks like another legcutter. Good length and sliding in towards middle stump, swept to deep midwicket"
7.3,"Parag to Gill, 1 run","good length and just outside off, dabbed to extra cover's left. Looked like a legcutter"
7.2,"Parag to Rana, 3 runs","short and just outside off, backs away for the cut as this slides into the corridor. Thick edge runs past short third"
7.1,"Parag to Rana, SIX runs","sweetly lofted over the extra cover boundary. Parag starts with an overpitched offbreak, wide outside off. Lovely stride forward and completes the batswing with grace"
6.6,"Gopal to Gill, FOUR runs",finds the midwicket boundary. Attempted front-of-the-hand quicker one from Shreyas. It's dropped short and sits up nicely for a front-foot pull
6.5,"Gopal to Gill, 2 runs","good length and wide outside off, pushed through flat. Reaches out and slaps to sweeper's right"
6.4,"Gopal to Rana, 1 run","just short of deep midwicket. Short and just outside off, a checked pull, in the air briefly"
6.3,"Gopal to Rana, no run","beaten by the googly. Good length and just outside off. Playing for the one spinning in, bat hanging inside the line"
6.2,"Gopal to Rana, 2 runs",leading edge as he looks to flick this full googly from outside off. Curran chases to his right at short third
6.1,"Gopal to Gill, 1 run","googly floated up at off stump, drilled firmly back at the bowler and bursts through his hands to trickle to long-off"
5.6,"Tom Curran to Rana, no run","slower ball again, short and just outside off. Under-edge on the attempted cut. Rolls to the keeper"
5.5,"Tom Curran to Rana, FOUR runs","he thrives on room outside off. And after three tight deliveries, Curran feeds him a wide one. It's also a slower ball and much shorter. Slashed to the backward point boundary"
5.4,"Tom Curran to Rana, no run","good length on off stump, makes him drive towards mid-off again"
5.3,"Tom Curran to Rana, no run","good length at off stump, watchfully defended on the front foot"

4.5,"Unadkat to Narine, OUT","knocks middle and leg stump and lets out a couple of roars. Another good length offcutter, but slightly fuller and slightly straighter than the last one. Narine brings out the slog again but this time he's beaten on the inside edge"
4.4,"Unadkat to Narine, FOUR runs",past extra cover. Short of a good length and slanting into him this time. Backs away and punches it between extra cover and regular cover
4.3,"Unadkat to Narine, SIX runs","nails it. Unadkat bowls Narine's dream ball. Good length, offcutter not very well concealed, just outside off. Spinning into his arc. He has the front foot in the leg side and the full swing sends it over midwicket"
4.2,"Unadkat to Gill, 1 run","good length at off stump, watchfully patted on the up to mid-off"
4.1,"Unadkat to Gill, no run","good length at middle stump, cramped on the punch. It's back down the pitch"

3.4,"Rajpoot to Gill, 1 run","slower ball, short of a good length at middle. Pulled to deep midwicket"
3.3,"Rajpoot to Gill, FOUR runs","past midwicket. Good length ball just outside off, friendly enough pace for Gill to wait on the front foot and pull well in front of the fielder"
3.2,"Rajpoot to Narine, 1 leg bye","good length at leg stump, looks to whip it behind square and is struck on the pad"
3.1,"Rajpoot to Narine, FOUR runs","beats deep midwicket to the left. Good length offcutter at middles stump, clears the front leg and nails the slog along the ground this time. Samson can't stop with a slide"

2.6,"Unadkat to Gill, no run","good length on off stump, punched into the covers"
2.5,"Unadkat to Narine, 1 run","high up and dropped at mid-on! Uthappa puts down a sitter. Full slower ball at middle stump, looks for the big slog and gets it off the toe-end. Uthappa is underneath it and barely has to move. Brings out the reverse cup and simply fluffs it. Might have closed the grasp a bit too early"
2.4,"Unadkat to Gill, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to midwicket"
2.3,"Unadkat to Narine, 1 leg bye","offcutter, good length and cramping him on the pads as he looks to play the flick. Cops that on the body"

1.3,"Rajpoot to Gill, 2 runs","good length at middle stump, allows it on and clips past midwicket"
1.2,"Rajpoot to Gill, SIX runs","lofted over the long-on boundary. Here we go again. Gill and the straight boundary. Full and floated away from him, but he brings an angled bat down and drags it the other way, towards long-on. Half a stride only. It's all about the head position"
1.1,"Rajpoot to Gill, no run","good length and shape away outside off, left alone"
0.6,"Archer to Narine, no run","150.8kph, short and wide outside off. Narine backs into the leg side to make room. He's made too much room. Beaten on the cut"
0.5,"Archer to Narine, no run",149kph and making him hop as this curves away from a middle stump line. It was banged in short too and he was a long way from making connection

19.4,"Ahmed to Nortje, no run","slower ball, on a length, beats him with the offcutter"

19.2,"Ahmed to Rabada, 1 run","back to the yorker, dug out to long-off for one"
19.1,"Ahmed to Rabada, 2 runs",dropped. Khaleel starts with length. Rabada lofts this to long-off where Pandey spills it
18.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Rabada, 1 run","yorker again, and that is another excellent over. Just the single"
18.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rabada, no run","bouncer, to the tall man, so it is not going to be a wide. And it goes above his hook"

18.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Axar Patel, 1 wide",wide down the leg side. Bhuvi predicts Axar might back away so tries to bowl that line to cramp him up. Axar stays his ground
18.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rabada, 1 run","yorker again, played back at him, misfielded by Bhuvneshwar, allows him the single"
18.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rabada, FOUR runs","full toss, at the stumps, lofted with an open face, between long-off and extra cover. Gets four for it"
18.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Axar Patel, 1 run","misses the yorker by inches, driven to long-off for one"
17.6,"Natarajan to Stoinis, OUT","another lovely yorker, given lbw but I think he will get it reviewed and overturned because of the angle. He is beaten after shuffling across, but this is bowled over the wicket and has hit him in front of off. Has to be missing. But it is not. The replay shows it to be swinging back in. That is surprising, but I am not going to question the technology here. I got it wrong unlike Natarajan who has been nailing his yorkers"
17.5,"Natarajan to Stoinis, 2 runs","gets the yorker wrong, but it is a straight full toss that cramps him up. The mis-hit doesn't carry to square leg boundary rider, and they come back for two"
17.4,"Natarajan to Axar Patel, 1 run",and he nails another yorker. Just the single to long-off
17.3,"Natarajan to Stoinis, 1 run",yorker again. Can't do much more than dig it out for one. Natarajan has been excellent with the yorker. Is there no dew tonight?

16.4,"Rashid Khan to Pant, OUT","oh Pant tries the impossible shot. Rashid has slowed this down and bowled full on middle and leg. He wants to go behind square with the sweep, but he doesn't have pace to work with. Ends up sweeping this to deep square leg"

16.2,"Rashid Khan to Pant, 1 run","in his sweeping arc, he hits to deep square leg for another single"

15.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, FOUR runs","powerful strike. On a length, just outside off. Pant tries nothing fancy here. Just a full-blooded extra cover drive. Over the man in the ring"

15.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, 1 run",driven to wide long-off for one
15.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Hetmyer, OUT","wicket for Bhuvi on his comeback. He continues with the strategy of keeping it wide of Hetmyer's reach. Slower offcutter too. He still goes after this length ball, lofting it towards wide long-off. Pandey runs to his right to complete the catch despite a wobble"

14.3,"Ahmed to Hetmyer, SIX runs","full toss, into the pads, and he loves it. Yorker gone wrong, but the line is better off wider. Lofted over midwicket. DC are in this"
14.2,"Ahmed to Hetmyer, no run","low full toss, dug out to mid-off"
14.1,"Ahmed to Hetmyer, 2 runs","short slower ball, wide again, Hetmyer does well to get bat on it, but doesn't get any power. Somehow it sails over extra cover, and Warner from long-off has to run to his right to keep it down to two"
14.1,"Ahmed to Hetmyer, 1 wide","wide length ball, goes over the tram line. Trying to stay away from his reach. Called for it"
13.6,"Natarajan to Hetmyer, 1 run","lovely yorker, on leg, Hetmyer is not getting this anywhere. Dug out for just the single"

13.2,"Natarajan to Pant, 4 leg byes","full toss down the leg side, lucky to get away with just the four. Off the inside edge and past the diving Bairstow. That could have been his third straight six. Called leg-byes. He possibly missed it altogether"
13.1,"Natarajan to Hetmyer, 1 run","full, straight, nearly a yorker, dug out back over the bowler's head"
12.6,"Abhishek to Pant, SIX runs","like the London buses, you get one after the other. Lovely flat six over wide long-off. They will need much more of this"
12.5,"Abhishek to Pant, SIX runs",Pant's first six of this IPL. He slog-sweeps him over the longer boundary. Clean connection

11.6,"Rashid Khan to Pant, no run","big swing, but gets an inside edge back to Rashid"

11.3,"Rashid Khan to S Dhawan, OUT","wrong'un outside off, and Dhawan tries the slog sweep only to be beaten. Bairstow appeals both for catch and stumping. Given not out, and they review it. So I assume the appeal is now for the catch. And it has hit the toe end of the bat. Great review. Dhawan has to go"
11.2,"Rashid Khan to Pant, 1 run","full, on the pads, worked to deep square for one"

7.2,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, OUT","slower through the air, and Iyer has thrown it away. He goes for a loft with an open face, and there is a fielder in place for that shot. Catching practice there"
7.1,"Rashid Khan to Iyer, no run","quick legbreak first up, 97ks, beats him as he defends"
6.6,"Abhishek to Iyer, 1 run","again the front-of-the-hand delivery. Short of a length, but surprises Iyer with no spin. He recovers well to pull him to deep midwicket"

5.1,"Natarajan to Iyer, no run","short of a length, not much room, punched to cover-point"
4.6,"Ahmed to Iyer, 3 runs","does the double movement again: shuffle across, then back away. Cuts the slower ball in front of square and into the gap between cover-point and extra cover. Easy three there"

16.3,"Stoinis to Williamson, FOUR runs","Dhawan has been lobbed. This is the work of that running early on as the fielders are off the fence, but in the last four overs you expect them to go back to the fence. Williamson has cleared Dhawan at deep square, but the ball still falls inside the fence"
16.2,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 1 run","full toss, and he has just helped it along for a single. No back lift. Could have attempted to hit a six here"
16.1,"Stoinis to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, opens the face, straight to short extra"
15.6,"Nortje to Williamson, 1 run",pulled away to deep midwicket this time for one
15.5,"Nortje to Williamson, FOUR runs","wow that is some flourish. Nortje has done well here with a legcutter short of a length and wide of his reach, but Williamson has helioptered it along the ground between mid-off and extra cover"
15.4,"Nortje to Williamson, FOUR runs","lovely shot. He has picked his spot. He knows Nortje is not going to bowl full with the mid-off up. He shuffles across to try to hit it to leg, and ends up pulling it between fine leg and deep square"
15.3,"Nortje to Bairstow, 1 run","short ball, pulled hard, but straight to deep square leg"
15.2,"Nortje to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover"
15.1,"Nortje to Williamson, no run","full and straight, hit to midwicket. His first dot"
14.6,"Rabada to Williamson, 3 runs","bowls full and straight, Williamson hits wide of long-on, who is in off the fence. Stoinis makes a diving save and flicks back a throw even as he falls. Hard enough for the ball to reach inside the circle. There is non one around to collect it so they take three"
14.5,"Rabada to Williamson, 2 runs","Williamson goes over that mid-off, but this is a slower ball, and he hasn't got all of it. Just the couple"
14.4,"Rabada to Bairstow, 1 run","low full toss, 140ks, with mid-off up, he is lucky to get away with just a single. Bairstow doesn't try to go over that man"
14.3,"Rabada to Williamson, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, outside off, punched to deep point"
14.2,"Rabada to Bairstow, 1 run","short, quick, into the body, 139, mis-hits the pull towards long leg"
14.1,"Rabada to Williamson, 1 run","on a length, straight, pushed to long-on for one"
13.6,"Mishra to Williamson, 1 run","dipping full ball, driven to long-off for one more"
13.5,"Mishra to Bairstow, 1 run",looks for the sweep as Mishra bowls the slider. It runs off the glove to short fine leg
13.4,"Mishra to Williamson, 1 run",wrong'un. He picks it off the pitch and punches is down to long-on for one
13.3,"Mishra to Williamson, FOUR runs","lovely shot. All wrists. Wide legbreak, and he plays this like a hockey flick, using his wrists to chip it over extra cover"
13.2,"Mishra to Bairstow, 1 run","full, can't get under it, hit hard to long-off"
13.1,"Mishra to Williamson, 1 run",pushes this straight of straight extra cover for a single
12.6,"Axar Patel to Bairstow, no run","fired in, middle and leg, no pace, and Patel makes an excellent diving save to his right to deny them a single"
12.5,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","short of a length, punched wide of the diving Shaw at extra cover. He gets there but the ball slips under his hand"
12.4,"Axar Patel to Bairstow, 1 run","flat, short of a length, no room, pushed wide of extra cover"
12.3,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","flat, into the pads, worked to leg for one"
12.2,"Axar Patel to Bairstow, 1 run","quicker, outside off, dropped into the covers for one"
12.1,"Axar Patel to Williamson, 1 run","on a length outside off, 92ks, driven to deep cover"
11.6,"Mishra to Williamson, 1 run","slow, really slow, full, driven to long-on for one"
11.5,"Mishra to Bairstow, 1 run","slider, outside off, punched to long-off"
11.4,"Mishra to Bairstow, no run","full, on off, drilled back to him"
11.3,"Mishra to Bairstow, no run","wrong'un, he picks it off the pitch, and plays it back to him"
11.2,"Mishra to Pandey, OUT","slog-sweep against the turn on such a big boundary against Mishra's slow pace? That is a death wish, I am sorry to tell you, Mr Pandey. Mishra also gets some dip on it, and the top edge ends with Rabada at deep midwicket"
11.1,"Mishra to Bairstow, 1 run","nearly a yorker, middle and off, dug out past the diving Mishra to his right"
10.6,"Axar Patel to Bairstow, 1 run",single down the ground
10.5,"Axar Patel to Bairstow, FOUR runs","this is a good example of the benefit of having taken those quick twos. Dhawan at long-on is some way inside the boundary, and Bairstow has managed to pull this wide of him. It is not a had hit bit because the fielder is in, he has managed to beat him"
10.4,"Axar Patel to Pandey, 1 run","slower than usual, still 91ks, pushed into the off side"
10.3,"Axar Patel to Bairstow, 1 run","on a length, some turn from around off, punched wide of long-on"
10.3,"Axar Patel to Bairstow, 1 wide",wide down the leg side. Seems like an arm ball
10.2,"Axar Patel to Pandey, 1 run","flighted outside off, driven to long-off"
10.1,"Axar Patel to Pandey, no run","flat, on a length, on off, punched to short cover"
9.6,"Mishra to Bairstow, FOUR runs",nice shot. Rocks back to cut a flat length ball between point and short third man. Manufactures his own length there
9.5,"Mishra to Bairstow, no run","nice dip, on a length, middle and leg, defended to leg"
9.4,"Mishra to Pandey, 1 run","really full, hit down the ground, to the right of Mishra"
9.3,"Mishra to Warner, OUT","big appeal for a catch at the wicket, not given, and they go upstairs right away. And it has come off the glove. Warner looks for another reverse sweep but this time the ball is not as full as the one that he pulled off two balls ago. Also it doesn't turn and kisses the glove on the way through to Pant. There is a bit of a murmur at the same time on the UltraEdge. So Warner has to go"
9.2,"Mishra to Warner, no run","slider, beats him on the slog outside off as he plays for the turn"
9.1,"Mishra to Warner, FOUR runs","tossed up outside off, but Warner switches his stance to make it his leg side. He gets a nit of a bottom edge but he has managed to place it fine of short fine leg. This is the reverse sweep and not the switch hit"
8.6,"Sharma to Warner, 1 run","full toss, borderline on the no-ball, punched to deep point. It is ruled just below the waist"
8.5,"Sharma to Bairstow, 1 run","on a length, another slower ball, 126ks, on off, he opens the face of the bat for a single"
8.4,"Sharma to Warner, 1 run","short of a length, slower, no room, Warner leaves this in the crease and Bairstow still calls him through for a single"
8.3,"Sharma to Warner, SIX runs","too many slower balls this over. Warner is waiting for them, and clears the front leg to send this full ball back over Ishant's head. It is a wallop"
8.2,"Sharma to Bairstow, 1 run","another slower ball, full outside off, driven to long-off"
8.2,"Sharma to Bairstow, 1 wide",another slower offcutter bowled wide down the leg side
8.1,"Sharma to Bairstow, 2 runs",too straight with the fine leg up. Clipped square of that short fine for two
8.1,"Sharma to Bairstow, 1 wide",wide down the leg side as the offcutter goes wrong
7.6,"Stoinis to Warner, no run","slower offcutter, 121ks, leading edge from Warner, but it lands short of short cover"
7.5,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 1 run",Bairstow makes room to go back over his head but doesn't get enough timing behind it
7.4,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 2 runs","on a length, quick, angling in, and they hustle through for another second by hitting slightly wide of long-on with soft hands"
7.3,"Stoinis to Warner, 1 run","on a length, no room, he opens the face to hit to deep point for one"
7.2,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 1 run","full outside off, hit hard to long-off so they get just the one"
7.1,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 2 runs","on a length, on off, and they pinch a third straight couple. Soft hands here. They know it is not easy to hit boundaries here"
6.6,"Mishra to Warner, 2 runs","wrong'un, starts outside leg, and Warner uses soft hands again to pinch a two in the leg side"
6.5,"Mishra to Warner, 2 runs","slider, middle and leg, pushed with soft hands to long-on and they come back for two"
6.4,"Mishra to Bairstow, 1 run","shimmies down, Mishra slows it down, shortens the length, draws a defensive shot after beating him in the flight"
6.3,"Mishra to Bairstow, SIX runs",lovely shot. Bairstow getting his bearings now. Mishra tosses up a legbreak but pitches it right in his slot. He slogs it over wide mid-on
6.2,"Mishra to Bairstow, 2 runs",paddle sweep from right in front of the stumps. Mishra's slow pace means this won't go for four
6.1,"Mishra to Warner, 1 run",single down to long-off as this length ball turns back into Warner and he goes back to punch it against the turn
5.6,"Nortje to Warner, 1 run","slower ball, middle and leg, dropped into the leg side for one"
5.5,"Nortje to Warner, FOUR runs","these are fortunate runs. Quick length ball, skids through under his shot. Oh it gets a bottom edge onto the thigh pad, and it beats short third man"
5.4,"Nortje to Warner, SIX runs","and now he seems to have got a hang of the pace of the pitch. Slower ball, just a touch too full, Warner clears the front leg, delays his shot, and goes over extra cover"
5.3,"Nortje to Bairstow, 1 leg bye","quick, on a length, 143ks, looks for the pick-up. Bairstow looks to play the pick-up shot to leg, but gets an inside edge onto the pad"
5.2,"Nortje to Warner, 1 run",hit straight to deep point
5.1,"Nortje to Bairstow, 1 run","this pitch is surely slower than the ones we have seen. Bairstow escapes. Looks for a slog over mid-on, but the ball is slow and he is early into the shot. Iyer has to run in and dive, and can't make the catch"
4.6,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 1 leg bye","we have a review for an lbw after they gave him not out on the field. Short of a length but Bairstow fancies the pull and is hit in front on the back pad. Height is the only thing saving him here, and the replay shows the ball clipping the top of the middle stump. So the on-field decision stays even though DC retain their review"
4.5,"Stoinis to Warner, 1 run",hits a full ball to extra cover and just about makes a risky single. Was gone if Iyer had hit
4.4,"Stoinis to Bairstow, 1 run","again he mis-times. Skips down this time, but doesn't get all of it. Just the single to midwicket"
4.3,"Stoinis to Bairstow, no run",another inside edge onto the pad. Clear signs the ball is not coming on. Another accurate slower ball
4.2,"Stoinis to Warner, 1 run","short of a length, no room, pushed wide of mid-on for one"
4.1,"Stoinis to Warner, no run","tries to hit a length ball on the up, but straight to mid-on"
3.6,"Nortje to Bairstow, no run","early signs of the ball not coming on? Bairstow has swung hard through the line of a length ball, but has hit it straight to mid-on. Doesn't go as fast as full-blooded swings from Bairstow's bat do"
3.5,"Nortje to Bairstow, no run","bouncer, wicket to wicket, Bairstow ducks under it"
3.4,"Nortje to Warner, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, pushed wide of mid-on for another single"
3.3,"Nortje to Bairstow, 1 run","short of a length, seams in from just outside off, the inside edge hits his pad. Lucky to not play on"
3.2,"Nortje to Warner, 1 run","short, 134ks, cramping him up, pulled down to deep square leg"
3.1,"Nortje to Warner, no run","on a length, just outside off, angling in, punched to extra cover"
2.6,"Sharma to Warner, 1 run","on a length, hardly any room, gets a single into the off side"
2.5,"Sharma to Bairstow, 1 run","wide length ball, but he has deep point in place just for this"
2.4,"Sharma to Bairstow, no run","another slower ball, seems like the legcutter, stump to stump, on a length. Defended"
2.3,"Sharma to Warner, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, on the pads, worked to leg"
2.2,"Sharma to Warner, no run","on a length, no room, punched hard to mid-off"
2.1,"Sharma to Warner, no run","slower ball, back of a length, just outside off, punched to cover"
1.6,"Rabada to Bairstow, no run","full toss on the thigh, 142ks, for the best part of its journey it seems like it will be a no-ball, but it dips and hits him on the thigh pad. Or has it missed the padding?"
1.5,"Rabada to Bairstow, no run","quick delivery, 144ks, Bairstow is hit on the inner half of the bat as he looks to drive away from the body"
1.4,"Rabada to Warner, 1 run","on pace, on length, middle and off, angling across, driven square, to the right of cover-point. They steal the single"
1.3,"Rabada to Warner, no run","slower ball, Warner delays his shot, but can't find the gap. Hits this length ball straight to cover"
1.2,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR runs","shovels a full ball over mid-on. Not the most elegant of shots, but he has managed to get enough behind it to clear mid-on"
1.1,"Rabada to Warner, no run","full and straight, hit to mid-on"
0.6,"Sharma to Warner, 1 run","driven on the up, wide of mid-off, for a single"
0.5,"Sharma to Bairstow, 3 runs","wide length ball, punched on the up, square of third man. Shaw has to put in a dive to prevent the boundary"
0.4,"Sharma to Bairstow, 2 runs","full, shaping in, just a push past mid-on for a couple"
0.3,"Sharma to Warner, 1 run","slight swing away, on a length, around off, runs off the thick outside edge for a single to square third man"
0.2,"Sharma to Warner, 2 runs","short of a length, starts around leg, shapes away to off, punched between point and cover-point"
0.1,"Sharma to Warner, no run",some seam first up as Warner shimmies down the track and leaves it alone outside off
19.6,"Udana to Pollard, FOUR runs","it's a tie! A super over! Unreal. Slower short ball and that is well, completely predictable. Sits up at off stump. Pollard deep in the crease and clobbers this between deep square and deep midwicket. One bounce and over the rope"
19.5,"Udana to Ishan, OUT","taken at deep midwicket! Oh boy! A matter of yards from victory, a matter of yards from an IPL hundred. Slower length ball outside off, gets down on a knee and brings out the slog sweep. Flat and right into the lap of the fielder at the line. Have they crossed over? That is all that matters right now"
19.4,"Udana to Ishan, SIX runs","nails it and he's up to 99! Kishan has connected one and dragged this wide of long-on so casually! An overpitched ball from Udana, sliding nicely on as he swipes across the line"
19.3,"Udana to Ishan, SIX runs","tipped over the boundary at long-on! Looks like it's Gurkeerat. Low full toss outside off, slogs at it and gets it off the low part of the bat. Gurkeerat leaps to his left and it's got his fingertips. Tough chance. Kishan still hasn't nailed one off the middle. Now is the time"
19.2,"Udana to Pollard, 1 run",slower short ball and he pulls straight to deep square. This is Udana's USP at the death. Really digs the cutters in. Pollard can't get it away
19.1,"Udana to Ishan, 1 run","they might have Kishan at the non-striker's end. Udana really gpotaway with this ball. Overpitched on middle, square leg was in, but Kishan finds him with the slog. Runs through and dives at the other end and he's made it"
18.6,"Saini to Ishan, 1 run","slower ball, dug in short at leg stump. Miscued pull out to deep square leg"
18.5,"Saini to Ishan, SIX runs","clears Kohli at long-off! Another mis-hit turns into six for Mumbai. This is a knee height full toss wide outside off. He wants to hit over the leg side but the angle is against him. It ends up a slice, and that is enough after keeping Kohli interested for a moment"
18.4,"Saini to Pollard, 1 run",straight long-off saves them three. That is a position people have for Pollard. This is a low full toss outside off and he sends it whistling past the bowler
18.3,"Saini to Ishan, 1 run","good enough. 143kph, full and at off stump. Kishan is too late on the slog. Perhaps his hands slipped off too. He calls for new gloves immediately"
18.2,"Saini to Pollard, 1 run","outside edge but gathered on the bounce by Chahal at third man. Short and wide from Saini, missed out on the big cut and third man is fine"
18.1,"Saini to Ishan, 1 run","full slower ball just outside off, mistimed slog along the floor to deep midwicket"
18.1,"Saini to Ishan, 1 wide",short and down leg side. Kishan has a whip at it and is beaten but he gets a run
17.6,"Chahal to Pollard, SIX runs","forehand slap flat and over the bowler! 20-ball fifty, get outta here you beast! Talk about clutch player. He is doing EVERYTHING he is paid to do. Dropped short at a middle stump line, backs into the leg side and flat-bats this over Chahal like he's facing tennis serves from the Under-14s"
17.5,"Chahal to Ishan, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punched to long-off's left off the back foot"
17.4,"Chahal to Ishan, SIX runs","carts him over deep midwicket! He does stick with the loopy stuff. But Kishan has figured that out now. Kohli asking Chahal why he isn't making him into the off side. Good length at off, gets low and slogs it. Just about clears the fielder"
17.3,"Chahal to Pollard, 1 run",good length and pushed flat down leg side. No room this time. Whipped to deep midwicket off the back foot
17.2,"Chahal to Pollard, 2 runs",full and following him down leg side. Miscued slog bounces out to deep midwicket's right
17.1,"Chahal to Pollard, SIX runs","drilled over long-off! Good length ball, legbreak at off stump. Backs into the leg side, has the reach and the room to absolutely nail this. 81 metres"
16.6,"Zampa to Pollard, 3 runs","dropped at backward point! Chahal running backwards barely gets a finger on that. And they're back for the third which means Pollard keeps strike. Zampa slows it down, goes good length legbreak outside off. Pollard looks for the slog again and the leading edge floats over Chahal's head and his lunge to the right won't get him to it"
16.5,"Zampa to Pollard, SIX runs","miscued! But still a long long way! Wow, what power! Googly, flat and at a good length wide outside off again. Drags it off the inside half of the bat and then what? It's still in the upper tiers at midwicket"
16.4,"Zampa to Pollard, 2 runs","tossed up full outside off, driven firmly to extra cover's right. Easy second for them"
16.3,"Zampa to Pollard, SIX runs","oh this is gone far! Dropped short and just outside off, gets back in the crease and effortlessly deposits this pull into the upper tiers at midwicket"
16.2,"Zampa to Pollard, SIX runs","Negi drops it at deep extra! His night has turned! Full ball wide outside off, slices it. He goes reverse cup as this is about head height. And he tips it behind"
16.1,"Zampa to Pollard, FOUR runs","doesn't move. Googly, tossed up wide outside off. Reaches out and drills it past Zampa's face. Long-off's has no chance"
15.6,"Saini to Pollard, 1 run","short outside off, pulled along the ground to deep midwicket"
15.5,"Saini to Ishan, 1 run","overpitched outside off, clubbed down to long-on"
15.4,"Saini to Ishan, 2 runs","yorker outside off, chopped to point's right. Dube puts in a dive there and manages to parry it towards third man who was running the other way trying to cover him. They take the extra run"
15.3,"Saini to Ishan, no run","can't get the scoop away. Slower ball at a good length, wide outside off. Dances into the off side and looks to force it fine. Cops it on the body"
15.2,"Saini to Ishan, 2 runs","off the toe-end and that probably costs two runs. Low full toss at off stump, lofts it over the bowler. Mid-off was in. But long-on cleans up"
15.1,"Saini to Ishan, FOUR runs",smart. Kishan is in his element and playing the bowlers now. This is a full ball pushed across his corridor and he squats and opens the face to slice this to the third man boundary
14.6,"Chahal to Pollard, FOUR runs",dropped short of long-off and sneaks through from under him. Short of a good length and wide outside off - a ball bowled expecting the batsman to step out. Pollard merely stays in the crease and uses this reach to flay this. Padikkal dives forward and to his left but there's too much to do as it dips on him
14.5,"Chahal to Ishan, 1 run",good length and more at middle stump this time. Still not giving him pace. Steps out and punches to long-on
14.4,"Chahal to Ishan, SIX runs",pulls over square leg. He waits in the crease this time and Chahal's slow loopy leg side bowling serves well from there. Deep in the crease for the pull
14.3,"Chahal to Ishan, 2 runs","just clears short fine and deep square rushes to his left to put in a slide. Bit lazy from Dube at short fine, who sort of just watched it go without starting a sprint back. Udana does well to pull it back with a backhand flick. It was an attempted sweep"
14.2,"Chahal to Ishan, no run","oh lovely bowling. Good length, tossed up slowly down leg side where Kishan has jumped. Forced to push it back down"
14.1,"Chahal to Pollard, 1 run",he backs into the leg side and Chahal slides it at a length just inside the wide line. Can only get it down to long-off off the toe-end
13.6,"Zampa to Ishan, SIX runs","swung over midwicket! That is fifty for Kishan on his comeback. Not been completely at his best, but he's in there with a gauge on the conditions. This is full outside off and now he knows that's going to be the line. Steps across and nails the slog"
13.5,"Zampa to Pollard, 1 run",short and at leg stump. Flicked to deep midwicket's right
13.4,"Zampa to Pollard, no run","good length and fired down leg side. Didn't look to me like Pollard got anything on that, but there's no wide call so there must have been pad"
13.3,"Zampa to Ishan, 1 run",full and wide outside off again. Shuffles and drills to long-off
13.2,"Zampa to Ishan, no run",yorker length and wide outside off. Pushing it away and away from Kishan's favoured sweep shot. World-class from Zampa. He chops at this one and is beaten
13.1,"Zampa to Pollard, 1 run",good length and sliding onto leg stump. Flicked to deep square
12.6,"Udana to Pollard, 1 run","good length at off stump, shuffles and flicks straight to square leg"
12.5,"Udana to Ishan, 1 run",nicely done. Floaty slower ball lands in the blockhole. Can't get the drive away. Trickles out to long-off
12.4,"Udana to Ishan, no run","offcutter, floated at a full length outside off. Driven straight to extra cover"
12.3,"Udana to Pollard, 1 run","good length and just outside off, cut away from him. Patted to backward point"
12.2,"Udana to Pollard, no run",oh gets away with that. Slower ball dropped short at the hips. Pulled straight to short fine
12.2,"Udana to Pollard, 1 wide","slower short ball again, too wide outside off again"
12.2,"Udana to Pollard, 1 wide","slower ball, short and very wide. Left alone"
12.1,"Udana to Ishan, 1 run","back-of-the-hand cutter to start off, good length outside off. Swept firmly to long-on"
11.6,"Zampa to Ishan, 1 run","short at middle stump, pulled to deep square"
11.5,"Zampa to Ishan, 2 runs","full and wide outside off, pummeled off the front foot to long-off's left. Padikkal sprints across and taps it back in for long-on who was converging. Full stretch"
11.4,"Zampa to Pollard, 1 run","low full toss at leg stump, whipped out to deep midwicket"
11.3,"Zampa to Ishan, 1 run","full googly outside off, swept along the turf to long-on"
11.2,"Zampa to Pandya, OUT","it's high but not far enough! Zampa gets the big one. Good length on leg stump, the trademark leg-side slog from Hardik, with hardly a stride. He's not close to the pitch of that one and ends up scooping high. Taken at the line by Negi"
11.1,"Zampa to Ishan, 1 run","googly, full outside off. Lofted drive to long-off's left"
10.6,"Saini to Pandya, no run","pristine drive, but straight to mid-off. Good length ball outside off"
10.5,"Saini to Ishan, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut aerially to sweeper's right"
10.4,"Saini to Ishan, no run","slower short ball outside off, mistimed cut to extra cover"
10.4,"Saini to Ishan, 1 wide","short and down leg side, too quick for him to connect on the pull"
10.3,"Saini to Ishan, SIX runs","oh that is massive. Whew! Good length ball at middle stump, a step back into the crease and a proper connection on a proper slog. Way way over midwicket"
10.2,"Saini to Ishan, no run","short of a good length, cramps him at middle stump. Can only tap this back towards the bowler"
10.1,"Saini to Ishan, SIX runs","pumped over his head first ball. Sweet hit. The pace on the ball helps. Full ball just outside off, half stride and good swing"
9.6,"Sundar to Ishan, 1 run","good length at middle stump, shuffles and shovels into the vacant midwicket region"
9.5,"Sundar to Pandya, 1 run","good length outside off, a late cut straight to short third man"
9.4,"Sundar to Ishan, 1 run",good length and in the corridor. Uses the angle to whip to long-on's left
9.3,"Sundar to Pandya, 1 run","good length at off, shuffles and punches to long-on"
9.2,"Sundar to Pandya, no run","check-drive back down the pitch. Good length ball outside off, grips and rises a touch as he shapes to flick"
9.1,"Sundar to Ishan, 1 run","good length and into the pads, flicked to deep midwicket off the back foot"
8.6,"Chahal to Ishan, 1 run",tempting and teasing. This is so much fun to watch. 79kph and dipping on a good length. Steps out and drives to long-on
8.5,"Chahal to Pandya, 1 run",good length and flat onto the pads. Flicked to deep midwicket
8.4,"Chahal to Ishan, 1 run","good length on middle stump, steps out and is beaten in flight. Luckily for him this is the stock legbreak turning into him. Punches to long-on"
8.3,"Chahal to Pandya, 1 run","good length and just outside off, flatter this time at 82kph. Punched to long-off"
8.2,"Chahal to Ishan, 1 run","and just as I say that, he goes 73.5kph with this good length ball. Tempting Kishan to go aerial and clear the big leg side. He sweeps safely out to deep midwicket"
8.1,"Chahal to Pandya, 1 run","full on off stump, gets forward and drives with the turn to long-off's left"
7.6,"Zampa to Pandya, 1 run","googly, short of a good length on leg stump. Pushed out to long-on off the back foot"
7.5,"Zampa to Pandya, SIX runs","see ya! Bit of a helicopter shot this. Full toss pushed through at leg stump. Doesn't even swing at that really, it's just a flick. And yet it's gone 94 metres, in the midwicket region"
7.4,"Zampa to Ishan, 1 run","good length, spinning into leg stump at 94kph. Flicked to deep midwicket off the front foot"
7.3,"Zampa to Pandya, 1 run","googly tossed up outside off, driven firmly to long-off"
7.2,"Zampa to Ishan, 1 run","full and wide outside off, looks for the sweep and gets it off the thick inside edge to deep midwicket's left"
7.1,"Zampa to Pandya, 1 run","good length slider on leg stump, hurriedly pushed into the vacant midwicket region"
6.6,"Chahal to Pandya, 1 run","good length and pushed through at middle stump, driven down to long-on"
6.5,"Chahal to Ishan, 1 run",mistimed slog as he tosses one up at middle stumps. Steps out and miscues it to long-on's left
6.4,"Chahal to de Kock, OUT","taken at deep midwicket! This is such smart bowling from Chahal. Always seems to know exactly what to do when he's in RCB colours. Lobs this one up at 74kph, looping at a good length on leg stump. Tempts QDK into the slog sweep but with long boundaries and almost nothing in the air, that is a hard shot to play. Not to mention the overspin. Taken well inside the boundary"
6.3,"Chahal to de Kock, 2 runs",good length and turning into the pads. 71.8kph. Slowwww. Dabbed to deep square's right off the back foot
6.2,"Chahal to Ishan, 1 run","tossed right up at 79.8kph again, middle stump line. Driven to long-on"
6.1,"Chahal to de Kock, 1 run","tossed up at middle stump, thumped down to long-on off the front foot"
5.6,"Sundar to de Kock, 1 run",short and into leg stump. Mistimed pull out to deep square
5.5,"Sundar to de Kock, no run","good length and sliding right onto his pad, down leg side. Was looking to whip into the leg side"
5.4,"Sundar to Ishan, 1 run","full on off stump, driven firmly off the front foot to long-off"
5.3,"Sundar to de Kock, 1 run","good length, cramped at the stumps. Tapped to long-off off the back foot"
5.2,"Sundar to de Kock, no run",inside edge again. Good length and sliding onto the stumps. QDK looking to make room for the punch into the off side
5.1,"Sundar to Ishan, 1 run","good length and just outside off, dropped into the covers with soft hands, off the front foot"
4.6,"Saini to Ishan, 1 run","good length and just outside off, nicely forward to defend to mid-off's left"
4.5,"Saini to Ishan, no run","yorker at leg stump, jammed out to midwicket. 143.9kph"
4.4,"Saini to Ishan, no run","full on leg stump, flicked straight to mid-on"
4.3,"Saini to Ishan, no run","good length at leg stump line. 143.9kph, cops that on the thigh as he looks to flick"
4.2,"Saini to Ishan, SIX runs",pulled over fine leg. He's good at this shot. Short and just above the hip and he's under it quickly and this is quickly over the rope off the bat. Ball's lost somewhere in the stands
4.1,"Saini to Ishan, no run","full and just outside off, 140.5kph. Driven firmly to mid-on"
3.6,"Sundar to de Kock, no run",nearly gets middle stump. Good length ball slides in as he backs away to try and cut. Inside edge to short fine
3.5,"Sundar to de Kock, no run","short and just outside off, cut to short third off the under-edge"
3.4,"Sundar to Ishan, 1 run",good length and cramping him at a middle stump line. Hurriedly nudged to mid-on off the back foot
3.3,"Sundar to Ishan, no run","good length at middle, defended off the front foot"
3.2,"Sundar to Ishan, no run","length and at the stumps, defended off the back foot"
3.1,"Sundar to Ishan, no run","good length and sliding onto the pad, tapped to midwicket"
2.6,"Udana to de Kock, 2 runs","full slower ball outside off, driven along the floor to sweeper"
2.5,"Udana to de Kock, no run","slower ball, short of a good length in the corridor. Beaten on the cut"
2.4,"Udana to Ishan, 1 run","good length and just outside off, runs it down to third man"
2.3,"Udana to Ishan, FOUR runs",whistles past point. Confident comeback into the IPL for Kishan. Too short and too wide from Udana this one
2.2,"Udana to Yadav, OUT","taken to his right by AB! 130kph, good length ball just outside off. Lands on the seam and gets big on him. Once again an angled bat from SKY and he can't control this attempted back foot tap into the off side. Thick edge taken easily and that must be the first non-Malinga Sri Lankan IPL wicket in ages"
2.1,"Udana to Yadav, no run",good length and raps him on the pad as he looks to chop this into the off side
1.6,"Sundar to de Kock, 2 runs","good length outside off, big stride out as he drives this between cover and extra cover"
1.5,"Sundar to de Kock, no run","good length at middle stump, defended down the pitch"
1.4,"Sundar to Rohit Sharma, OUT","taken at deep midwicket! That hard length just behind good length again, and at a middle and off line. Not too much room for the pull but Rohit gets a decent connection on it anyway. Expect this is all height. The fielder takes it a comfortable distance inside the boundary"
1.3,"Sundar to Rohit Sharma, no run","just short of a good length, cramping him outside off. Punched to extra cover"
1.2,"Sundar to Rohit Sharma, no run","good length, at an off stump line. Tapped back towards the bowler off the back foot"
1.1,"Sundar to Rohit Sharma, no run",good length and spun into the pad. Flicked to midwicket off the back foot
0.6,"Udana to de Kock, FOUR runs",just over cover! Full curving outswinger outside off. QDK doesn't lean into this drive. Slices at it and it's just past the fielder's lunge
0.5,"Udana to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","good length and into the pads, 128kph, flicked to deep square"
0.4,"Udana to Rohit Sharma, no run","good length and wide outside off, 131.2kph, looks to drive through the covers but through it early. Back down the pitch off the under-edge"
0.3,"Udana to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs",lifted over fine leg. Short and gently up at a leg stump line. Just uses the angle and picks it up over short fine
0.2,"Udana to de Kock, 1 run","short of a good length, 124.7kph, just outside off. On his toes to punch this to third man's left"
0.2,"Udana to de Kock, 1 wide","good length and very wide outside off, left alone. Bit of movement away"
0.1,"Udana to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",good length and curved in at off stump. Flicked to deep square
19.6,"Pattinson to Dubey, SIX runs","pumped over his head for 200! Slower short ball again and how many times have seen already in this edition, the batsmen expecting those lengths? Dube does it again and he holds a strong base to slap this straight"
19.5,"Pattinson to AB, 1 run",slower short ball in the corridor. Shapes to pull but that dies on him and he has to arch back and guide this to short third
19.4,"Pattinson to Dubey, 1 run","slow and short outside off, pulled off the toe-end to deep midwicket"
19.3,"Pattinson to Dubey, SIX runs",whipped over square leg! These are poor lengths from Mumbai Indians over the last ten minutes. Good length and into the pads. Enough pace for Dube to wait and simply flick his wrists for the angle
19.2,"Pattinson to Dubey, SIX runs","down on his knee and crunched over wide long-off! Full slower ball with a lot of room outside off. Waits on the slower one as he drops to his left knee, and clubs from under it"
19.1,"Pattinson to Dubey, no run","slower short ball outside off, has a huge swing at that and is beaten. You could hear the swish of the air as he went after that"
18.6,"Bumrah to AB, SIX runs",whooped into the second tier! What a connection. And yet another fifty for AB! Dropped short at a middle stump line. AB sets up with the front leg compressed and heaves from under this. It goes so high and about 90 metres back in the square leg direction. Bang off the middle of the bat
18.5,"Bumrah to Dubey, 1 run","slower short ball at the body, mistimed pull down to long-on"
18.4,"Bumrah to Dubey, FOUR runs","clever. Slightly baffling tactics here. Third man is in and he goes short and across off stump. Dube just hangs back, uses the angle, and opens the face to bisect keeper and short third"
18.3,"Bumrah to AB, 1 run",short and into the pads. Hits the pull straight to short fine. Disappointed with himself for missing out
18.2,"Bumrah to AB, FOUR runs","carved over his head. Bumrah misses on the yorker again. It's a low full toss just outside off. AB is crouching in wait and when it shows up in his arc, just swishes from inside the line. That was all about timing and placement"
18.1,"Bumrah to Dubey, 1 run",short and into the pitch at leg stump. Awkwardly pushed into midwicket off the back foot
17.6,"Boult to AB, SIX runs",drags it wayyyyyyyyy over fine leg! Too predictable from Boult. Yet another slower short ball. AB waits deep in the crease this time and is almost waiting for the hoick over square. It all works out perfectly and a good over ends with a six after all
17.5,"Boult to Dubey, 1 run","slower short ball outside off again, can't find power on the pull shot. Pollard swoops on it to his left at long-on and keeps them to one"
17.4,"Boult to AB, 1 leg bye","struck on the helmet. Slower short ball, loses his timing as he looks to play the hook. Pinged on the side of the head. On his feet and running"
17.3,"Boult to Dubey, 1 run","low full toss on the pads, flicked straight to short fine"
17.2,"Boult to AB, 1 run","slower short ball at leg stump, checks the pull, taps it down to short fine"
17.1,"Boult to Padikkal, OUT","can't clear Pollard. Slower short ball outside off, sits up for the pull and he pulls to try and clear the wide long-on boundary. Pollard skips and strides to his left, keeps the eyes on the ball and stretches up to take it"
16.6,"Bumrah to AB, SIX runs","oh beautiful! That is a golf swing. Overpitched on off stump from Bumrah and that is asking for trouble. Such a gorgeous, balanced swing to hit it over the bowler. Competely still apart from the bat swing. Just gorgeous"
16.5,"Bumrah to Padikkal, 1 leg bye",backs into the leg side and cops this good length ball on his back knee. That'll sting. They'll sneak the leg bye
16.4,"Bumrah to AB, 1 leg bye",good length and raps him on the legs as he stays deep in the crease and looks for the glance. Deflected into the off side
16.3,"Bumrah to AB, SIX runs","whack! Over the wide long-on boundary with a back foot shot. Difficult, but not for this man. Slower ball dropped short, just outside off. Sits up and this is flat and over the boundary"
16.2,"Bumrah to AB, no run",short and wide outside off. Slashes and is beaten on the upper cut
16.1,"Bumrah to AB, FOUR runs","drilled over extra cover. Waited, deep in the crease. It was full and wide and he just needed half a stride to get the weight forward and use the room to find that boundary"
15.6,"Pollard to AB, 1 run","good length and a slower ball outside off, punched on the up to long-off's left"
15.5,"Pollard to AB, 2 runs","slower short ball at off stump, controlled pull to deep square's left"
15.4,"Pollard to AB, FOUR runs","full and onto the pads, waits on that and sweeps it to the vacant long leg boundary"
15.3,"Pollard to Padikkal, 1 run","good length outside off, pushed into the off side with soft hands"
15.2,"Pollard to Padikkal, FOUR runs","chopped to the point boundary for his second fifty of the season. Short ball outside off, waits on it, makes room and makes sure to get it well behind square"
15.1,"Pollard to AB, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked to deep square off the front foot"
14.6,"Krunal to AB, 1 run","good length on middle stump, deep in the crease to punch this to long-off"
14.5,"Krunal to Padikkal, 1 run","checks his sweep as Krunal slows it down. Good length ball at middle, was down for it too early. Awkwardly pats it into the leg side"
14.4,"Krunal to Padikkal, FOUR runs","finds the extra cover boundary with a loft. Anticipates Pandya's quick, full ball across him from around. He's adapted. And he's kept the front leg away to make room and opened the wrists to find the spot he wants"
14.3,"Krunal to AB, 1 run","good length on off stump, driven to long-off with the turn"
14.2,"Krunal to AB, FOUR runs",whipped nonchalantly to the midwicket boundary. Good length and skidding into his legs. Stays deep in the crease and this flies off the bat as he punches it to long-on's right
14.1,"Krunal to AB, 2 runs","full and drifted in at off stump, gets forward and slices it to sweeper's left"
13.6,"Pattinson to Padikkal, no run","slower good length ball outside off, looks to chop behind point and gets an inside edge to the keeper"
13.5,"Pattinson to Padikkal, SIX runs","drags it over the long-on boundary this time! Full and in the corridor. He stays leg side of it with the front leg out of the way, but he has a good reach. And a good swing. Dominant batting"
13.4,"Pattinson to Padikkal, SIX runs","slaps it over mid-off! Slower length balls outside off, waits on it this time and nails the connection. First boundary since 8.4"
13.3,"Pattinson to Padikkal, no run","nicely bowled. Slower short ball outside off, shapes to pull and is through it very early to be beaten"
13.2,"Pattinson to AB, 1 run","good length and just outside off, flowing drive on the rise to sweeper's right"
13.1,"Pattinson to Padikkal, 1 run","short at leg stump, whipped to fine leg"
12.6,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 run","googly, good length at middle stump. Watchfully pushed into the covers with an open face"
12.5,"Chahar to AB, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked into the leg side"
12.4,"Chahar to AB, 2 runs","dropped short outside off, steered to sweeper's left"
12.3,"Chahar to AB, no run",beaten outside off. Good length and slows it right down outside off. Half-hearted push on the front foot from AB
12.2,"Chahar to Kohli, OUT","chips it straight to extra cover. Good length and just outside off. Only half a stride from Kohli and a feeble push away from is body as this turns and stays a little steep. Loose shot at best, looked completely out of sorts against Chahar today. Easy take for Rohit"
12.1,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven to long-on"
11.6,"Bumrah to Kohli, no run","short and just outside off, punched straight to backward point off the back foot"
11.5,"Bumrah to Kohli, no run","good length and just outside off, shuffles and defends down the pitch"
11.4,"Bumrah to Padikkal, 1 run","low full toss on leg stump, hurriedly flicked to midwicket's right. A dive from Rohit there but he only parries it away"
11.3,"Bumrah to Kohli, 1 run","good length and in at middle stump, uses the angle to turn it to fine leg"
11.2,"Bumrah to Kohli, no run",inside edge onto boot as he looks to push this through the covers. Good length and just outside off and he was on the front foot
11.1,"Bumrah to Padikkal, 1 run","offcutter, short at middle stump. On is toes and closes the face to tuck this to deep square"
10.6,"Chahar to Kohli, no run","good length outside off, defended into the off side"
10.5,"Chahar to Kohli, no run","squared him up and the leading edge falls short of extra cover. Once again, looks like Kohli expected this length ball to slide into him. Holds its line as he closes the face"
10.4,"Chahar to Kohli, no run","length outside off, defended uppishly to extra cover"
10.3,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 run",lbw appeal as he looks for the reverse sweep and fluffs it. Caught on the back leg. A good length ball turning into the corridor
10.2,"Chahar to Kohli, 1 run",thick outside edge to third man. Kohli was looking to pick this good length ball off the pitch. He was back for the one that comes in
10.1,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 run","googly, tossed up at off stump, driven to long-off"
9.6,"Krunal to Kohli, no run","good length at middle, punched to long-on off the back foot"
9.5,"Krunal to Padikkal, 1 run",oh hello Kedar Krunal Malinga. Goes low and very very side arm. Good length and skidding onto the pads. Flicked out to deep square
9.5,"Krunal to Padikkal, 1 wide","good length and wide outside off, left alone"
9.4,"Krunal to Padikkal, no run",nails the yorker length outside off and Padikkal lets it go. Was caught off guard there
9.3,"Krunal to Kohli, 1 run","full on leg stump, driven to long-on"
9.2,"Krunal to Padikkal, 1 run","low full toss at middle stump, driven to deep midwicket"
9.1,"Krunal to Padikkal, no run","cops it on the back leg. Good length ball at middle stump, loses shape on the attempted slog sweep"
8.6,"Boult to Finch, OUT",lobbed straight to long-off. Full slower ball wide outside off. He's sitting on the back foot trying to go over extra cover. But the pace throws that off and it's taken well inside the rope
8.5,"Boult to Padikkal, 1 run",falls short of fine leg. The short ball plan nearly works out. Up at his grille and he loses shape - and his bottom hand - as he leaps and has a flap at it
8.4,"Boult to Padikkal, FOUR runs","dropped short and down leg side, swivels to free up some room and drags this pull very fine"
8.3,"Boult to Padikkal, no run",bouncer at a middle stump line. Ducks to let that go
8.2,"Boult to Finch, 1 run","short of a good length outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
8.1,"Boult to Padikkal, 1 run","good length at leg stump, whipped to fine leg off the back foot"
7.6,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
7.6,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 wide","googly, short and very wide outside off. Left alone"
7.5,"Chahar to Finch, 1 run",short outside off with a diagonal run up. Backs away and slaps it to long-off
7.4,"Chahar to Finch, no run","good length at off stump, patted back down the pitch"
7.3,"Chahar to Finch, FOUR runs",finds the backward square boundary yet again and that is fifty for Finch. Finally gets into gear for RCB. This was dropped short and he was down on one knee to whip it past short fine
7.2,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 run",good length and into the corridor. Chopped to sweeper cover
7.1,"Chahar to Finch, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
6.6,"Krunal to Padikkal, no run",beaten. Quicker full ball outside off and Padikkal was caught on the back foot trying to have a slash at this
6.5,"Krunal to Finch, 1 run","good length at leg stump, flicked to short fine's left"
6.4,"Krunal to Finch, FOUR runs","lofted to the extra cover boundary. Full and at off stump, clears the front leg and gets a clean swing inside-out"
6.3,"Krunal to Finch, no run","good length outside off, chopped to extra cover"
6.2,"Krunal to Finch, no run","beaten. Arm  ball in the corridor, was looking for the cut"
6.1,"Krunal to Padikkal, 1 run","full on off stump, driven along the floor to long-off"
5.6,"Bumrah to Finch, no run",short and into the body. Looks to tuck into the leg side with soft hands for the single. Bumrah gets to it quickly
5.6,"Bumrah to Finch, 1 wide","good length and down leg side, left alone"
5.5,"Bumrah to Finch, no run","good length and in at off stump. Nails the timing on this drive on the rise, on the bounce to extra cover"
5.4,"Bumrah to Padikkal, 1 run","slower ball, good length and at middle stump. Smothers it and drops this pitch side into the off side with soft hands"
5.3,"Bumrah to Padikkal, FOUR runs",sweet connection on the pull. Short ball up at the ribs. Took his eye off that but went though with the pull. No reason to try and keep it on the ground because square leg was in
5.2,"Bumrah to Padikkal, 4 leg byes",past the keeper off the thigh guard. Short ball getting big on him and he looked to fend that fine
5.1,"Bumrah to Padikkal, no run","good length at off stump, defended into the off side off the back foot"
4.6,"Chahar to Finch, no run","now Chahar with his go-to mind-game. Goes from between the umpire and the stumps. Good length and at off stump. Well forward to block, is Finch"
4.5,"Chahar to Finch, FOUR runs","now through the covers! Dropped short once more, at a middle stump line. Finch winning the mind games. Backs away and lashes at it with a flat bat"
4.4,"Chahar to Finch, FOUR runs",gets in his head again and drags this over short fine this time. Backs into the leg side and then returns to his stance. Chahar bowls short at leg stump again. Finch gets low and turns it over the infield
4.3,"Chahar to Finch, FOUR runs",follows him down leg but drops it short. Finch opens up the body and pulls it over the square leg fielder
4.2,"Chahar to Padikkal, 1 run","good length and a legbreak, at leg stump, flicked to square leg's right"
4.1,"Chahar to Finch, 1 run","good length and sliding on at middle, onto the back foot and flicks to deep midwicket"
3.6,"Pattinson to Padikkal, no run","good length and just outside off, 141kph, defended onto the pads off the inside edge"
3.5,"Pattinson to Finch, 3 runs",just clears mid-off who sprints backwards and whips the ball in as he tumbles over the boundary. Chahar is the man. Short ball just outside off and climbing up. He lofts it with an angled bat
3.4,"Pattinson to Finch, no run","full slower ball at off stump, jammed out to extra cover"
3.3,"Pattinson to Finch, no run","good length slower ball on the pads, looks to flick but that deflects to the keeper off his leg"
3.2,"Pattinson to Finch, FOUR runs","pulls in front of square. Short ball at middle stump, backs into the leg side and pulls cleanly this time. Also aerially, but well to the fielder's left"
3.1,"Pattinson to Finch, 2 runs","just clears mid-on. Short and wide, looks to cut him over the infield but is through it too soon. Bat turns in the hands"
2.6,"Boult to Finch, 1 run","short outside off, cut to sweeper point"
2.5,"Boult to Finch, 2 runs","short and just outside off, lashed to sweeper point's right"
2.4,"Boult to Finch, SIX runs","sweeeet. Full ball at the stumps, keeps the front leg well out of the way, offers the full face and lofts this straight over the bowler. He's been waiting for that length all tournament"
2.3,"Boult to Finch, no run",dropped at short midwicket. Big dive to the left from Rohit. Managed to get two hands on it too but couldn't keep it in the grasp as he went to floor. Short ball was pulled firmly and low to his left
2.2,"Boult to Finch, no run",beaten. Steps out again to have a whack. This short ball climbs across him
2.1,"Boult to Padikkal, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, opens the face and turns it down to third man"
1.6,"Pattinson to Finch, 2 runs","just short of the incoming deep square fielder. Short of a good length in the corridor, hurried onto him as he shaped to pull. He got too far underneath it to keep his shape and just lobbed it up. Krunal ran in a long way before putting in the dive to his left"
1.5,"Pattinson to Finch, FOUR runs","outside edge over slip. Offcutter, just short of a good length. Finch had made the decision to step out and he did, and thew the bat at this"
1.4,"Pattinson to Finch, no run","short of a good length, up at the hips on an off stump line, can't do more than defend that into the covers"
1.3,"Pattinson to Finch, no run",good length and honing in for off stump. Tentative push out from the crease
1.2,"Pattinson to Finch, no run",a groan and down he goes! A short of a good length ball jumping in viciously from outside off. Hangs the bat out and gets an inside that deflects the ball straight into the box
1.1,"Pattinson to Finch, 2 runs","short of a good length on leg stump, whipped out to deep square"
0.6,"Boult to Finch, 1 run","good length and floated in, driven on the rise to mid-off"
0.5,"Boult to Finch, no run",appeal for lbw but there might have been an inside edge on that and he might have been outside off when he was struck. Good length ball hooping in from outside off and he got locked on the front foot. Ah in fact that was rising over the stumps
0.4,"Boult to Padikkal, 1 run",short and at the hips. Onto his toes to nudge this to short fine's right
0.3,"Boult to Padikkal, no run","full and in at middle stump, flicked straight to short fine"
0.2,"Boult to Padikkal, FOUR runs",neatly done. Full and at leg stump. Was looking to shape it away. That helped Padikkal as he waited on it and closed the face to send this through square leg
0.1,"Boult to Padikkal, 2 runs","just evades the diving cover fielder! Full outswinger outside off, drives with hard hands and a tad early"
19.3,"Ashwin to Tom Curran, FOUR runs","and Curran uses all the experience. Makes room, goes with the turn, clears cover. Four. It is all over. The highest IPL run chase is up, and despite an innings that made you want to call the guy back. What a story this game is. Don't tell me to not get carried away"
19.2,"Ashwin to Parag, OUT",oh he sweeps. Ashwin slips in the googly after showing him the gap square on the leg side. Had to take the risk. Parag bit the bait. Bowled neck and crop
19.1,"Ashwin to Parag, no run","full, dipping, dug out"
18.6,"Shami to Tewatia, OUT","oh man, the greatest 40 minutes of commentary have come to an end. Tewatia has found deep midwicket with the pull, but he has made sure they win the match. Fifty-three off 31 after everybody wanted him thrown into the Gulf. Take a bloody bow, sir. You are a beautiful beautiful player. Storytellers kill for guys like you"
18.5,"Shami to Tewatia, SIX runs","oh he has reached fifty. Minutes ago, they were all asking for a compassion dismissal for him. This, right here, is the importance of keeping on fighting. Keep kicking. Short ball, outside off, and he has upper-cut it for a six. Well played, RT"
18.4,"Shami to Archer, 1 run","goes for the yorker, dug out for a single to deep point"
18.3,"Shami to Archer, SIX runs","golf swing. This is a great day at the cricket. Nine off nine now. Amid this euphoria, this is pretty abysmal death bowling, I am sorry. Length ball, in the slot, on pace, and Archer ain't no Uthappa to be chipping it sweetly"
18.2,"Shami to Archer, SIX runs","which is just as well because Archer has hit the first ball for six. Short ball, on pace, and Archer loves him some on-pace short bowling. Over wicket for six"
18.1,"Shami to Uthappa, OUT",what a weak shot from Uthappa. Can you believe he has holed out to long-off at Sharjah to a ball right in his slot? This is just a chip. Need to be going harder at them. That is a poor shot. This ball is right in the sweet slot
17.6,"Cottrell to Tewatia, SIX runs","wow Rahul bloody Tewatia. This is a story for the ages, son. What redemption. Now Uthappa has to give him strike. He has smacked a wide length ball over midwicket for another six. Now only 21 required in two overs"
17.5,"Cottrell to Tewatia, no run","goes for the fifth. Slower length ball wide outside off, and he goes across the lines. Beaten"
17.4,"Cottrell to Tewatia, SIX runs","well, Rahul, what a player. You are a champion. You have fought through the worst of times. Give yourself something to celebrate. Gees across, shuffles early gets a wide low full toss, and sweeps it over midwicket for another flat six"
17.3,"Cottrell to Tewatia, SIX runs","make it three times. Sing your redemption songs. Cottrell pitches up, and he goes over wide long-off. Strike rate of 135 now. Game is on"
17.2,"Cottrell to Tewatia, SIX runs","whoa whoa whoa cricket you beauty. You keep fighting, the tide can turn. He gets a short of a length ball, stands his ground and swings to leg. Not off the absolute middle of the bat but enough to clear the short square boundary and onto the road"
17.1,"Cottrell to Tewatia, SIX runs","it is a small six but it is a six nonetheless. Hang in there, Rahul. Keep swinging. Cottrell follows him with a bouncer, but he manages to get inside the line to pull him flat over long leg"
16.6,"Shami to Uthappa, FOUR runs",mid-off is up and Uthappa goes over the man to get four more as Shami pitches on a length
16.5,"Shami to Uthappa, FOUR runs","gets inside the line of a full toss, flicks it fine, Ashwin makes a dive at fine leg, and gets a bad bounce to allow the boundary"
16.4,"Shami to Tewatia, 1 run","bouncer, toe-ended to extra cover. Still not getting caught"
16.3,"Shami to Tewatia, 2 runs","slogged across the line, no timing, gets just the couple"
16.2,"Shami to Uthappa, 1 run","full and straight, looks for a couple with soft hands, but deep midwicket is alert to it"
16.1,"Shami to Samson, OUT","oh heartbreaking. Samson has perished. Shami is having a great IPL. Bouncer, not a slower ball, so Samson's idea is good to go for the ramp. But he gets extra bounce, and hits the glove before hitting the bat. And then the toe end of the bat, and then Rahul takes the catch"
15.6,"Maxwell to Samson, 1 run",drilled down the ground for a single to long-off. A good result if it is not a six. At least he has the strike
15.5,"Maxwell to Samson, SIX runs","his batting is communicating to KXIP all right. Maxwell gets into the slot again, and he smashes it over midwicket for six more. That's 20 for the over"
15.4,"Maxwell to Samson, 2 runs","Maxwell goes back of a length, worked behind square for a couple"
15.3,"Maxwell to Samson, no run","and now Samson has refused the single. That will make it more awful for Tewatia, but I think he wants to take the toll of Maxwell"
15.2,"Maxwell to Samson, SIX runs",make it two. Maxwell is in the slot. There is life in this chase yet. Another effortless swing. Hardly any anger. All timing. On top of the grandstand behind deep midwicket
15.1,"Maxwell to Samson, SIX runs","cool cat Samson. Lovely effortless six. Flat length ball, and he goes over extra with nonchalance"
14.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Tewatia, no run",oh why the reverse just after hitting one down the ground? Beaten again
14.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Tewatia, SIX runs","relief. Sweet relief. But he needs more to feel better. Jumps at him, goes down the ground, and gets a straight six"
14.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Tewatia, no run","looks for the slog, gets an outside edge, and doesn't even get the single because short third is charging in"
14.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Tewatia, no run","picks the googly, wants to go over long-off, but is not good enough to make a connection"
14.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, 1 run","flat, into the pads, whipped to deep square for one"
14.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Tewatia, 1 run",and the poor guy is trying everything. Reverse hit goes to extra cover for one
13.6,"Neesham to Tewatia, 1 run","the worst result. he has hit one in air, but there is no power behind it, and long-off is straight enough to keep them to one"
13.5,"Neesham to Samson, 1 run",oh a leading edge on a full toss. Not sure why he didn't try to smack this. Anyway it falls short of the charging deep cover. He takes just the single despite the misfield. Seems to have switched off a little
13.4,"Neesham to Tewatia, 1 run","slower ball, really full, drilled to long-on for one"
13.3,"Neesham to Tewatia, no run","oh the walls seem to be closing in. He tries the sweep off Neesham ans is hit on the pad. Doesn't get out, doesn't get off strike"
13.2,"Neesham to Samson, 1 run","on-pace, and Samson won't be happy that he has taken just the single to deep point"
13.1,"Neesham to Samson, SIX runs","let's not be distracted from a Samson masterclass. Wide length ball, he waits for it, and he has driven it over extra cover for a smooth six"
12.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Tewatia, no run","tries the slog weep this time, and is beaten wide outside off"
12.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Tewatia, no run","picks the googly again, looks to go over long-off, but is beaten again"
12.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Tewatia, 1 wide",another googly but this is too wide outside off
12.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Tewatia, no run","googly first up, and there will be more. He has picked the googly but is beaten by the extra bounce"
12.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, 1 run","tossed up wide, stays away from his hitting zone, Samson hits wide of long-off, but Agarwal makes an excellent save after a fumble. Keeps them down to one"
12.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, no run","tossed up wide outside off, beats his reverse sweep. Samson under pressure to manufacture shots now"
12.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, 2 runs","driven on the up, straight of extra cover, gets two to wide long-off"
11.6,"Maxwell to Tewatia, no run","Tewatia laves his crease, Maxwell shortens his length. Another dot. Two overs without a boundary. Maxwell bowling a great spell"
11.5,"Maxwell to Samson, 1 run","down on his knees to ramp him, gets bat on it, but there isn't enough pace on the ball to get him more than one"
11.4,"Maxwell to Samson, 2 runs","dropped at wide long-off. That Tewatia promotion nearly brings about the Samson wicket as he plays a frustrated shot to a shortish ball that cramps him. Bishnoi, diving to his left at long-off, drops him"
11.3,"Maxwell to Tewatia, 1 run",another sweep but Maxwell is not giving him a length to hit hard. Just the single to deep square
11.2,"Maxwell to Samson, 1 leg bye","spears it into the pads, and is happy to concede a leg-bye"
11.1,"Maxwell to Tewatia, 1 run","length ball, into the pads, swept to deep backward square for one"
10.6,"Neesham to Tewatia, 1 run","full toss, and he has shanked it to deep midwicket for one. Seems like Tewatia's batting prowess has been overestimated by RR here"
10.5,"Neesham to Samson, 1 run","slower short ball, hit in the air towards deep midwicket. Heart-in-mouth stuff. Doesn't carry to the fielder"
10.4,"Neesham to Samson, FOUR runs","did he go on-pace there? At any rate, he has bowled too full, and Samson has drilled him through extra cover for four. First boundary in 10 balls"
10.3,"Neesham to Tewatia, 1 run","slower ball, low full toss, hit straight to long-on for one"
10.2,"Neesham to Tewatia, no run","slower ball, really full, hit hard to the straight extra cover"
10.1,"Neesham to Samson, 1 run",and now he yorks Samson. Just the single
9.6,"Maxwell to Samson, 1 run",mis-hit down to long-on for one as Maxwell doesn't let him get under it. First over without a boundary this innings
9.5,"Maxwell to Tewatia, 1 bye","tries the reverse hit, and there is a sound as the ball passes his bat. Rahul can't catch it, but you can't expect the keeper to take catches when someone is attempting a full-blooded reverse"
9.4,"Maxwell to Tewatia, no run","looks to open the face, doesn't get any room. Another dot"
9.3,"Maxwell to Samson, 1 run","spears this into the pads, flicked to deep midwicket"
9.2,"Maxwell to Tewatia, 1 run","low full toss, driven wide of the flying Maxwell for a single"
9.1,"Maxwell to Tewatia, no run","nicely tossed up, middle and leg, defended back to him"
8.6,"Neesham to Smith, OUT","Smith picked his spots in that previous Neesham over, but it is not so easy when the field is spread out. Neesham keeps bowling wide legcutters to him. He looks to go over the off side but he has to manufacture all the pace. He can't. Caught at deep cover"
8.5,"Neesham to Samson, 1 run","short of a length, slower ball, pushed to deep midwicket for one"
8.4,"Neesham to Smith, 1 run","oh man, this bouncer is so slow it has come back down after reaching twice Smith;s height, all that before crossing the wicket. So he has no choice but to pull it. Brings up the fifty"
8.3,"Neesham to Samson, 1 run","back to slower legcutters, pulled down to long-on for one"
8.2,"Neesham to Samson, FOUR runs","seems like Neesham's first on-pace delivery, and Samson loves it. Unleashes a square-drive on the up, through point and square of deep cover"
8.1,"Neesham to Smith, 1 run","slower legcutter, dropped at his toes for a single"
7.6,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run","back of a length, middle and leg, bunted into the leg side to look for two but Ashwin gives a great chase and keeps them down to one"
7.5,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","short, the ball sits in the surface so Samson has to adjust. He does that and drops it into the covers for one"
7.4,"Ashwin to Samson, SIX runs",okay Pooran can't stop this one. Ashwin gets into the slot. You can't do that to Pooran on this track. He lofts him over long-off for a huge six
7.3,"Ashwin to Samson, 2 runs","sensational fielding. Pooran. That needs to go to ESPN Plays of the Day. Samson has pulled this short-of-a-length delivery that is not there for the pull. Samson skies it but the boundaries are not big enough. Pooran dives full length over the rope, catches it, knows he is over the rope, and finds the time to actually flick it back while in air. All of this without flicking the rope when he jumps, and releasing the ball before he hits ground"
7.2,"Ashwin to Smith, 1 run",chipped back over his head but long-on is very straight
7.1,"Ashwin to Samson, 1 run","flat, short of a length, hit in the air to deep cover for one"
6.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, 2 runs","looks to finish the over with a flat defensive delivery, but Smith gets an outside edge for what seems like a four, but Cottrell puts in a huge dive after giving it chase from short thrid man to keep them down to two"
6.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, no run",just short of that slot. Smith pushes it back to him. Can he flight it into that spot again and again? He might get a wicket
6.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, 1 run","wrong'un, short of a length, whipped to deep square for one"
6.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, 1 run","back to back of a length, punched to extra cover for one"
6.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Smith, SIX runs",and Smith shows he is up for it if the leggie pitches it up in his slot. Especially when the leggie doesn't turn his legbreak. Slogged over wide long-on for six more
6.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, 1 run","Bishnoi is not flighting anything any time soon. Flat outside off, punched to deep cover for one"
5.6,"Neesham to Smith, FOUR runs","another slower ball, wide, and allows Smith to throw his hands at it. He might not have got it off the middle, but has enough bat on it to send it over short third man"
5.5,"Neesham to Smith, FOUR runs","down the wicket to punch this slower shortish ball between cover-point and extra cover. This is the legcutter, but there is no purchase for Neesham"
5.4,"Neesham to Smith, 2 runs","slower again, back of a length, hacked into the ground, gets a couple square of deep midwicket"
5.3,"Neesham to Smith, no run","looks for the ramp, gives away the sign too early, and Neesham bowls really wide to hit his pad"
5.2,"Neesham to Smith, FOUR runs","another slower ball, but smartly played by Smith. He doesn't look to hit a six. Just opens the face and chips him from in front of the stumps and over cover-point. This is a good ball that has been placed for four"
5.1,"Neesham to Smith, no run","Smith lines him up for a slog first ball, but he seems to have bowled a slower ball that has been hit to mid-on"
4.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, no run","back of a length, stays away from the Samson loft down the ground. Draws a dot"
4.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, FOUR runs",backs away to see if he can put Bishnoi off his length. And he pulls even though this is not very short. The mis-hit has enough in it to carry over the leaping midwicket
4.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, no run","quicker, flatter, Samson looks to pull but this is not short enough. Hit on the pad but headed down leg"
4.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, SIX runs","and just as I said it, he bowls in the slot. And he doesn't turn the legbreak either. So Samson lines him up and lofts him back over his head for his 100th IPL six"
4.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, no run","on a length, quick, punched to cover. Not one ball in the slot so far"
4.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, 1 wide",wide down the leg side as he looks to cramp him up
4.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Samson, no run","quick legbreak, Rare. He doesn't bowl it that often. Defended back to him"
3.6,"Shami to Samson, 3 runs","nonchalance. That tells you how good this pitch is. Seems like a lazy flick in the air to a length, but it carries over midwicket. That gets him three"
3.5,"Shami to Smith, 1 run","Smith is looking to ramp this, the ball turns out to be short, he still goes on with the shot, and ends up cue-ending to deep square leg for one"
3.4,"Shami to Smith, no run","slower, short of a length, he looks to shuffle to ff to help this past short fine again, but is hit on the pad"
3.3,"Shami to Smith, FOUR runs","full toss, on the pads, and Smith won't refuse a gift twice in a row. If Shami is going to bowl straight, he needs to send fine leg back"
3.2,"Shami to Smith, no run","slower ball, short, on the stumps, and Smith knows he can send this over short fine for four, but he misses out"
3.1,"Shami to Smith, SIX runs","crisp sound of the bat. Don't worry about that. Slogs it from outside off, over midwicket. Can't be bowling on-pace length to him in this mood"
2.6,"Cottrell to Samson, no run","short of a length, not much room, punched to point from where Pooran lets rip a throw at the non-striker's end. Awfully close to Smith's head, who has to take evasive action"
2.5,"Cottrell to Samson, FOUR runs","shuffles across to line up a length ball, and even though it turns out to be a slower one, he hits through the line and goes back over his head"
2.4,"Cottrell to Samson, no run","slower ball, does him in, beats him outside off as he looks to push at it"
2.3,"Cottrell to Samson, SIX runs","phew. Samson seems like that innings the other day hasn't yet ended. The first legal delivery he faces, and he belts a back-of-a-length ball over long-on for a six. From well outside off"
2.3,"Cottrell to Samson, 1 wide","starts with a wide length ball, and this seams to have gone away off the seam. Called wide"
2.2,"Cottrell to Buttler, OUT","the Cottrell salute comes out. This is a nice shot to a length ball on off, across the line but that is fair game. He has timed it well, but Sarfaraz takes a sharp low catch square leg"
2.1,"Cottrell to Buttler, no run","wide length ball, Buttler makes a good connection, but can't get beat short extra cover"
1.6,"Shami to Smith, no run","this is definitely a slog as Shami pitches on a length again, but he is beaten on the inside edge"
1.5,"Shami to Smith, FOUR runs",shot Smithy. He is playing a different innings to the kinds we are accustomed to seeing. He shuffles across and lofts this full ball back over Shami's head. He is almost slogging them
1.4,"Shami to Buttler, 1 run","into the pads, worked to leg for one"
1.3,"Shami to Buttler, no run","walks down the wicket, they go up for a catch as the ball seams away and beats him. Rahul lets out a celebrappeal, but he is ruled not out, and they don't review. Seems it has gone off Buttler's arm"
1.3,"Shami to Buttler, 1 wide",another bouncer gone too high. Called wide
1.2,"Shami to Buttler, no run","dipping slower yorker, draws an appeal from Shami, but Rahul has collected this well down the leg side so it can't have hit him in front. Just flicks the inside half of the foot"
1.1,"Shami to Buttler, 2 runs","a length ball, into the pads, placed in front of deep square for two"
0.6,"Cottrell to Smith, no run","short of a length, wide, slower, he looks to run it past that wide slip but can't beat him"
0.5,"Cottrell to Smith, FOUR runs","wide length ball, Smith stands tall and punches this on the up. Through extra cover for four more"
0.5,"Cottrell to Smith, 1 wide",another wide down the leg side as Cottrell looks to cramp him up
0.5,"Cottrell to Smith, 1 wide",wide down the leg side
0.4,"Cottrell to Smith, FOUR runs","both his deep fielders are square on the leg side, and he has pierced them. Short of a length, and he has flicked this fine of deep square leg. In the air, mind, so you need precision on that"
0.3,"Cottrell to Smith, no run","oh Smith has wasted this. Wide full ball, but Smith's feet are stuck and he doesn't get close to it, and mis-hits this to mid-on"
0.2,"Cottrell to Smith, no run","slightly short of a length, slight swing back, defended to leg"
0.1,"Cottrell to Buttler, 1 run","slight shape back in, takes the inside edge for a single to fine leg"
19.6,"Archer to Pooran, SIX runs","the quicker short one, at 142ks, and Pooran gives Archer the taste of the medicine he himself gave Ngidi. Backs away to pull him for a flat six to midwicket to take 18 off this final over. Ideally, though, he shouldn't have been bowling this ball, but the umpire had other ideas"
19.5,"Archer to Pooran, no run","slower bouncer, 127ks, Pooran backs away to pull, but connects only with the dry Sharjah air"
19.4,"Archer to Pooran, no run","and he cramps him up with a quick length ball, and the bottom edge comes back to him"
19.3,"Archer to Pooran, FOUR runs","high full toss, and Pooran makes room to crash this over point for four more"
19.2,"Archer to Pooran, SIX runs","Pooran gets all of this. On-pace length ball, and he clears the front leg and lofts him over long-off for another big six"
19.1,"Archer to Maxwell, 1 run",mis-hit down to long-off for a single
19.1,"Archer to Maxwell, 1 wide","oh that is harsh. This is an excellent short ball under the armpit, but Maxwell has shuffled inside its line, and it misses the leg stump by one stump's width and he has called it a wide"
18.6,"Tom Curran to Pooran, 2 runs","Uthappa has dropped a skier. He has been off colour in the field all night. On-pace length ball, right in the slot, Pooran opens up the front leg to leg, but gets a massive top edge. Uthappa has ages to catch this but he misjudges it and ends up diving at extra-cover circle. Doesn't even get a hand to it"
18.5,"Tom Curran to Pooran, SIX runs","he gets the yorker wrong as you will do it every now and then, and Pooran smacks this low full toss over wide long-on for a huge six over the grandstand and into the streets of Sharjah"
18.4,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 run","lovely wide yorker to follow it up with, and all Maxwell can do it get a single"
18.3,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, no run",another dot as Maxwell tries a reverse ramp but can't catch up with the line of the ball outside off
18.2,"Tom Curran to Pooran, 1 run","dropped or saved his face?. Slower shortish ball well outside off, Pooran swipes across it, sending it back at Curran's face, who just puts his hand up to preserve his well-being. Doesn't attempt to catch it, and rightly so"
18.1,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 run","low full toss, cramps him up, Maxwell mis-hits it to wide long-on for one"
17.6,"Rajpoot to Rahul, OUT","just reward for Rajppot. He has hardly erred with his wide lines to Rahul. He shuffles wide this time to try to go over point but doesn't get power behind this open-face shot, and is caught at the square third man boundary"
17.5,"Rajpoot to Rahul, no run","yes he does go there, and Rahul tries the reverse ramp. There is no pace on it so he tries to whip him, and gets hit on the back of the bat"
17.4,"Rajpoot to Maxwell, 1 run","he bowls a full toss that cramps him up, and goes just for the single to long-on"
17.3,"Rajpoot to Maxwell, FOUR runs","back to bowling wide, but Maxwell manages to reach it. It just short of being a yorker, and Maxwell steers it over short third man"
17.2,"Rajpoot to Maxwell, FOUR runs","Rajpoot blinks. He sees Maxwell to off again, and goes straight this time. Maxwell wants just that because the field is set on the off side. He hits him over the infield on the leg side"
17.1,"Rajpoot to Maxwell, no run","and he succeeds here again. A wide slower ball, beats the Maxwell heave"
16.6,"Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 run","slower short ball, cut away but straight to deep point. Only the single. Another excellent over from RR. Just 13 off the last two overs"
16.5,"Tom Curran to Rahul, 1 run","slower legcutter, 111ks, short of a length, on off, pushed into the off side for one"
16.4,"Tom Curran to Rahul, no run","lovely yorker, 131ks, just outside off, and it kicks off the crease, and Buttler does really well to collect this. Great reaction"
16.3,"Tom Curran to Agarwal, OUT","follows him as he attempts a yokrer. He ends up bowling a low full toss but he has successfully managed to cramp Agarwal, taking his arms away from him. Agarwal still attempts a six, but ends up holing out to deep midwicket"
16.2,"Tom Curran to Agarwal, FOUR runs","in the slot, on-pace, and that is not good enough. Agarwal clears the front leg and hits this straight of the diving long-off"
16.1,"Tom Curran to Rahul, 1 run","high full toss, on the pads, hit to deep square for one"
15.6,"Rajpoot to Rahul, 1 run","no boundary in the 16th over with the score 178 for 0. That is excellent bowling, and to his plan. Ends with a wide low full toss for a single to deep cover"
15.5,"Rajpoot to Agarwal, 1 run","short of a length, wide, slow, and he hits him back over his head for a single"
15.4,"Rajpoot to Agarwal, no run","wide yorker, lovely bowling, squeezes under his bat"
15.3,"Rajpoot to Rahul, 1 run","stays wide, hiding the ball from their hits, gives just the single to deep cover"
15.2,"Rajpoot to Agarwal, 1 run","short of a length, wide, away from him, punched straight to extra cover"
15.1,"Rajpoot to Rahul, 1 run","wide length ball, drilled to deep cover for one"
15.1,"Rajpoot to Rahul, 1 wide","wide on the crease, bowls wide, called wide"
14.6,"Gopal to Agarwal, FOUR runs","Agarwal's first IPL hundred, and he has got there with improvisation. This shortish ball sits in the pitch, but he manages to loft it over extra cover and make it land between deep cover and long-off. Not the best timing as you expect but the placement is perfect. Gets a long hug from Rahul"
14.5,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, cut away for a single"
14.4,"Gopal to Rahul, no run","sharp turn from outside leg, and it stays low too. Rahul keeps it out, but that might interest Bishnoi and Ashwin"
14.3,"Gopal to Agarwal, 1 run","short of a length, wide, cut away to deep cover. As well as you can bowl in these circumstances"
14.2,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run",punched to extra cover for a single
14.1,"Gopal to Rahul, FOUR runs","and he draws another mis-hit. He has managed to hurry Rahul into the pull, and there is a deep midwicket in place, but it somehow goes wide of the man diving there"
13.6,"Archer to Agarwal, FOUR runs","tries the short quick one again, 139ks, but his short fine is up and this is not smart bowling with that field, Agarwal gets inside the line, and helps this over short fine"
13.5,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run",leading edge but it flies wide of cover for one. This is a slower ball
13.4,"Archer to Rahul, FOUR runs","lovely pull. Short of a length, straight, he gets inside the line, and sends this over square with his front leg in the air"
13.3,"Archer to Rahul, no run","full, quick, pushed to extra cover"
13.2,"Archer to Agarwal, 3 runs","slower ball, back of a length, Agarwal backs away to drive this in front of deep cover where Samson makes a diving save and manages to stay in"
13.1,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, no room, on-pace, gets a single to point"
12.6,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","wrong'un, just short of the driving length. Rahul goes back to work this to leg for one more"
12.5,"Gopal to Agarwal, 1 run","slider, short of a length, punched to deep midwicket"
12.4,"Gopal to Agarwal, no run","quicker, seam-up, beats him on the drive outside off"
12.3,"Gopal to Agarwal, SIX runs","there is no justice on this ground for bowlers. He seems to have beaten Agarwal in flight by bowling wide outside off, but Agarwal doesn't panic. He keeps his shape, and goes inside-out with the loft to clear wide long-off. Off the toe end"
12.3,"Gopal to Agarwal, 1 wide","short of a length, wide, trying to stay away from him. Called wide"
12.2,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","slows it down, bowls a low full toss, mis-iht to long-off for one"
12.1,"Gopal to Rahul, no run",Rahul looks for the extra-cover drive but can't beat the man
11.6,"Tom Curran to Agarwal, FOUR runs","slower ball, 108sk, wide outside off, Agarwal changes his shot and has the time to do so. He crashes this in front of the diving man at point for four more"
11.5,"Tom Curran to Rahul, 1 run","yorker, dug out to mid-off, takes a single to reach yet another fifty"
11.5,"Tom Curran to Rahul, 1 wide","slower bouncer, he beats the hook, but has been wided"
11.4,"Tom Curran to Rahul, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Curran goes for the wide yorker, and misses it by inches. Rahul short-arms this with an open face, over point for four more"
11.3,"Tom Curran to Agarwal, 1 run","slower ball, low full toss, driven to long-off for one"
11.2,"Tom Curran to Rahul, 1 run",opens the face to get a single to point this time
11.1,"Tom Curran to Rahul, SIX runs","and there the game plan changes. Now they will go both ends. Slower legcutter, Rahul waits on it, and pulls this short-of-a-length delivery nonchalantly over midwicket"
10.6,"Unadkat to Agarwal, 2 runs","slowr ball again, 109ks, on a length, middle and leg, pushed into the leg side for an easy two"

10.5,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball, 111ks, cramps him up again, Rahul takes a single to leg this time"
10.4,"Unadkat to Rahul, no run",he cramps Rahul up again. And he is looking only for singles. And this time Uthappa is sharp at point
10.3,"Unadkat to Agarwal, 1 run","digs this one in, Agarwal is looking to pull, but gets a thick edge over point for a single"
10.2,"Unadkat to Agarwal, FOUR runs","this will rub it in. Slower offcutter, Agarwal throws his bat at it, and the thick outside edge flies over short third man for four. Agarwal should not have been on strike"
10.1,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run","he will be upset that they have allowed Rahul the single. That is what he wants to do to get Agarwal on strike, and Unadkat has bowled a good delivery to cramp him. But the man at point, Uthappa, misfields"

9.4,"Tom Curran to Agarwal, no run",Parag saves a few with a dive at extra cover as Agarwal punches this shortish delivery
9.3,"Tom Curran to Agarwal, FOUR runs","slower ball, cuts in, it seems he has done Agarwal in, but he manages to change the shot so well that he punches it to the left of deep square for four more"
9.2,"Tom Curran to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, cut to third man for one"
9.1,"Tom Curran to Agarwal, 1 run","on a length, into the pads, worked away to deep square"
8.6,"Gopal to Rahul, no run",Rahul continues the anchor role. Looks for a single but finds the man at cover
8.5,"Gopal to Agarwal, 1 run","short of a length, hurried into the pull, gets a single to long-on"
8.4,"Gopal to Agarwal, SIX runs","Gopal can't claim moral victory in this one. Chips down the wicket, not exactly to the pitch of the ball but that only allows his room to swing his arms. And he smacks this clean over his head for another six"
8.3,"Gopal to Agarwal, 2 runs","picks the googly off the pitch, but adjusts in time and puts it in a hole on the leg side for a couple"
8.2,"Gopal to Agarwal, SIX runs","brave bowling, but Agarwal goes to his fifty with not the cleanest hit of the night. Gopal seems to have beaten him in the flight but even though it goes off the outside half of the bat, it clears long-off easily"
8.1,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, on the pads, worked away for a single"
7.6,"Tewatia to Rahul, 1 run","flighted outside off, Rahul takes a single to deep cover"
7.5,"Tewatia to Agarwal, 1 run","looks to cut this, but gets a bottom edge in front of point"
7.4,"Tewatia to Agarwal, FOUR runs","oh he pulls the length back, and Agarwal is quick to pull him over midwicket for four more"
7.3,"Tewatia to Agarwal, SIX runs","now he has smoked it clean. Stays beside the line of a flighted legbreak, and lofts it back over his head, and hits into the insignia of Sharjah Cricket Ground at the top of the grandstand"
7.2,"Tewatia to Agarwal, SIX runs","quicker, into the pads, and he goes back to pull it. Another mis-hit, but he has managed to place it in front of deep square leg. Another six"
7.1,"Tewatia to Rahul, 1 run","starts off with a slow flighted delivery, pushed to deep cover for one"
6.6,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, punched down to long-on. Excellent first over over Gopal"
6.5,"Gopal to Agarwal, 1 run","another mis-hit but he nearly gets a six. Once again he is beaten in the flight, but the shank nearly clears long-on. Parag at the fence jumps to try to catch it and lob it up for a rebound, but doesn't manage to take it clean. However, he makes sure he doesn't concede six and sends the ball back in before he lands beyond the rope"
6.4,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","slower through the air, on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
6.3,"Gopal to Agarwal, 1 run","draws a mis-hit. He has tossed it up, but the ball is shorter than what Agarwal expects. Still he has mis-hit it so much that it falls well short of long-on"
6.2,"Gopal to Rahul, 1 run","tossed up nicely, Rahul looks to sweep, looks like he will be beaten but he gets a bottom edge at the last moment"
6.1,"Gopal to Rahul, 2 runs","on a length, no turn, punched between deep square and deep midwicket for a rare two at this ground"
5.6,"Archer to Agarwal, no run","slower legcutter, 129ks, sits in the pitch, moves away a touch, squares him up slightly. Defended back to him"

5.2,"Archer to Agarwal, no run",looks to run this down but sends it straight to point
5.1,"Archer to Agarwal, no run","spot on this time. Close to the stumps, on a length, no room, defended back to him"
4.6,"Rajpoot to Rahul, FOUR runs","good news for Rajpoot: the free hit hasn't gone for six. Bad news: it has gone for four. Short of a length, not wide, but Rahul gets enough power with an open face to clear point"
4.6,"Rajpoot to Agarwal, (no ball) 1 bye","big wide down the leg side, Buttler fails to make a clean connection as it bounces in front of him so they run an extra run. Oh hello, it is a no-ball too. So he has to change his signal: no-ball takes precedence over the wide. So we have a free hit coming up"
4.5,"Rajpoot to Rahul, 1 run","on a length, just outside off, he has sweeper cover to keep them down to one. KL Rahul gets back the orange cap"
4.4,"Rajpoot to Agarwal, 1 run","into the pads, worked away to leg for one"
4.3,"Rajpoot to Agarwal, FOUR runs","and now the deft touch. Rajpoot goes wide on the crease, and but he provides Agarwal width with this shortish delivery. He opens the face to send this to the right of the diving Archer at short third man"
4.2,"Rajpoot to Agarwal, FOUR runs","slower short ball, 122ks, Agarwal makes the necessary adjustment after shaping up for the hook. He delays his shot, and pulls this over wide mid-on"
4.1,"Rajpoot to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, stump to stump, worked to leg for one"
3.6,"Archer to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball to end the over, 125ks, Rahul goes back to drop this at his toes and sneak in a single"
3.5,"Archer to Rahul, no run","short of a length, 138ks, it sits in the surface, Rahul has no room, he hits this straight to cover"
3.4,"Archer to Rahul, no run","finally a dot. Finally Archer gets the line, length and pace right. Not full enough to be driven. Pushed to cover"
3.3,"Archer to Rahul, FOUR runs","4, 4, 4. Wide full ball, and this time he throws his bat at it knowing the field restrictions. Over point he goes"
3.2,"Archer to Rahul, FOUR runs","Archer bowls on-pace now, but pitches it too full. Rahul is in too good a touch to be sparing these plum half-volleys. He is pinging the cover fence"
3.1,"Archer to Rahul, FOUR runs","lovely cover-drive. Archer starts off with a slower ball, at 106ks, and Rahul nonchalantly drives this length ball through cover"
2.6,"Unadkat to Agarwal, no run","short of a length, straight, Agarwal opens the face on it, but can't beat point"
2.5,"Unadkat to Agarwal, SIX runs","on-pace short ball, and Agarwal has already hit the second six of the night. Makes room as Unadkat looks to cramp him up, and then he swivels to pull it square on the leg side"
2.5,"Unadkat to Agarwal, 3 wide","Buttler needs to learn from Dhoni and get his legs behind such balls. Slower bouncer, too high, bounces in front of Buttler and he lets it through"
2.4,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run","slower offcutter again, 113ks, this time he drops it in front of point for a single"
2.3,"Unadkat to Rahul, 2 runs","beautiful push-drive through the covers, but the sweeper cover will keep them down to two"
2.2,"Unadkat to Agarwal, 1 run","slower offcutter, 114ks, Agarwal adjusts and pushes this to sweeper cover for one"
2.1,"Unadkat to Agarwal, FOUR runs","not a bad ball but Agarwal is quick to rock back and pull this short-of-a-length ball over midwicket for four. Not the best connection because the length is not there to be pulling, but he takes advantage of the field restrictions"
1.6,"Rajpoot to Agarwal, 1 run","on a length, around off, pushed wide of mid-on for one"
1.5,"Rajpoot to Agarwal, no run","beaten. Agarwal looks to open the face late to play this fine, but this short-of-a-length ball hits the seam and holds its line"
1.4,"Rajpoot to Agarwal, no run","wide on the crease, short of a length, pushed straight to cover"
1.3,"Rajpoot to Agarwal, SIX runs",and that is six no. 1. Agarwal doesn't bother with a sighter from Rajpoot. He backs away and lofts a length ball over mid-off. Not even off the middle of the bat. More of the toe end
1.2,"Rajpoot to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, runs it down to third man for one"
1.1,"Rajpoot to Rahul, no run","wide length ball, Rahul goes back to punch this square, but straight to point"

0.5,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run",tucked away off the hip to deep square leg
0.4,"Unadkat to Rahul, no run","extra bouncer, Rahul is surprised by it as the ball hits him on the maker's name. Kicks off from just short of a length. He manages to keep it down"
0.3,"Unadkat to Agarwal, 1 run","slight seam from a length just outside leg, Agarwal squared up a touch, but plays with soft hands for a single"
0.2,"Unadkat to Agarwal, no run","beaten. Seams to have seamed away after pitching on a length, on middle and leg. Agarwal pushes without conviction, and fails to make connection"
0.1,"Unadkat to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length, angling towards off, Rahul drops it at his toes and takes a single"
17.6,"Natarajan to Morgan, FOUR runs","finished with a boundary. Low full toss just outside off, stays leg side of it again and thumps it past the bowler's feet"
17.5,"Natarajan to Morgan, SIX runs","slapped a long way over long-on! Back of a length offcutter comes at a nice swinging height, and swing he does, with feet firmly rooted outside leg stump"
17.4,"Natarajan to Gill, 1 run","punched sweetly but into the stumps at the other end. Good length ball sliding in at the stumps, a disdainful drive through the line, splits the stumps"
17.4,"Natarajan to Gill, 1 wide","bouncer down leg side, left alone"
17.3,"Natarajan to Gill, no run","full and just outside off. Makes too much room backing into the leg side, mistimed drive to extra cover"

15.6,"Rashid Khan to Morgan, FOUR runs","bisects deep midwicket and deep square. Full at middle stump, gets low and with the front leg in the leg side. Creates a nice swinging arc and hits this where he wants to. That's the end of Rashid tonight"
15.5,"Rashid Khan to Gill, 1 run","full on off stump, driven with the turn to long-off"
15.4,"Rashid Khan to Morgan, 1 run","low full toss at middle stump, miscued reverse sweep and a half chance with their running but Natarajan can't collect cleanly at short third"

15.2,"Rashid Khan to Gill, no run","short outside off, cut to backward point"
15.1,"Rashid Khan to Gill, no run","good length outside off, driven to extra cover"
14.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Morgan, SIX runs",enough patting it around. Morgan clears the front leg in wait of the full slow ball outside off and creams it over the cover boundary
14.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, 1 run","good length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
14.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, 2 runs","overpitched on leg stump, drilled out to deep midwicket where there's a fumble"

12.3,"Natarajan to Gill, FOUR runs","brilliantly placed to bring up his fifty. Short of a good length, just outside off. Allows that to slide across him and slices past point off the front foot. Doing a fine job tonight, everything they'd have asked"

8.5,"Rashid Khan to Morgan, 1 run","good length on off stump, tapped to long-off's left off the back foot"
8.4,"Rashid Khan to Morgan, FOUR runs",reverse ramp and well clear of short third man. Expert stuff. Good length ball pushed across him and he uses the angle to lift it over that fielder
8.3,"Rashid Khan to Morgan, no run","full on middle stump, driven back at the bowler"
8.2,"Rashid Khan to Morgan, no run","full and just outside off, driven to extra cover"

7.6,"M Nabi to Gill, 1 run","short and just outside off, chopped to point"
7.5,"M Nabi to Morgan, 1 run","just short of deep square! His dangerous affair with the slog sweep continues. Drags this good length ball from outside off, it's flat and dipping on Bhuvi"

6.6,"Rashid Khan to Gill, 1 run","good length at off stump, driven on the rise to long-off"
6.5,"Rashid Khan to Morgan, 1 run",lbw appeal as he looks to sweep again. They won't review. Probably pitched outside leg
6.4,"Rashid Khan to Morgan, no run",bat-pad as he gingerly gets forward to try and defend this good length ball on middle stump
6.3,"Rashid Khan to Morgan, no run","full outside off, swept straight to short fine"
6.2,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, OUT","big appeal and given! Karthik doesn't pick the googly. And he doesn't take the review .oh hang on, the timer seemed to have gone past zero, but he has a review after all. Wondering if I missed his signal earlier, because this is very odd otherwise. Anyway, he was pushing forward, playing for a corridor line on this length ball. Was caught on the back leg right in front of middle. That takes the top of leg says tracker and well, they'll lose the review that was taken in bizarre circumstances. Certainly the TV timer had burnt out. Is there another timer on the field? Can be the only explanation"
6.1,"Rashid Khan to Gill, 1 run",good length and quickly through at middle stump. Flicked uppishly to deep midwicket
5.6,"Ahmed to Gill, 1 run","short at the hips, glanced to fine leg"
5.5,"Ahmed to Gill, FOUR runs","and now behind square on the off side. Predictable again, Khaleel. Short of a length at middle and off. Backs away once more and rolls his wrists on top of this, cuts into the floor, beats point to the right"
5.4,"Ahmed to Gill, FOUR runs",slaughtered. He knows exactly where Khaleel is going to bowl this. Short and at middle stump. Some extra juice with the fingers rolled over it too. All it does is give him more time and he slaps it over extra cover
5.3,"Ahmed to Gill, no run","short and just outside off, deflected to backward point off the back foot"
5.2,"Ahmed to Gill, no run",short slower ball at the hips. Flicked to square leg's right. DK wants the run and doesn't get a response from Gill. Dives at the other end as the throw misses
5.1,"Ahmed to Gill, no run","short at off stump, defended down the pitch"
4.6,"Natarajan to Karthik, no run","good length and just outside off, solidly punched back down the pitch"
4.5,"Natarajan to Karthik, no run","full and wide outside off, beaten on the attempted drive"
4.4,"Natarajan to Rana, OUT","caught behind! Feet rooted from Rana this time. I suppose one can lose discipline when it's coming off so nicely previously. This is good length, lands on the seam and goes away marginally outside off. No forward stride and that's a drive away from the body. Thin edge and some Test match flashbacks for Saha"
4.3,"Natarajan to Rana, FOUR runs","easy. Too easy. Full toss on middle stump, offers the full face and bisects non-striker and the stumps. He's probably practiced this with two cones since he was 12. Poor from Natarajan"
4.2,"Natarajan to Gill, 1 run","yorker at the toes, jammed to midwicket's right"
4.1,"Natarajan to Gill, no run","good length on leg stump, flicked straight to short fine"
3.6,"Ahmed to Gill, 1 run","short at middle stump, gets tall on that and pulls into the turf to find deep midwicket"
3.5,"Ahmed to Rana, 1 leg bye",good length and slams the pad as he looks for another glance
3.4,"Ahmed to Rana, no run","nice diving stop from Saha. Good length ball into the pads, misses on the glance but it's off his pad. Saha gets his right hand to it"
3.3,"Ahmed to Rana, FOUR runs","cut wide of third man. Short and wide from Khaleel, Rana goes intentionally aerial. Easy runs"
3.2,"Ahmed to Rana, FOUR runs",oh beautiful. He's come out with some rhythm tonight. Everything just connecting sweetly. Short and in at middle and leg. Leaps off his feet and turns this off the hips. It blazes out to the square leg boundary
3.1,"Ahmed to Rana, FOUR runs","top edge over the slip.Slammed short of a length just outside off, was looking to turn that behind square leg with a hook. No position for it, but perfectly in position to get runs at third man"
2.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Rana, 1 run","full slower ball on the pads, flicked to midwicket's left"
2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rana, no run",easy catch for midwicket. No run. Full ball on middle and he'll be disappointed not to get this chip over that infielder
2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, (no ball) 1 run","awkward half-pull as this short ball gets big. Definitely an area teams are targeting him. He backs out of this pull from outside off, and it's a bunt towards mid-on. But the siren has gone off, which means Bhuvi has overstepped"
2.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Rana, 1 run","good length outside off, pushed into the off side with soft hands"
2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rana, FOUR runs","punched between extra cover and mid-off. Timing spot on so far for Rana! Just short of a good length and he's behind the line once more, lovely balance and the full face offered"
2.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rana, no run",rises past the outside edge. Good length ball gets steep as he has a push outside off
2.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rana, FOUR runs","sumptuous. Good length and across him. A bit of a shuffle of the back leg to get his head on top of that, and then opens the face on the punch to beat point"
1.6,"Ahmed to Gill, no run","good length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
1.5,"Ahmed to Gill, SIX runs","oh how did he do that? Ridiculous ease. This is a good length ball starting outside off and angling away, he has no business clearing long-on. But he does. Steps out, doesn't let that run away from and simply has a flap and gets it off the middle"
1.4,"Ahmed to Gill, no run","short at off stump, defended to point off the back foot"
1.3,"Ahmed to Gill, no run","short of a length and pushed across the corridor, left alone"
1.2,"Ahmed to Narine, OUT","sliced and mid-off takes it. Warner himself, and he is ecstatic. Slammed in short of a length at a middle stump line. Looks for the pull but this has stayed a touch low. It's a feeble slice in the end. Warner with a loud call and that is another failure for Narine against bowling that isn't good length or fuller"
1.1,"Ahmed to Narine, no run",short of a length and climbing up at his hips. Backs away a touch but is forced to defend off the back foot
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, no run",good length and some shape away from off stump. Forces him to defend into the covers
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, no run","good length and into the stumps, steps out and taps to mid-on"
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, FOUR runs",flicked aerially and quite deliberately through square leg. Good length ball slanted into him and an easy put away
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, no run",good length and swung away outside off. Left alone
0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, no run","full inswinger at the stumps, sweetly timed flick, straight to midwicket"
0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill, 2 runs","graceful to start. Short of a good length outside off, some shape away. Nicely onto the front foot to drive on the rise between cover and extra"
19.6,"Russell to M Nabi, 1 bye","beaten. Full tosses the way for Russell until those last four balls. Slammed in, going across the corridor and rapidly past the attempted hook. DK misses the gather"
19.5,"Russell to Abhishek, 1 bye","missed run out at the non-striker's end. But another mean short ball across Sharma that he has no answer to. Well beaten on the cut. Karthik lobs it to Russell, who catches, turns and has a big throw at the stumps to miss"
19.4,"Russell to Abhishek, 2 runs","sliced but safe in the leg side. Slower short ball, looks for the pull but is through it early"
19.3,"Russell to Abhishek, no run","rapid and past his ribs. Short and across the corridor. Looks to use the pace and nudge it to third man, but that's long past him"
19.2,"Russell to M Nabi, 1 run, OUT","Saha run out at the striker's end. Full ball outside off, Nabi mistimes the drive, along the floor to long-off. Saha wants the second but is sent back. Puts in a dive but he won't make it. A forgettable innings for him, couldn't get anything away tonight"
19.1,"Russell to M Nabi, FOUR runs","expertly done! Low full toss pushed across off stump  but Nabi has jumped into line and with a quick wristy flick, he's sent that to the deep square boundary"
18.6,"Shivam Mavi to Saha, no run","oh that looked wide. Another slower ball at a good length, just wide of the marker in my opinion. Saha was reaching a long way out to miss that one"
18.6,"Shivam Mavi to Saha, 1 wide","attempted offcutter, good length, but very wide"
18.5,"Shivam Mavi to Saha, no run","beaten. This was in the slot. Just outside off, shuffled and was close to the line. But swung from too far outside the line. Beaten on the inside edge"
18.4,"Shivam Mavi to M Nabi, 1 run","top edge to short fine's right. Another slower short ball, this one up above the right shoulder. Has a swish but can't control that. Would have had a wide if he didn't connect on it"
18.3,"Shivam Mavi to M Nabi, no run",beaten. Slower short ball again and he's through the cut too soon
18.2,"Shivam Mavi to M Nabi, FOUR runs","oh, clobbered. Short of a good length and sitting right up outside off. Awful tennis forehand, wonderful cricket shot. Well in front of sweeper cover"
18.1,"Shivam Mavi to M Nabi, no run","slower short ball just outside off, beaten on the pull"
17.6,"Russell to Saha, FOUR runs","dropped at deep backward point! Nagarkoti, rated very highly as an outfielder, has lost this completely. It's a full toss on leg stump, he was looking to hit over midwicket. Leading edge floats out to Nagarkoti who comes in and back, then hangs on for a bit and lunges back and to his left again as this evades him and bounce over the boundary"
17.6,"Russell to Saha, 1 wide","full and very wide outside off, can't get bat after reaching out at that"
17.5,"Russell to M Nabi, 1 run","full and wide outside off, shuffles and drives to sweeper cover"
17.4,"Russell to Pandey, OUT","awkwardly bunts a high full toss back to the bowler. Umpires are checking if it was above the waist. Straight into his mid-riff, that. He was hopping and lobbed it straight back up for Russell. It's about thigh high. Pandey will go back. He was shaping to play the ramp. Caught off guard, but it is a legal delivery"
17.3,"Russell to Saha, 1 run","full and pushed wide across him, reaches out and just manages to get bat on it. Along the floor to sweeper cover"
17.2,"Russell to Pandey, 1 run","low full toss outside off, shuffles and slugs along the floor to deep midwicket"
17.1,"Russell to Saha, 1 run",looks to scoop but ends up slicing this low full toss to short fine's right off the high part of the bat
16.6,"Cummins to Pandey, no run","beaten. Good length and wide outside off, can't connect on the slash"
16.5,"Cummins to Saha, 1 run","full outside off, backs into the leg side but is forced to hurry and get a bat on this. Sliced to third man's right"
16.4,"Cummins to Pandey, 1 run","offcutter, short and just outside off. Chopped to sweeper's left to bring up his fifty"
16.3,"Cummins to Pandey, FOUR runs","just beats mid-off! Unconventional shot - a flat-batted jab with the front leg in the leg side. It's short and rising outside off, and he pushes out at it. Between bowler mid-off"
16.2,"Cummins to Saha, 1 run","inside edge past the stumps. Slower short ball, wide outside off. Completely miscues the pull"
16.1,"Cummins to Pandey, 1 run","short and just outside off, chopped to backward point"
15.6,"Varun to Saha, SIX runs","just past deep midwicket! Good length, googly outside off. Steps out and swings through the line with some hope. It's off the inside half of the bat and just lifts over the boundary as the fielder runs to his right"
15.5,"Varun to Saha, no run","left alone and that is just inside the wide line. Quicker one delivered with the fingers, wide outside off"
15.4,"Varun to Pandey, 1 run","good length, googly. Into the pads. Flicked to deep square"
15.3,"Varun to Pandey, 2 runs","quicker one, dropped short outside off. Pulled firmly to deep midwicket's left"

14.5,"Narine to Saha, 1 run","good length at off stump, backs away and mistimes a drive to long-off"
14.4,"Narine to Pandey, 1 run","good length at middle stump, clipped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
14.3,"Narine to Saha, 1 leg bye","appeal for lbw is turned down. Good length at middle stump, looks to sweep the offbreak. Cops it on the back leg, around leg stump"

13.5,"Nagarkoti, to Pandey, 1 run","offcutter, full at middle stump. Clipped to deep midwicket's left"
13.4,"Nagarkoti, to Pandey, FOUR runs","clean. Usually is when he middles them. Overpitched outside off, stays leg side of it but with a decent stride in. Uses his wrists to get it wide of mid-off"
13.3,"Nagarkoti, to Saha, 1 run","short and in at middle stump, pulled to midwicket"
13.2,"Nagarkoti, to Saha, 2 runs","good length at off stump, 140.4kph, sliced on the up to sweeper's left"

11.6,"Varun to Pandey, 1 run","good length at middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
11.5,"Varun to Pandey, FOUR runs","against mystery bowlers you need tricks of your own. In this case, Pandey chucks his hands out at a full wide ball, has a chop at it and is completely out of shape, not to mention swishing with only one hand. For his efforts, an under-edge nutmegs DK and he gets four. Sure he worked hard on that in the nets"
11.4,"Varun to Saha, 1 run",good length and a speculative jump down the pitch from Saha. Forced to reach out with one hand in the end and turn this towards deep square
11.3,"Varun to Pandey, 1 run","full outside off, driven along the floor to long-off"
11.2,"Varun to Saha, 1 run",full and up outside off. Big stride outside to flick to long-on
11.1,"Varun to Saha, no run",short and wide outside off. Saha backing into the leg side gets himself too far to execute the cut
10.6,"Nagarkoti, to Saha, 1 run","offcutter, turning in from a good length at off stump. 114.5kph. Dropped pitch side on the off side with soft hands"
10.5,"Nagarkoti, to Saha, no run","full at off stump, 136kph, flicked straight to short midwicket"

10.3,"Nagarkoti, to Saha, 1 leg bye","full and into the pads again, cops that on the pad as he looks to flick. Inside edge on it, it appears"
10.2,"Nagarkoti, to Saha, 2 runs","oh sensational from Cummins at deep midwicket! Give him some more money. Full and into the pads. Flicked with brilliant timing. Cummins sprints to his right, slides on his hips and flicks this back in for deep square leg who was running to his left"
10.1,"Nagarkoti, to Pandey, 1 run","good length outside off, 141kph. Driven to mid-off's left on the rise"
9.6,"Varun to Pandey, 1 run","good length outside off, watchfully tapped out to sweeper cover"

9.4,"Varun to Saha, no run","good length and sliding on outside off, punched to point off the front foot"
9.3,"Varun to Saha, no run","KKR review the lbw call. Saha also fails to pick the ball that spins inwards. Good length, on the front foot trying to drive at an off stump line. He's caught in front of middle and leg, just above the knee. UltraEdge has nothing on it. Clipping the top of leg so it will be umpire's call"
9.2,"Varun to Saha, no run","full outside off, pushed back down the pitch off the front foot"
9.1,"Varun to Warner, OUT","got him first ball after the break! What a return for this guy. Once again, it's that wristy release that looks like it'll be a legcutter, but goes straight on. It's flicked off the middle finger, cross-seam. Will not spin inwards. Warner looks to flick, an indication that maybe he was looking for the one that comes in when it's delivered like that. But it gets the top of the bat and floats back to the bowler whose little fairytale now has Warner as a lead character"
8.6,"Kuldeep to Warner, 1 run","short of a good length outside off, chopped to sweeper cover"
8.5,"Kuldeep to Pandey, 1 run","quicker one delivered with the front of the hand. 106kph, short and at the legs stump. Whipped aerially towards deep square"
8.4,"Kuldeep to Warner, 1 run","short outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
8.3,"Kuldeep to Pandey, 1 run",fuller and flatter and wide outside off this time. Nice adjustment. Pandey steps out again but can only drag along the floor to long-on
8.2,"Kuldeep to Pandey, SIX runs","clears the wide long-on boundary this time. Lobbed up at a good length, steps right out and completes the swing nicely to send this 84 metres"
8.1,"Kuldeep to Pandey, no run","full on middle stump, clears the front leg and miscues his slog. Trickles low to midwicket's right"
7.6,"Varun to Warner, no run","good length, just outside off, driven on the up to backward point"
7.5,"Varun to Warner, 2 runs","offbreak, good length and quick at middle stump. Hurriedly swept to deep square's right. Misfield by Rana"
7.4,"Varun to Pandey, 1 run","fingerspin this time. Dropped short outside off, pulled firmly out to deep midwicket"
7.3,"Varun to Pandey, no run","goes wristspin again. Short of a length, pitching and cutting into Pandey, who cops that on the thigh"
7.2,"Varun to Pandey, no run","short of a good length outside off, punched to extra cover off the back foot"
7.1,"Varun to Warner, 1 run","wristspinner to start. It slides on across Warner, who cuts to sweeper cover"
6.6,"Kuldeep to Pandey, no run","good length outside off, gets forward and flicks it back down the pitch"
6.5,"Kuldeep to Warner, 1 run","good length, just outside off. Looks to pull but that slides on straight. Inside edge onto boot for a single in the covers"

6.1,"Kuldeep to Warner, 2 runs","good length outside off, steps out and drives with the turn to long-off's right"

5.5,"Cummins to Warner, no run","good length and in at middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
5.4,"Cummins to Warner, FOUR runs","swats him in front of deep square. Short and up at the ribs. Wrner quickly gets the head out of the way, doesn't bother to keep that down. One bounce and over the line"

5.2,"Cummins to Warner, 1 run","good length and into middle stump, punched to mid-on with the angle"

4.5,"Shivam Mavi to Pandey, 1 run","good length outside off, gets forward and clips into the midwicket region which is now vacant because of his last shot"
4.4,"Shivam Mavi to Pandey, SIX runs","oh sweeeeeet! What a clean strike that is. If any shot comes naturally to Pandey, it's this front foot pull over midwicket. Shuffles to get into Mavi's line outside off and when it rises, he swings cleanly from under that. Nailed off the middle to get off the mark"
4.3,"Shivam Mavi to Pandey, no run","good length just outside off, punched into the covers on the rise"
4.2,"Shivam Mavi to Pandey, no run","good length outside off, forced into the covers off the front foot"
4.1,"Shivam Mavi to Warner, 1 run","good length and onto the pads, tucked through square leg from the crease"
3.6,"Cummins to Bairstow, OUT","bowled him next ball!  Looks like an offcutter. Bairstow swishing all over this. Just an incoming ball hitting the seam, in fact. Bowlers know Bairstow is vulnerable to that ball. And it shows rather pertinently in this instance. Good length ball, pitching in the corridor with a tilt inwards. Bairstow looking to drive on the rise for the line. Off and middle both visible. You don't do that and get away often against this bowler"
3.5,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run","taken by DK but Bairstow has reviewed immediately. He was looking for the ramp agains this good length ball in the corridor. Got entangled, and it seemed to hit the back leg and lob up for DK in the slips region. Was there bat after pad though? Doesn't look like it. And he's struck outside off. This will remain not out."
3.4,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run","past the inside edge again. This time Bairstow looking to go horizontal batted with the cut. Good length ball skids underneath, just outside off"
3.3,"Cummins to Warner, 1 run","good length and in at middle stump, punched to mid-off"
3.2,"Cummins to Warner, no run","narrowly over off stump. Well it's no mystery what the angle's going to be - into him from wide of the crease. So Warner has set up for the pull shot already, but it doesn't bounce up as much as he expects"
3.1,"Cummins to Bairstow, 1 run","slams it in, short of a good length, and angles it into Bairstow. He's looking to back away for the cut and gets an inside edge to short fine's right"
2.6,"Narine to Warner, FOUR runs","hammered to deep midwicket's right! Everything you associate with Warner. Quick feet to go deep in the crease, and quick hands pulling firmly in front of square. First real short ball from Narine today and he is duly punished"
2.5,"Narine to Bairstow, 1 run","good length on the legs, whipped to short fine's left off the back foot"
2.4,"Narine to Warner, 1 run","good length at middle stump, punched to long-off's right"
2.3,"Narine to Warner, SIX runs","drags it over the wide long-on boundary. Not to the pitch of this good length ball at middle stump, but little risk going in that direction as mid-on is in the circle. Too far for deep midwicket to come close"
2.2,"Narine to Bairstow, 1 run","short of a good length, turning in at middle stump. Punched to extra cover's right off the back foot"
2.1,"Narine to Warner, 1 run","good length at off stump, punched to long-off with the turn"
1.6,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run",full and slanted in at middle stump. Watchfully defended
1.5,"Cummins to Warner, 1 run","short of a good length, in the corridor. Tapped to cover point's left off the back foot"
1.4,"Cummins to Warner, no run",short of a good length and honing in for his off stump again. No room. Defended down the pitch
1.3,"Cummins to Warner, no run",deflected towards the slip cordon as he's tucked up at the thigh trying to whip this rising ball through square leg
1.2,"Cummins to Bairstow, 1 run","good length and just outside off. 143.6kph, a bit of wobble in the corridor. But he's nicely forward to stab this to cover's left"
1.1,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run","good length at off stump, defended off the thick outside edge, to short third man"
0.6,"Narine to Bairstow, 1 run","good length and turning in at middle stump, leans forward and flicks gently to mid-on's right"
0.5,"Narine to Warner, 1 run",good length at leg stump shoveled to deep midwicket off the back foot
0.4,"Narine to Warner, 2 runs","good length at off stump, deep in the crease for a hurried punch to long-off's right. Nice confident call to beat the fielder's throw"
0.3,"Narine to Warner, no run","good length at middle stump, cramped and having to make some pace for himself. Just pats it back down off the front foot"
0.2,"Narine to Warner, no run","full on off stump, makes room and drives straight to extra cover"
0.1,"Narine to Warner, 2 runs","full outside off, brings down the hammer on that, crunched to long-off's right off the front foot"
19.6,"Rabada to Jadeja, OUT",that's that. One more for Rabada. Three wickets at the death. Jadeja just gives catching pressure to Mishra at point
19.5,"Rabada to Sam Curran, 1 run",shuffles across to work this slower ball into the leg side
19.4,"Rabada to Sam Curran, no run","short of a length straight, defended"
19.3,"Rabada to Dhoni, OUT","Dhoni walks off. Doesn't wait to see if this low catch is clean or not. Rabada rolls his fingers on the short ball, Dhoni gets a top edge thanks to the extra bounce, and Pant dives in front to take the catch"
19.2,"Rabada to Jadeja, 1 run","slower ball, on leg, makes room to take a single to point"
19.1,"Rabada to Jadeja, 2 runs","Jadeja makes room, Rabada's length ball gets big on hi, and he mis-hits it over mid-off. Again hit high on the bat"
18.6,"Nortje to Jadeja, 1 run",down the wicket to drive this slower ball to deep cover
18.5,"Nortje to Jadeja, no run","quick again, hits him on the pad as he looks to slog to leg. Pant collects it on the bounce"
18.5,"Nortje to Jadeja, 1 wide","sharp bouncer, 138ks, but this time it is a tough too high. Called a wide"
18.5,"Nortje to Jadeja, 1 wide",down the leg side. That will be a wide
18.4,"Nortje to Dhoni, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, pulled down to long-on for one"
18.3,"Nortje to Dhoni, no run","legcutter length ball, he is late into it, and is hit high on the bat"
18.2,"Nortje to Jadeja, 1 run","quick short ball, Jadeja is late into it, and gets a single off the top edge. Over five a ball now. Just to keep you informed"
18.1,"Nortje to Dhoni, 1 run","low full toss, driven hard to deep cover for one"
17.6,"Rabada to Dhoni, 1 run","top edge. Rabada hurrying him with a bouncer, but it lands wide of the sweeper on the leg side"
17.5,"Rabada to Jadeja, 1 run","short of a length, around off, pushed down the ground for one"
17.4,"Rabada to Jadeja, FOUR runs","dug in short, smartly played by Jadeja who makes room and guides this between short third and point"
17.3,"Rabada to Jadeja, 2 runs","short of a length, angling in from round the wicket, bunted into a hole on the leg side for a couple"
17.2,"Rabada to du Plessis, OUT","finally. Faf has edged one straight to a fielder, and the said fielder completes the catch. He is backing away again, and Rabada smartly slips in a wide delivery, and the outside edge settles with Pant"
17.1,"Rabada to du Plessis, 2 runs","and Faf is outdoing all cats. What will it take for one chance to stick. He backs away to manage just a toe-ended skier, and Hetmyer drops him at mid-off"
16.6,"Avesh Khan to du Plessis, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, and all Fafa manages is an inside edge to fine leg"
16.5,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, 1 run","low full toss, Dhoni can't get power behind it, but this falls well short of deep midwicket"
16.4,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, FOUR runs","oh he doesn't bowl to his field. Gives him a low full toss outside leg, and he helps it along for four to fine leg"
16.3,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, no run","length ball, angling across, punched straight to extra cover"
16.2,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, no run","lovely comeback. Slower bouncer, outside off, Dhoni, well early into the shot"
16.1,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, FOUR runs",low full toss. Dhoni looks in good touch. Drills this back over Avesh's head for four
15.6,"Nortje to Dhoni, 3 runs","short, wide, he backs away and hits this point for three"
15.5,"Nortje to Dhoni, no run","sharp bouncer, quick, 145ks, over his left shoulder, too good. Dhoni late into the hook. And not even too high"
15.4,"Nortje to Jadhav, OUT","that is plumb lbw. The asking rate means he has to do something out of the ordinary, and Nortje is too good. Runs the fingers on a length ball that is headed straight for the stumps. Jadhav is looking to slog it and is beaten comprehensively. No question of a review"
15.3,"Nortje to du Plessis, 1 run","full and straight and slower at 125ks, runs off the inside edge for another single. If there is no boundary this over, it might just be it for CSK"
15.2,"Nortje to Jadhav, 1 run","yorker, or just a couple of inches off one. Hit down to long-on for one"
15.1,"Nortje to du Plessis, 1 run","du Plessis man. He has more lives than a cat. A length ball cramping him up, mis-hit to leg, but doesn't carry to midwicket. And then he is sent back and beats the direct hit by a frame, and even gets an overthrow"
14.6,"Rabada to du Plessis, 1 run","yorker, almost one, straight at the stumps. Faf digs it out for one. And he has come back well to end this over"
14.5,"Rabada to du Plessis, no run","beaten comprehensively. Bashing a short length, and Faf charges at him and is beaten by the bouncer. The mid-off is up, which brings about this shot. And that length"
14.4,"Rabada to Jadhav, 1 run","quick straight, back of a length, hits him on the pad. Another leg-bye"
14.3,"Rabada to Jadhav, FOUR runs","has he edged it or placed it? Quick, short of a length, and he has actually opened the face late and beaten third man to his left. Late touch"
14.2,"Rabada to du Plessis, 1 leg bye","really quick, draws a grunt out of du Plessus as this hits him on the body after following him with the angle. Only a leg-bye here"
14.1,"Rabada to du Plessis, FOUR runs","on a length, cramping him, but du Plessis gets enough bat on this to clear midwicket for four"
13.6,"Avesh Khan to du Plessis, 1 run","they are in a biosecure bubble or I would tell Faf to walk into a casino soon as this match finishes. Tries the ramp, but Avesh bowls wide, and he tries the revrse ramp, and the thick outside flies towards third man but falls short"
13.5,"Avesh Khan to Jadhav, 1 run","length ball, driven to extra cover for one"
13.5,"Avesh Khan to Jadhav, 1 wide",looks for the yorker on the stumps with Jadhav shuffling across. Ends up slipping down the leg side
13.4,"Avesh Khan to Jadhav, 2 runs","slower ball, and he is lucky again. Tries to go big down the ground, and gets a top edge to this length ball, but clears mid-off"
13.3,"Avesh Khan to Jadhav, FOUR runs","clears mid-off, and it is a tall man too. Down the wicket, and slaps this down the ground but not with great elevation. Nortje leaps at mid-off, but it just six inches too high"
13.2,"Avesh Khan to Jadhav, no run","short of a length, wide, and he is beaten on the cut by the extra bounce"
13.1,"Avesh Khan to Jadhav, FOUR runs","smashing shot. Shuffles across, not a high back lift, and he punches a length ball past midwicket. Great power"
12.6,"Mishra to du Plessis, 2 runs","more fortune for Faf. Looks for the sweep from outside off, and gets a bottom edge for a couple"
12.5,"Mishra to Jadhav, 1 run","quicker slider, hit into the leg side, but gets just a single"
12.4,"Mishra to du Plessis, 1 run","slower legbreak, punched down to long-off"
12.3,"Mishra to du Plessis, 2 runs","down the wicket, Mishra yorks him with a quick one, pushed wide of long-on for two"
12.2,"Mishra to du Plessis, FOUR runs","nearly the wicket. Down the wicket, beaten in the flight, and the thick outside edge just evades the man at point"
12.1,"Mishra to Jadhav, 1 run","quick, length, outside off, punched to deep cover"
11.6,"Avesh Khan to Jadhav, 1 run","short of a length, wide, cut away for one"
11.5,"Avesh Khan to Jadhav, no run",appeal for a catch at the wicket but it has come off the pad
11.4,"Avesh Khan to du Plessis, 1 run","now Hetmer drops one. After Kohli and Finch and Shaw. Du Plessis lets out a grunt as this short ball gets big on him as he looks to upper-cut. Hetmyer is sweeping and runs in, and this is straight at his throat but he drops it. Hits his chest"
11.3,"Avesh Khan to du Plessis, FOUR runs","makes room to slog this across the line, and manages to place it between deep square and fine leg. Just the fifth boundary of the innings"
11.2,"Avesh Khan to du Plessis, no run","shuffles across to look to go over extra cover, and is beaten by the ball that holds its line"
11.1,"Avesh Khan to Jadhav, 1 run","length ball, outside off, punched to deep cover"
10.6,"Mishra to Jadhav, 1 run","sharp turn from a length, just outside leg, and all he can manage is a punch down to long-on for a single"

10.4,"Mishra to Jadhav, 1 run","goes back to pull a length ball, gets a single to deep midwicket"
10.3,"Mishra to du Plessis, 1 run","down the wicket, too close to the pitch of the it, gets a single to long-on"
10.2,"Mishra to Jadhav, 1 run","sharp, dipping, punched to long-off for one"
10.1,"Mishra to du Plessis, 1 run","wrong'un, Faf goes back to work this to leg for one"
9.6,"Axar Patel to Jadhav, 2 runs",delicate late cut to a fullish ball. Patel hasn't bowl quick so he gets just the two for this
9.5,"Axar Patel to Jadhav, no run","slows this down, full, middle and leg, defended back"
9.4,"Axar Patel to Jadhav, no run","tossed up wide, Jadhav, being short, can go back and cut, but he fails to beat short third man"
9.3,"Axar Patel to Jadhav, no run","nice dip on this, on a length, on off, pushed to cover"
9.2,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","length ball, into the pads, worked to leg for one"
9.1,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, OUT","do we have a run-out here? Yes we do. Du Plessis refuses the single when it is Gaekwad's call. Bottom edge behind square, and that should be the non-striker's call. Faf takes a couple of steps and sends him back after he has come halfway up the wicket. Pant is quick, gets the glove off, slides, throws, Patel doesn't collect clean but still has time to recover and run him out"
8.6,"Mishra to Gaikwad, no run","sharp turn from outside leg, beats his sweep, hits him on the pad"
8.5,"Mishra to du Plessis, 1 run","leading edge as he looks to work this to leg, and Dhawan makes a diving save at point, much to the joy of Pant and Iyer, who seem to lov Dhawan"
8.4,"Mishra to du Plessis, no run","jumps out of the crease, Mishra bowls the slider, beats him in flight, and an inside edge saves him from getting stumped"
8.3,"Mishra to Gaikwad, 1 run","falls short again. Again sweeping against the turn, gets another top edge, and this doesn't carry to long leg"
8.2,"Mishra to Gaikwad, no run","slider, cramps him up as he looks to run it past short third. Bottom edge"
8.1,"Mishra to du Plessis, 1 run",Faf gets away. The second time he has tried a slog sweep against the turn of a big spinner. The top edge falls short of deep midwicket. Very lucky to get away with it
7.6,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","on a length, no room, he backs away to punch this to long-off for one"
7.5,"Axar Patel to Gaikwad, 1 run","flat, fired in, worked to deep square"
7.4,"Axar Patel to Gaikwad, no run","flighted, straight, driven back to the bowler"
7.3,"Axar Patel to Gaikwad, no run",looks to make room to cut but can't beat cover-point
7.2,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","looking for the paddle sweep, gets an inside edge into his helmet. Still good for a single"
7.1,"Axar Patel to Gaikwad, 1 run","on a length, outside off, driven to long-off for one"
6.6,"Mishra to du Plessis, no run","looks to slog this to leg, but gets a thick edge to roll it towards point"
6.5,"Mishra to Gaikwad, 1 run","turn here. Nice turn. Short ball, Gaekwad looks to pull but the turn makes sure he can't hit this where he wants it. Gets a single to deep midwicket"
6.4,"Mishra to Gaikwad, no run",is this the wrong'un? Goes past the inside edge to hit the pad
6.3,"Mishra to du Plessis, 1 run",shuffles across to drive this full ball down to long-off for one
6.2,"Mishra to du Plessis, no run","slow in the air, around off, Faf plays off the back foot, back to Mishra"
6.1,"Mishra to Gaikwad, 1 run","flighted outside off, pushed slightly wide of cover, and Faf calls him through for one"
5.6,"Nortje to Vijay, OUT",Vijay's frustrating stay ends. Hard length against a batsman under pressure to hit out almost always works. The bat turns in his hand as he swings hard at it. Lobs it for a catch to midwicket
5.5,"Nortje to Vijay, no run","big bouncer, and it keeps rising after crossing the batsman, and Pant makes a good overhead one-handed collection"
5.4,"Nortje to Vijay, no run","Vijay looks for the big hit over mid-off, but is hit on the inside half of the bat"
5.3,"Nortje to du Plessis, 1 run","on a length, wicket to wicket, worked to deep square leg for one"
5.2,"Nortje to du Plessis, 2 runs","short of a length, straight, punched towards deep midwicket for two"
5.1,"Nortje to du Plessis, FOUR runs","on a length, into the pads, and he uses all his pace with a deflection wide of square leg for four. He is carrying forward that from from the last game"
5.1,"Nortje to du Plessis, 1 wide","starts with a tight line, and it swings further down the leg side"
4.6,"Axar Patel to Vijay, no run","fired into the pads, the deflection can't beat short fine leg"
4.5,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run",pushed wide of the diving Patel to his left
4.4,"Axar Patel to Vijay, 1 run","flighted outside off, driven to long-off for one"
4.3,"Axar Patel to du Plessis, 1 run","on a length, straight, worked wide of mid-on for one"
4.2,"Axar Patel to Watson, OUT",make it one more success for Patel against Watson. The analysts will love it. A sixth wicket of Watson in under 60 balls. Watson is keen to break the hold and is looking for one big hit. He seems this flat and goes back to pull but it skids an and he doesn't get the power or the elevation. Easy catch for deep midwicket. It is acutally not that easy. Hetmyer is taken aback by the power behind the shot but he has done well
4.1,"Axar Patel to Vijay, 1 run","Vijay is looking to make room and go over extra cover, but gets an inside edge to square leg for one"
3.6,"Avesh Khan to Watson, no run","better delivery, just outside off, Watson looks to drop it and run, but hasn't created any distance between the bowler and the ball"
3.5,"Avesh Khan to Watson, SIX runs","Watto checks in. Pure muscle and timing. Breaks the back knee to get under a length ball, and sends this flying over wide mid-on. A thousand CSK runs for Watson"
3.4,"Avesh Khan to Vijay, 1 run","another single to third man, playing length balls with an open face"
3.3,"Avesh Khan to Watson, 1 run","similar delivery, similar shot, finds the gap this time to get a single to third man"
3.2,"Avesh Khan to Watson, no run","on a length, just outside off, opens the face, can't beat point"
3.1,"Avesh Khan to Watson, FOUR runs","thick inside edge for four. A subdued Watson likes this slightly lower pace and drives, but it runs off the inside half of the bat to beat mid-on"
2.6,"Nortje to Watson, 1 run","breaks the maiden with a steer down to third man, but this is a testing over that Watson has been fortunate to survive"
2.5,"Nortje to Watson, no run","on a length, around off, holds its line, pushed to cover"
2.4,"Nortje to Watson, no run","this is a legcutter at mid-140s. Too good. Watson looks to steer it after this pitches short of a length, and is beaten comprehensively"
2.3,"Nortje to Watson, no run","dropped. Ordinary cricket this ball. Nortje slips down the leg side, but Watson fails to beat square leg, but Shaw fluffs a sitter after two attempts at it"
2.2,"Nortje to Watson, no run","seam movement. Too good. A length ball jagging back in at 146ks, going between bat and pad, and somehow missing the stumps"
2.1,"Nortje to Watson, no run","full, on off, quick, driven sweetly but straight to mid-off"
1.6,"Axar Patel to Vijay, FOUR runs",Vijay makes room and makes good of this over by lofting him over mid-on
1.5,"Axar Patel to Watson, 1 run","again short, Watson rocks back to punch him to deep midwicket for one"
1.4,"Axar Patel to Watson, no run","short of a length again, within the stumps, played back to Patel"
1.3,"Axar Patel to Vijay, 1 run","slower, flighted, middle and leg, worked to leg"
1.2,"Axar Patel to Watson, 1 run","again flat and short, punched past square leg for one"
1.1,"Axar Patel to Watson, no run","flat, angling in, punched to mid-on"
0.6,"Rabada to Vijay, 2 runs","final ball strays into the pads, clipped away for a nice couple to deep square leg"
0.5,"Rabada to Vijay, no run","short of a length, rises into the chest, defended off the back foot"
0.4,"Rabada to Vijay, no run","wide length ball, late movement away, beats his attempt at a drive"
0.3,"Rabada to Vijay, no run",another leave outside off as Rabada gets nice shape away from him after pitching
0.2,"Rabada to Vijay, no run","length ball, outside off, slight shape away, left alone"
0.1,"Rabada to Vijay, no run","wide length ball, driven on the toe end to point"
19.6,"Hazlewood to Stoinis, 1 run","across again, an inside edge again, but this just for a single to square leg"
19.5,"Hazlewood to Stoinis, 4 leg byes","lucky runs for Stoinis. Same operation: backing away, then across, Hazlewood bowls a fine yorker wide outside off, and he gets inside edge onto the pad, and then it rolls wide of Dhoni. He could have done better with this"
19.4,"Hazlewood to Stoinis, FOUR runs","lovely shot first ball from Stoinis. He bluffs him twice. First backs away, then shuffles across, and Hazlewood follows him with a slower ball, and he still gets enough bat to beat short fine leg"
19.3,"Hazlewood to Pant, 1 run","wastes a full toss. Surprised by the pace of it, it looks like. Gets just the single to deep midwicket"
19.2,"Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR runs","finally something for him. Hazlewood misses the yorker by inches, and he lofts him back over his head. One bounce into the fence"
19.1,"Hazlewood to Pant, no run","looks for the reverse ramp and is beaten by the offcutter just outside off. Such good bowling, it is forcing them to play new shots"
18.6,"Sam Curran to Iyer, OUT","the frustration has got to Iyer. Lovely over from Curran ends with a reward. Slower offcutter, wide outside off, Iyer just swings for the fences, and gets a thick outside edge. Dhoni dives to his right to take the catch. A highly disappointing innings from Iyer: SR of under 120"
18.5,"Sam Curran to Iyer, 2 runs","nearly a yorker again, he shuffles across to hit this into the leg side for a couple"
18.4,"Sam Curran to Pant, 1 run","short, slower, outside off, hit straight to long-off for another single. Excellent over so far"
18.3,"Sam Curran to Iyer, 1 run","Curran is bowling a great over. After two dots, he bowls wide outside off and full, and has been drilled down to long-off for one. Bowling to his field again"
18.2,"Sam Curran to Iyer, no run","hard length, angling in, hits him high on the bat as he looks to hit down the ground. Two good dots"
18.1,"Sam Curran to Iyer, no run",smart delivery to follow him as he backs away. It stays down to squeeze under his bat
17.6,"Hazlewood to Pant, no run","gets the yorker spot on, well out of his reach, but nowhere close to being a wide. Beats him. Despite two fours, still a good over considering they are just two down"
17.5,"Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR runs",there is Pant. Manufactures a shot. He backs away to make room so he can loft this hard-length ball over cover for four. Lovely shot
17.4,"Hazlewood to Iyer, 1 run","looks at the field, realises this is going to be wide, so he shuffles. But Hazlewood is good enough to execute the yorker. Just the single to third man"
17.3,"Hazlewood to Pant, 1 run","full toss on the pads, and he misses out. Not a full-blooded swipe but a short-arm one for a single to deep midwicket"
17.2,"Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR runs","lots of power in this cover drive. There is a sweeper in place but the man, Kedar Jadhav, is put under pressure and can't keep this in even though he doesn't have too far to run to his left"
17.2,"Hazlewood to Pant, 1 wide",and he stays wide outside off to stay awya from Pant's reach. This time he goes too wide
17.1,"Hazlewood to Pant, no run","starts with a slower ball outside off, and he is beaten on the big shot that he attempts over cover"
16.6,"Chahar to Iyer, 2 runs","sower short ball, wide too, he is out of position, and plays a slap down the wicket and manages to place it between long-on and long-off"
16.5,"Chahar to Iyer, 2 runs",looks for the slog but Chahar follows him with a length ball. Dropped into the leg side for another couple
16.4,"Chahar to Iyer, FOUR runs",full toss on the pads. Yorker gone wrong. This is the break DC need. He plays a short-arm shot between long leg and deep midwicket
16.3,"Chahar to Iyer, 2 runs","yorker, straight, hit into a hole on the leg side for a couple"
16.2,"Chahar to Pant, 1 run","short, into the hip, he gets inside the line to pull it to the right of long leg, but because he is off balance playing the shot, he will get just the single"
16.1,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run","wide length ball, mis-hit to long-off for one"
15.6,"Sam Curran to Iyer, 1 run","goes wide, goes full, protects the over with a shot straight to his sweeper fielder. That's bowling to your field"
15.5,"Sam Curran to Pant, 1 run","yorker, on off, can't do much with it. Gets a single to long-on"
15.4,"Sam Curran to Iyer, 1 run","wide length ball, cutting away, driven away to long-off for one"
15.3,"Sam Curran to Iyer, 2 runs","short of a length, pitched outside leg, bunted into the leg side for another couple"
15.2,"Sam Curran to Pant, 1 run","this is a good yorker, but Pant is good enough to hit this towards fine leg. But he finds short fine leg"
15.1,"Sam Curran to Pant, 4 runs","whoa that is a freebie. A nice slower ball from Curran, patted back to him, but he throws back and throws wide, giving nobody a chance in the field. Sticky hands, I think"
14.6,"Chahar to Iyer, 2 runs","short of a length, straight, bunted into the leg side and they take two to the ball that barely reaches the 30-yard circle"
14.6,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 wide",wide ball as he bowls the bouncer too short
14.5,"Chahar to Pant, 1 run","slower short ball, runs it to short third man for one"
14.4,"Chahar to Pant, FOUR runs","finally breaking free. Gets width on a length ball, and he plays the orthodox classic extra-cover drive to troll those who can't live with his unorthodoxy"
14.3,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run","wide length ball, hit to extra cover for one"
14.2,"Chahar to Pant, 1 run","on a length, outside off, looks to hit hard, but shanks it almost, for a single to cover"
14.1,"Chahar to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover for one"
13.6,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run","on a length, outside off, pushed to cover for one"
13.5,"Jadeja to Pant, 1 run","Pant thinking the big slog again, but the length is a touch too short for it. Punched to long-on for one so well done Jadeja"
13.4,"Jadeja to Pant, no run","shimmies down the wicket, Jadeja fires this into the pads at 96ks, appeals for lbw but it is headed towards leg"
13.3,"Jadeja to Iyer, 1 run","into the pads, single to short fine leg"
13.2,"Jadeja to Pant, 1 run","wider length ball, bunted into the leg side but will get only one"
13.1,"Jadeja to Pant, FOUR runs","that is Pant. That is why love Pant. He sees there is no fielder at fine leg so he goes across, gets on a knee, and sweeps a length ball right to that long leg for four"
12.6,"Chawla to Pant, 1 run",and Pant plays from the crease to end this with a single
12.5,"Chawla to Iyer, 1 run","even quicker, short, he goes back to cut it to deep point"
12.4,"Chawla to Iyer, no run","quick, short of driving length, so he plays it back to Chawla"
12.3,"Chawla to Iyer, no run","on a length, flat, Iyer plays off the back foot, straight to cover"
12.2,"Chawla to Shaw, OUT","down the wicket, beaten in the flight as he drags the length back, the lack of spin means he gets an inside edge onto the pad and the ball rolls to Dhoni's right, who collects and stumps Shaw"
12.1,"Chawla to Pant, 1 run",goes back to punch a length ball to deep midwicket for one
11.6,"Jadeja to Shaw, no run","flatter and quicker, looks for the late-cut again, and is beaten"
11.5,"Jadeja to Shaw, no run","slows it down, within the stumps, short of slogging length, defended back to him"
11.4,"Jadeja to Shaw, FOUR runs",this time he goes one better. Quicker from Jadeja so he can wait for it and late-cut it between point and short third man
11.3,"Jadeja to Shaw, 2 runs","short, rally short, he has the time to do whatever but it is also wide outside off. So he cuts this square of deep cover"
11.2,"Jadeja to Pant, 1 run","stays short of that slogging length, outside off, punched to deep cover"
11.1,"Jadeja to Shaw, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover for one"
10.6,"Chawla to Pant, no run","looks for the big sweep over suqare leg, but is beaten by the googly outside leg again"
10.5,"Chawla to Pant, no run","flat, quick, appeal for lbw as he is trapped on the crease. This is the googly so it is difficult for it to have pitched on and gone on to hit"
10.4,"Chawla to S Dhawan, OUT","he tries the reverse shot and is given out lbw. He is looking to go over the point ring, but he plays it ordinarily. He doesn't sweep it. He is trying to play a reverse shot upright, and it is not easy. Not when Chawla fires in it to trap you plumb"
10.3,"Chawla to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","skips out of his crease, gets close enough to the pitch of the ball, and lofts this back over Chawla's head"
10.2,"Chawla to Shaw, 1 run","flighted around off, drilled to long-off. Just too close to him to get any elevation"
10.1,"Chawla to S Dhawan, 1 run","flat, quick, on off, punched to long-off for one"
9.6,"Jadeja to Shaw, SIX runs","and this is double barrel stuff now. Not just Dhawan but Shaw also getting stuck into Jadeja. Against the spin, not to its pitch, but he sweeps with all his might and hits him for a flat six square on the leg side"
9.5,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run","fired into the pads, pushed to long-on for one"
9.4,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, FOUR runs",and Dhawan shows he is not all slogs. The field might have moved to protect the leg side but Dhawan loves the off side too. He plays the drive over extra cover this time to put Jadeja under further pressure
9.3,"Jadeja to Shaw, 1 run","on a length, middle and leg, holds its line, pushed into the leg side to bring up his first fifty of this season"
9.2,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run","gets the length to sweep, but it is still not full enough so he ends up sending it deep square leg for one"
9.1,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 2 runs",Jadeja risks the pull to deny him the slog. Dhawan goes back to punch this short ball wide of deep midwicket for two
8.6,"Chawla to Shaw, no run",looks to drive on the up but mis-hits it back to CHawla
8.5,"Chawla to Shaw, 2 runs","on a length, middle and leg, turned towards off, can't play the big shot so he bunts this towards long-on and comes back for two"
8.4,"Chawla to Shaw, FOUR runs","terrific batting. Shaw jumps out of the crease, Chawla goes wide on the crease and tries to get him stumped with a wide, but he ends up driving it over extra cover again. Lovely hands"
8.3,"Chawla to Shaw, no run","goes back expecting a short ball, but the late-cut finds the man at point"
8.2,"Chawla to Shaw, FOUR runs","lovely shot. It is a chip over extra cover. Hardly any follow0-through. Just makes room, and takes this really full ball and dunks it over extra cover"
8.1,"Chawla to S Dhawan, 1 run","flighted around off, seems like a googly, he drops this at his toes and takes the single"
7.6,"Jadeja to Shaw, no run","nice dip and some turn. In front of middle and off, played back to Jadeja"
7.5,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run","flatter, shorter, pulled down the ground for one"
7.4,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, FOUR runs","flat slog sweep this time, and he has beaten deep midwicket too. So the spinners hurting CSK second game in a row"
7.3,"Jadeja to Shaw, 1 run","on a length, middle and leg, no turn, worked to leg for one"
7.2,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, 1 run","low full toss, driven to long-on for one"
7.1,"Jadeja to S Dhawan, SIX runs","that last over bought Dhawan a life-line, and now he cashes in on left-arm spin. Right in his slot, and he slogs this over midwicket for six"
6.6,"Chawla to Shaw, FOUR runs","oh those last two punches pushed the sweeper in front of square, and then he rocks back to late-cut this flat delivery through point for four. Much-needed good over for DC"
6.5,"Chawla to Shaw, 2 runs","punched away in front of cover-point again, and this time Chahar makes the ground to keep them down to two"
6.4,"Chawla to Shaw, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Goes back to punch a length ball in front of cover, and Dhoni will not be happy with Chahar's half-hearted attempt at the boundary. Just feebly sticks his foot out. If looks could kill, Dhoni would be under trial right now"
6.3,"Chawla to S Dhawan, 1 run",short of a length - the perfect one for spinners - punched down the ground for one
6.2,"Chawla to Shaw, 1 run","bowl short again, pulled to deep midwicket for another single"
6.1,"Chawla to S Dhawan, 1 run","short quick ball first up, pulled down to long-on for one"
5.6,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","slower bouncer, he aborts the pull and goes for the upper cut. Gets just the single to deep point"
5.5,"Chahar to S Dhawan, no run","slower ball, and pressure builds and builds for Dhawan. He is beaten on the pull, and it somehow bounces over the stumps"
5.4,"Chahar to Shaw, 1 run","yrker. Middle and leg, dug out towards mid-on for a single"
5.3,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 1 run","down the wicket again, but Chahar shortens the length and cramps him up. Dhawan gets just the single into the covers"
5.2,"Chahar to S Dhawan, 2 runs",not the most convincing of shots but Dhawan is away. He drives with an open face and deliberately in the air. He gets a thick edge fine of deep cover for a couple
5.1,"Chahar to Shaw, 1 run","wide on the crease, short of a length, wide, punched away, but the diving cover-point keeps them down to one"
4.6,"Hazlewood to S Dhawan, no run","on a length, middle and leg, headed towards off, played defensively again as he looks for a single that he can't find"
4.5,"Hazlewood to S Dhawan, no run","down the wicket, gets no room or length error from Hazlewwod. Has to play defensively"
4.4,"Hazlewood to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length, ends up just outside off, he opens the face, but can't get it past point"
4.3,"Hazlewood to Shaw, 1 run","short of a length, angling in, punched to leg for one"
4.2,"Hazlewood to Shaw, 2 runs",mis-hit but it has gone past mid-on. Not short enough to pull perhaps or maybe too wide. Yes too wide to be pulling so he ends up lobbing it towards mid-on. But he has got enough meat in it to clear the fielder
4.1,"Hazlewood to Shaw, no run","hit hard on the up, with an open face, but can't beat the wide mid-off"
3.6,"Sam Curran to Shaw, 1 run","picks this up from middle and leg, almost a vertical-bat pull, gets a single to deep square leg"
3.5,"Sam Curran to Shaw, 2 runs","flicked away from middle and off, into the leg side,through square leg. Gets a couple"
3.5,"Sam Curran to Shaw, 1 wide",oh misses out. Plum length ball outside leg with fine leg in the circle. Shaw wants six but can't catch up with it. Wide
3.4,"Sam Curran to Shaw, FOUR runs","he has had enough of failing to find gaps. Stands tall, picks the slower ball, and lofts it over mid-off. Doesn't matter that this is not a driving length. He goes hard at it, and clears the field"
3.3,"Sam Curran to Shaw, no run","noe the cutter away from him, punched on the up but straight to cover"
3.2,"Sam Curran to Shaw, no run","back to regulation swing, and he has smashed this straight to midwicket"
3.1,"Sam Curran to Shaw, FOUR runs",the first poor ball from Curran. Starts too straight with short fine in the circle. He has tried a legcutter here. And he has been flicked away past short fine. Although not sure fine leg should be up when you are swinging into the pads
2.6,"Hazlewood to Shaw, 1 run","driven hard on the up, Hazlewood gets a left hand to it. On the full, but that was hardly a chance as this was hit hard and he was in his follow-through. Mind you, he took one recently in the England series. Jason Roy, was it?"
2.5,"Hazlewood to S Dhawan, 1 run","the first full ball from Hazlewood, swings back into Dhawan, and he gets an inside edge onto the pad but takes the single"
2.4,"Hazlewood to Shaw, 1 run","short of a length again, he gets the width to throw his bat at it, but Jadeja makes a one-handed diving save at point"
2.3,"Hazlewood to S Dhawan, 1 run","short of a length, tucked away off the hip, gets a single to leg"
2.2,"Hazlewood to S Dhawan, no run","short of a length, on the pads, he looks to pull but is beaten and hit on the thigh pad"
2.1,"Hazlewood to S Dhawan, no run","on a length, middle and leg, headed to off, defended, but he won't get the single"
1.6,"Sam Curran to Shaw, no run","bouncer, middle and leg, he ducks it. That is a good over from Curran. Started off well, used swing, and then protected the over with a bouncer last ball"
1.5,"Sam Curran to Shaw, no run","change-up from Curran. After swinging four balls, he has bowled the cutter here. Shaw adjusts well, plays with soft hands, and the edge dies in front of Dhoni"
1.4,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, 1 run","down the wicket, Curran shortens the length, he cuts this in front of deep cover, but a one-handed pick-up and throw from M Vijay keeps them down to one"
1.3,"Sam Curran to S Dhawan, no run","nice swing away from Dhawan, just outside off, left alone"
1.2,"Sam Curran to Shaw, 1 leg bye","swinging back in again, beats the bat this time, but the ball is headed down leg. Gets a leg-bye"
1.1,"Sam Curran to Shaw, no run",looking for that lbw with swing back into the pads. Shaw's bat comes down in time
0.6,"Chahar to Shaw, 1 run","short and wide, he needs a ladder to reach it, but reach it he does and gets a single to deep cover"
0.5,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","short of a length, outside off, Shaw early into the punch, hits this uppishly to mid-off"
0.4,"Chahar to Shaw, FOUR runs","fuller, wider, and this time Shaw goes one better with a lovely drive away from the body with an open face. Finds that save gap between cover-point and extra cover"
0.3,"Chahar to Shaw, FOUR runs","lovely shot. You give him width and shortish length, and he will keep punching you all night long. This one goes in front of cover-point, along the ground, all the way for four"
0.2,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","nice swing away but for some reason, Shaw is beaten on the inside edge. On replays he has actually inside-edged it. Nobody appeals. No sign of disappointment or guilt from Shaw either"
0.1,"Chahar to Shaw, no run","short of a length, wide, swinging away, but Shaw throws his bat it it. Tries to cut, but ends up hitting it to extra cover"
16.6,"Ashwin to Chahal, OUT",that is plumb. Full and at middle stump. Gets down for the sweep and is completely cramped on it. On the back leg right in front of middle stump
16.5,"Ashwin to Steyn, 1 run","googly, skidding in from a good length outside off. Squeezed to deep square off the thick inside edge"
16.4,"Ashwin to Chahal, 1 run","full at off stump, nicely forward to flick this down to long-on"
16.3,"Ashwin to Chahal, no run","googly, sliding into the corridor. Defended off the back foot"
16.3,"Ashwin to Chahal, 1 wide","googly, full and very wide outside off. Left alone"
16.2,"Ashwin to Saini, OUT","takes leg stump. A googly from Ashwin and he shakes his head. That is revenge taken. Perhaps one of his easier ones. Good length ball on off and this one is as rash as the last one was classy. No feet, all hoick"
16.1,"Ashwin to Saini, FOUR runs","oooh, classy. Nice inside-out loft from Saini. Full ball outside off, down on one knee and pure timing as he goes with the turn"
15.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Steyn, no run",big appeal for lbw but he was struck outside off. A good length ball angled in and he was struck playing the forward block
15.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Saini, 1 run","good length on off stump, punched to long-off"
15.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Saini, no run","full on off stump, defended to midwicket's right"
15.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Saini, no run",inside edge onto pad as he looks to blaze a full ball through the covers
15.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Sundar, OUT",not this time. Another miscue from Sundar's many attempts. This is full and the angle is across him. He looks to go leg side with the loft and can only slice it harmlessly for the fielder at long-on. His longest innings in the IPL comes to an end
15.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Sundar, SIX runs","clears long-off! Neat little loft from Sundar, after several attempts to go straight against spin. This is full and outside off, he's got a big stride out and cleared the fielder with ease"
14.6,"Maxwell to Saini, no run","short and pushed across him, beats him on the cut"
14.5,"Maxwell to Sundar, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven to long-off"
14.4,"Maxwell to Sundar, no run","good length at middle stump, pushed with the turn to point off the back foot. Run-out appeal as Sundar scrambles back after taking a few steps. He's grounded though"
14.3,"Maxwell to Sundar, FOUR runs","oh dives over it. Pooran with the shocker in the deep. Short of a length ball angled into him, gentle punch off the back foot. Pooran makes the ground to his right and then it just seep through"
14.2,"Maxwell to Saini, 1 run","good length at middle stump, tapped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
14.1,"Maxwell to Sundar, 1 run","full and in at middle stump, lofted to long-on's right"
13.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Yadav, OUT","into leg stump! Good length, coming in with his regular angle, and also spinning in off the pitch. Umesh shaping for the big slog sweep but is through the shot too soon"
13.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Yadav, no run","good length and angled in outside off, mistimed drive on the up to extra cover"
13.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Sundar, 1 run","back of a length on the stumps, driven down to long-on"
13.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Sundar, no run",appeal for lbw is turned down. Got down for the sweep against this full ball. Might have pitched outside leg
13.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Sundar, 2 runs","short and just outside off, punched to long-off's right"
13.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Sundar, 2 runs","pulled back in by long-on. Full ball outside off, gets the slow sweep over the bowler's head off the low part of the. Two fielders converge but long-on puts in the slide and saves two"
12.6,"Maxwell to Dubey, OUT","bowled him! Skidder from Maxwell, a bit low arm, and angled in from wide of the crease around the wicket. Clears the front leg and looks to whip into the leg side. It's hit his back leg and deflected onto the stumps"
12.5,"Maxwell to Dubey, no run",dropped short and skidding onto his thigh as he gets back to try and pull this
12.4,"Maxwell to Sundar, 1 run",good length and skidding onto middle stump. Steps out and drives to long-on

11.4,"Neesham to Dubey, no run","good length, slower ball outside off. Chopped to point"
11.3,"Neesham to Dubey, SIX runs","carted over midwicket! Whew, that looked sweet! Short and just outside off, stands tall and pulls off the front foot. Flat and clears the boundary with ease"

11.2,"Neesham to Sundar, 1 wide","short and down leg side, left alone"

10.6,"Shami to Dubey, no run","short at off stump, defended to point off the back foot"
10.5,"Shami to Sundar, 1 run","full at middle stump, driven straight and splits the stumps at the other end. Dube was a couple of yards out if Shami had got a hand on that"

10.3,"Shami to Dubey, 1 run","short outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
10.2,"Shami to Sundar, 1 run","short at off stump, dabbed in front of third man with soft hands"
10.1,"Shami to Sundar, FOUR runs","just short of third man! Short ball across him. Looks for the ramp. M Ashwin lunges low to his right and isn't getting there. So he adjusts and has a flap at it so that it doesn't bounce over him. Does it brilliantly, then gives chase and puts in a slide as the ball heads towards fine leg. Pulls it back in but his heel's connected with the boundary as he does so"
9.6,"Neesham to Sundar, 1 run","short at off stump, punched to sweeper"

8.5,"Ashwin to Dubey, no run",good length and just outside off. Punched into the covers
8.4,"Ashwin to Sundar, 1 run",good length and turning in at off stump. Waits on that and nudges to point
8.3,"Ashwin to Sundar, no run","short of a length outside off, punched straight to extra cover"
8.2,"Ashwin to AB, OUT","Sarfaraz takes it at sweeper cover! Full and wide outside off, looks to drill this over the off side, but there's no elevation, it's flat and taken some ten yards inside the rope. Ashwin is thrilled, so is Sarfaraz"
8.1,"Ashwin to AB, FOUR runs","oh unlucky at sweeper cover. Good length ball outside off, absolutely smoked on the rise past extra cover. Sarfaraz sprints and puts in the dive to his right to get to it. Just manages to get away from him because of the momentum"
7.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Sundar, no run","full outside off, driven along the floor to extra cover"
7.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Finch, OUT","has he bowled him? Or is it caught behind? Looks good for both. It is bowled. Short of a length, skidding onwards and clipping the top of off as Finch exposes middle and off to try and play the cut. Nice, quick readjustments from the young bowler after that nervous first over"
7.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Finch, 2 runs","short of a length at leg stump, clipped to short fine's left"
7.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to AB, 1 run","tossed up outside off, watches closely before driving out to sweeper cover"

6.4,"Ashwin to Finch, 1 leg bye","full on leg stump, looks to flick but cops that on the pad"

6.1,"Ashwin to Finch, FOUR runs","full and down leg side, gets low and whips this past short fine leg"
5.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to AB, no run",good length ball sliding in towards off stump. Hurriedly chopped to cover point
5.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to AB, FOUR runs","full and into the pads. Allows it on and tickles it fine, using Bishnoi's pace. Cottrell gives chase and drags it in, but was in contact with the boundary padding as he did so"
5.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to AB, no run",good length and sliding in at off stump. Watchfully defended into the covers
5.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to AB, no run","full on leg stump, flicked straight to short midwicket"

5.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Finch, FOUR runs",back away and swats it over the bowler. Goes short again and follows him again. But there is room for him to just get this wide of mid-off now
5.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Finch, 1 wide",follows him down leg side with a short ball as Finch backs away a long way. A bit too much on it
4.6,"Cottrell to AB, 2 runs","full slower ball outside off, looks to get low and crunch it wide of mid-off. It comes off the toe end"
4.6,"Cottrell to AB, 1 wide","dropped too short this time. Way, way over the batsman's head"
4.5,"Cottrell to AB, no run","rapped on the bicep. Short ball in the corridor, was looking to pull that. Catches it on the right arm"
4.4,"Cottrell to AB, no run","good length at middle stump, defended down the pitch"
4.3,"Cottrell to AB, FOUR runs",slashed through the covers. Too short from Cottrell. And a bit of width. Weight onto the back foot and quick hands to hit well in front of square
4.3,"Cottrell to AB, 1 wide","full slower ball, very wide outside off, left alone"
4.2,"Cottrell to AB, SIX runs","oh wow, unreal. Casually launches this over the long-off boundary. It's short of a good length and a slower ball. He's just held a strong base, waited on it, and swung on the up from a fully static position. Incredible"
4.1,"Cottrell to AB, no run","can't get that away. Short and just outside off, punched off the back foot, straight to extra cover"
3.6,"Shami to Finch, no run",good length and honing in at middle stump. Forced to defend this on the front foot
3.5,"Shami to Finch, no run","that could be out caught behind. Finch reviews. Short of a good length ball pinning him back. It went through to the keeper off the back leg. But there were two sounds. Was it bat or did the ball hit the front flap before hitting the thigh? Yes, UltraEdge confirms it was the front knee flap that made the sound. On lbw it is not out. Wickets missing. Good review from Finch after being given out."
3.4,"Shami to Finch, FOUR runs","drilled over mid-on. Attempted slower ball turns into a friendly full toss. Merely has to clear the infield and does it, no fuss"
3.3,"Shami to Finch, no run","length on middle stump, flicked from deep in the crease to short midwicket"
3.2,"Shami to AB, 1 run","good length and just outside off, off his feet to try and tap this into the covers. Gets an inside edge onto body"
3.1,"Shami to Finch, 1 run","length on off stump, tapped to mid-off from deep in the crease"
2.6,"Cottrell to AB, no run",short and up at the chest. Watchfully defended into the leg side
2.5,"Cottrell to Finch, 1 run","short and just outside off, opens the face and runs it to third man"
2.4,"Cottrell to Kohli, OUT",taken at mid-on! RCB falling apart! Short and pushed across him outside off. Looks for the pull and slices it straight up for Bishnoi who sets up and watches and watches and watches before taking it calmly
2.3,"Cottrell to Kohli, no run","good length at middle stump, back in the crease and punches it to the bowler"
2.2,"Cottrell to Kohli, no run","good length, slower ball at off stump. Looks to tap it into the covers but it rolls back down the pitch"
2.1,"Cottrell to Kohli, no run",rapped in the mid-riff as he looks to pull. Short ball up at off stump as he looks to go behind square
1.6,"Shami to Finch, no run",beaten on the pull. Short and in the corridor. Plays on top of the bounce
1.5,"Shami to Finch, no run","short of a good length just outside off. Finch walks down at him again, but this time he lets it go"
1.4,"Shami to Kohli, 1 run","short of a good length, climbing up at his hips. Shuffles and drops it behind square with soft hands"
1.3,"Shami to Philippe, OUT","given lbw and he won't review! Trapped right in front of middle. Philippe is used to batting in powerplays, but this experiment has failed. Jumps into the off side and looks to whip a straight, good length ball behind square. Pinned right in front"
1.2,"Shami to Finch, 1 leg bye",short and at leg stump. Walks down at it and drags it out to fine leg
1.1,"Shami to Finch, no run","big appeal for lbw, it appears. Pins Finch deep in the crease with a good length ball. Raps the top of his knee flap at a leg stump line. Not out"
0.6,"Cottrell to Philippe, no run",past the outside edge. Full and floated away outside off. Shuffles and looks to drive but is swishing inside the line as this goes straight on
0.5,"Cottrell to Philippe, no run",good length and swung in at off stump. Defended down the pitch
0.4,"Cottrell to Padikkal, OUT","taken at mid-on! Out comes the salute! Follows him down leg side and cramps him at the chest with a short ball. Backing away looking for the pull, but this is onto him quickly. Slices it up for the fielder"
0.3,"Cottrell to Finch, 1 run",inside edge past the stumps. Good length and hooping into the corridor as he looks to cut. Rolls out towards square leg
0.2,"Cottrell to Finch, no run",inswinging yorker at middle stump. Keeps the feet out of the way and jams it down into the pitch
0.1,"Cottrell to Padikkal, 1 run","full outswinger at off stump, jammed out to mid-off"
19.6,"Dubey to Rahul, SIX runs",he bowls the short offbreak and gives up six anyway! He was waiting for it. Back and across on off stump. Right in his swinging arc and he swung it straight over the bowler. The highest score by an Indian in the IPL
19.5,"Dubey to Rahul, SIX runs","pumped over wide long-on! KXIP have 200. Driving length, floated up at leg stump. Front leg out of the way and a clean swing"
19.4,"Dubey to Rahul, FOUR runs","carved behind point. Full and some width outside off, once again he just stays deep in the crease and opens the face on this"
19.3,"Dubey to Nair, 1 run","low full toss outside off, looks to go inside-out over extra but can't time this too well. Just a single to sweeper's right"
19.2,"Dubey to Nair, FOUR runs","swatted to the backward square fence. Walks down at him, pre-meditated. It's a short ball, but he's not quick enough to bother Nair who swivels a touch and sends this on its way"
19.1,"Dubey to Nair, 2 runs","full and just outside off, lofted over the bowler and between the two deep fielders at the straight boundary"
18.6,"Steyn to Rahul, FOUR runs","inside edge and it's boundary number four at fine leg on the night. Another Short of a good length ball. Kept a touch low, this one. Rahul was looking for the pull and the inside edge sprinted past the stumps"
18.5,"Steyn to Rahul, SIX runs","scythed over extra cover. What a shot. 140kph from Steyn, but driving length outside off. Rahul's waiting deep in the crease and merely opens the face after chopping down at this with an angled bat"
18.4,"Steyn to Rahul, SIX runs","second tier! 95 metres. Wow. All a bit predictable from RCB right now. Slower ball slammed in short of a good length. Rahul waits on this one and pummels this pull shot, far far over midwicket"
18.3,"Steyn to Rahul, no run","good length and sliding outside off, beaten on the slash"
18.2,"Steyn to Rahul, FOUR runs","first century of the 2020 season! KL Rahul carves this full ball over short third man to bring up his second IPL hundred. It's not been entirelyfluent, especially as he's tired on a slowing pitch on a big ground, but he'd done the groundwork early on and with some reprieves, he's the man who's there at the end. Keeping the runs ticking for his team and reaping the rewards now. This will mean so much to the man who said he was anxious he might not be able to play cover drives thanks to the lockdown"
18.1,"Steyn to Rahul, SIX runs","just clears AB at deep square. Slower ball, good length at leg stump. Waits on it and rolls the wrists. This time it goes square like he wants it to. AB leaps backwards, one-handed after running to his right. Gets a hand on it too, but it was already beyond him"
17.6,"Saini to Rahul, 1 run","Kohli drops one again! Much more straightforward this time. Full slower ball, looks to drill that over long-off and loses his shape and his timing. Floats up for Kohli who has to run a straight path, gets under it, and then simply cannot hold on"
17.5,"Saini to Rahul, FOUR runs",carves between backward point and short third. Fifth offcutter in a row. Short and wide this time. Deliberately chopped behind by Rahul
17.4,"Saini to Nair, 1 run","offcutter, short of a good length outside off. Backs awalefty and slices to sweeper's"
17.3,"Saini to Nair, FOUR runs","ramped past short fine. A step into the leg, then into the off side. Classic Karun Nair. Saini attempts another offcutter, it's a full toss and he jabs at this late and gets the bat in the right position"
17.2,"Saini to Rahul, 1 run",good length offcutter on leg stump again. Shoveled to deep square off the front foot
17.1,"Saini to Rahul, no run","offcutter, good length and outside off. Looks to lace it through the covers, chops it into the pitch"
16.6,"Steyn to Rahul, 1 run","Kohli drops him at deep midwicket! Full toss on leg stump, wanted to use the pace to angle that over the square boundary. But it ended up only slightly to Kohli's right at deep midwicket. He couldn't get completely under it, was looking to catch that a bit to his right, away from his eyeline. And he grabbed at it a bit too soon"
16.5,"Steyn to Rahul, SIX runs","clears deep midwicket. Just. That was hit hard. Offcutter dug into the surface again, dropped short and sitting up for the pull. Slugs it flat and clears Kohli. It's only into the ad board there, but that is an 87 metre hit."
16.5,"Steyn to Rahul, 1 wide","full and floated wide outside off. Slipped out, that one, left alone"
16.4,"Steyn to Rahul, 2 runs","nails the yorker at middle and off, jammed down the long-on's left"

15.3,"Dubey to Nair, 1 run","good length on middle stump, punched on the up to long-on"
15.2,"Dubey to Maxwell, OUT","slapped to extra cover! Oh boy. Offcutter, slammed into the pitch, short and outside off. Steps out and it sits up sweetly for a lashing. and he's lashed it straight to Finch"
15.1,"Dubey to Maxwell, 2 runs","short ball just outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
14.6,"Chahal to Rahul, no run","good length outside off, gets forward and pats it down the pitch"
14.5,"Chahal to Maxwell, 1 run","tossed up full on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
14.4,"Chahal to Rahul, 1 run",
14.3,"Chahal to Rahul, FOUR runs","swept to the backward square boundary again. Chahal clearly has a plan to keep it at Rahul's legs, but this is the second time he's made use of it. Gets low and gets it well to deep square's right"
14.2,"Chahal to Rahul, no run",leading edge trickles safely to extra cover. Length ball dipping at leg stump and he closes the face early on it
14.1,"Chahal to Rahul, 2 runs","tossed up full outside off, gets forward and slices to sweeper's right"
13.6,"Dubey to Rahul, 1 run",good length and sliding into the corridor. Tapped on the up to long-on
13.5,"Dubey to Maxwell, 1 run","good length outside off, pulled to deep midwicket off the toe end"
13.4,"Dubey to Rahul, 1 run","good length at middle stump, tapped into the leg side off the back foot"
13.3,"Dubey to Maxwell, 1 run",dropped at mid-off. Negi flying to his right and can't hang on to a difficult chance. But this is the exact shot that Maxwell fell to last match - trying to drive on the rise and getting through it too early
13.2,"Dubey to Maxwell, no run","good length outside off, beaten on the drive"
13.1,"Dubey to Pooran, OUT","hits it straight to mid-off! Dube's dream IPL 2020 with the ball could become an actual thing here. Gentle good length ball just outside off, steps out and sort of yorks himself - or cramps himself for sure. Can't get the swing through it to go right of or over ABD. Hit its knee height"
12.6,"Saini to Rahul, FOUR runs","in control this time as he lofts it over extra cover. His second cover drive against Saini. Taken to his pace, it appears. Good length and outside off. He has to go on the rise, which is ideal if you want to go aerial. Good shape as he executes this"
12.5,"Saini to Rahul, FOUR runs",top edge and clear of the keeper. Caught a little on the front foot here as a short one rises up at the helmet. Adjusts quickly and swipes from under it
12.4,"Saini to Pooran, 1 run","short at the ribs, dragged to fine leg's left with a pull"
12.3,"Saini to Pooran, no run","good length at leg stump, flicked straight to midwicket"
12.2,"Saini to Rahul, 1 run","good length at off stump, punched on the up to mid-off's right"
12.1,"Saini to Rahul, 4 leg byes",shoveled fine past the keeper. This must be Rahul's third boundary at fine leg tonight. Good length ball angled into his pads and he turns it away
11.6,"Sundar to Rahul, 1 run","dropped short of a good length, 101.6kph in the corridor. Mistimed punch down towards long-on off the back foot"
11.5,"Sundar to Pooran, 1 run","length and slanted in at the stumps. Clears the front leg and goes for the big slog, but, miscues another one to deep midwicket. Sundar is sliding them on rapidly"
11.4,"Sundar to Rahul, 1 run","good length, sliding on outside off. Backs and slces to sweeper cover"
11.3,"Sundar to Pooran, 1 run","short at the stumps, mistimed pull rolls down to long-on's left"
11.2,"Sundar to Pooran, no run","good length at the stumps, hurriedly pushed into the covers"
11.1,"Sundar to Rahul, 1 run","good length at middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot and that is fifty number one for the season for KXIP's new captain"
10.6,"Chahal to Pooran, no run","good length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
10.5,"Chahal to Rahul, 1 run",good length and just outside off. Dropped to extra cover's left with soft hands

10.1,"Chahal to Rahul, no run","short of a good length and turning away, cut straight to backward point"
9.6,"Yadav to Rahul, 1 run","good length at off stump, looks to work it into the off side. It ends up pitch side on the leg off the inside half"
9.5,"Yadav to Rahul, FOUR runs",tickled fine. Umesh struggling once more through the middle. Good length and onto the pads. Hangs deep and gets enough bat on that
9.4,"Yadav to Rahul, no run","slower ball at a good length, slides under the bat as Rahul looks to drive on the rise"
9.3,"Yadav to Rahul, SIX runs","carved over deep extra cover. Overpitched outside off, hangs deep in the crease and stays leg side of that. Front leg hanging in the air as it gets into the leg side too. And then he just opens the face at the perfect moment"
9.3,"Yadav to Rahul, (no ball) 2 byes",no-ball as this slips out of Umesh's hands and sails out towards fine leg. Completely lost that
9.2,"Yadav to Pooran, 1 run","short at the hips, clipped to deep square's right"
9.1,"Yadav to Pooran, FOUR runs","crunched past mid-off. Overpitched and a bit of width outside off. Nice pace on that for Pooran to get forward, open his arm and hit through the line"
9.1,"Yadav to Pooran, 1 wide","slower ball, short and down leg side. Looks to play the pull and gets an edge that doesn't carry to the keeper"
8.6,"Chahal to Pooran, 1 run","another slider, good length and at off stump. Front leg moves rapidly into the leg side to make room as he chops this to sweeper cover"
8.5,"Chahal to Rahul, 1 run",length and sliding onto leg stump. Punched to long-on from deep in the crease
8.4,"Chahal to Pooran, 1 run","full on off stump, driven to long-off along the floor"
8.3,"Chahal to Pooran, 2 runs","full outside off, a slider this time. Nicely on top of that and flicks to deep midwicket's right"
8.2,"Chahal to Pooran, no run","big appeal for lbw is turned down. Another googly. He's looking to sweep him but that's probably pitched outside leg stump. No, replays show it pitched in line! But there might have been an edge"
8.1,"Chahal to Pooran, no run","short of a good length, turning in at off stump. Punched to extra cover off the back foot"
7.6,"Sundar to Rahul, no run","good length outside off, looks to flick to long-on but can't beat the bowler"

7.2,"Sundar to Rahul, 1 run","short outside off, chopped to sweeper cover"
7.1,"Sundar to Rahul, FOUR runs","through Steyn's legs at short third. Short and just outside off, sliced straight to Steyn who is down with the barrier, but it's a barrier with a massive hole"
6.6,"Chahal to Agarwal, OUT","gets him with the googly! Makes India's Test opener look bang average with yet another perfect googly for the season. Mayank looking to drive through the covers on the up, for a good length ball pitching on off. Massive gap between bat and pad. He had no inkling of this. Loses middle and off. Chahal doesn't normally bowl too many googlies to right handers, but he has nailed them this season so far"
6.5,"Chahal to Rahul, 1 run",slows it down further and this time Rahul drops it pitch side with soft hands. Loopy and drawing him forward outside off. Direct hit at the non-striker's end but Rahul is well safe
6.4,"Chahal to Rahul, no run","slows it down, good length on off. Watchfully tapped into the covers off the front foot"
6.3,"Chahal to Rahul, FOUR runs","swiped to the backward square boundary. This will be a good match-up. Chahal goes quick and full, but at leg stump. Rahul is down quickly and it's a pristine shot, along the floor"
6.2,"Chahal to Agarwal, 1 run","good length and just outside off. Hangs deep in the crease and shapes for the cut, but it doesn't turn too much. Pokes into the covers"
6.1,"Chahal to Rahul, 1 run","dropped short at off stump, punched to sweeper cover"
5.6,"Saini to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball, good length at 105.kph. Hard hands on the push and a thick inside edge to deep square's right"
5.5,"Saini to Agarwal, 1 run","short of a length in the corridor, opens the face and runs it tp third man"
5.4,"Saini to Agarwal, FOUR runs",full toss outside off and he just pats that through extra cover like he's in training
5.4,"Saini to Agarwal, 1 wide","good length, poor line. Attempted slower ball. About 40kph slower than regular pace at 106kph. Bounces down leg side"
5.3,"Saini to Agarwal, no run",beaten. Bouncer just outside off at 147.9kph. He's already under it and wants to ramp it over third man
5.3,"Saini to Agarwal, 1 wide",good take down leg side. Short ball following Mayank down leg side. A long long way down leg side. He can't get bat on the pull. Philippe is nearly parallel to the floor as he grabs this
5.2,"Saini to Agarwal, no run","146.7kph, full and in at off stump. Late on the attempted drive and he gets an inside edge to short fine"
5.1,"Saini to Rahul, 1 run","slower ball at a good length, gets forward and inside edge onto pad for the single in the off side"

4.4,"Steyn to Agarwal, no run","short of a good length, at off stump and providing no room. Defended to backward point off the back foot"
4.3,"Steyn to Agarwal, FOUR runs","just clears midwicket and then teases mid-on who can't win the race. Short of a good length, drags this pull shot a tad. It was another slower ball. The bat turned in his hand, but these are the benefits of being a batsman in the powerplay"
4.2,"Steyn to Rahul, 1 run","another slower ball, full and onto the pads. Flicked to deep square"
4.1,"Steyn to Agarwal, 1 run",offcutter at a length on leg stump. Awkward little chip towards deep square after he commits early to the flick
3.6,"Saini to Rahul, no run","length at off stump, hurried onto him this time and he taps it down the pitch"
3.5,"Saini to Rahul, FOUR runs","oh yes! Yes yes yes. That is the KL Rahul everyone dreams of for India. This is full and outside off, and he brings out the perfect cover drive - big stride, weight into the shot, high elbow and a balanced head right on top of the ball. Perfect timing on it"
3.4,"Saini to Rahul, 2 runs","short of a length just outside off, 137.5kph. Allows that to skid on and stays on the back foot before deflecting to third man's right"
3.3,"Saini to Agarwal, 1 run","low full toss, 142.7kph, hurriedly tapped to mid-on's left"
3.2,"Saini to Agarwal, no run","beaten by pace on the flick. Full and skidding onto the front pad, just outside the line of leg stump, as he looks to flick. 144.7kph"
3.1,"Saini to Agarwal, no run","good length and just outside off, just a little late on the cover drive. That slams into the bat. 144.1kph"
2.6,"Yadav to Rahul, no run","full slower ball outside off, drifts away from him in the corridor. Defended to point"
2.5,"Yadav to Rahul, no run","good length at leg stump, flicks it straight to short fine. Was running down the pitch too and had to be sent back. Close call as Steyn took aim but couldn't hit the stumps"
2.4,"Yadav to Agarwal, 1 run","length on off stump, punched off the front foot and an early call for the single at mid-off"
2.3,"Yadav to Agarwal, FOUR runs","sweet timing this time. Full and onto the pads again, is Umesh, and Mayank leans in to get his weight into the shot. Keeps the face full offered and clips it late to midwicket's left"
2.2,"Yadav to Agarwal, no run","short of a length outside off, punched on the up to cover"
2.1,"Yadav to Agarwal, FOUR runs",forced over extra cover off the toe-end of the bat.  Walks into and slightly legside of this good length ball to make room. Opens the face but it doesn't come off the middle. Has enough to beat Finch from mid-off
1.6,"Steyn to Rahul, no run",a sound as he's beaten on the hook. Turned down by Chaudhary and not contested by RCB. Short ball rose steeply at his front shoulder. He got inside the line but was off balance and bit too far away from it to connect properly
1.5,"Steyn to Rahul, no run","slower ball, short and wide again. A more forceful cut this time but straight to backward point"
1.4,"Steyn to Rahul, FOUR runs","chopped away this time and beats Umesh at third man. Similar length again from Steyn, short enough for him to rock back and chop into the turf. Umesh does well to get to the ball but it trickles through after he tumbles and gets a hand on it to his right"
1.3,"Steyn to Rahul, FOUR runs","threads it through! Top class. Just short of a good length from Steyn and he is back, on his toes, and opens the face late to punch this between cover point and backward point"
1.2,"Steyn to Rahul, no run",good length and just outside off. Solidly behind that to defend into the covers
1.1,"Steyn to Agarwal, 1 run",short of a good length with some shape away. Opens the face and steers to third man
0.6,"Yadav to Rahul, FOUR runs",oh back down leg side. Nearly the perfect over from Umesh until this length ball slanted into the pad. Stays tall in the crease and tickles it fine
0.5,"Yadav to Rahul, no run",short of a good length and cramping him at the waist. Forced to defend into the off side
0.4,"Yadav to Agarwal, 1 run","short at the hips, off his feet to tuck this down to fine leg"
0.3,"Yadav to Agarwal, 2 runs",misfield in the covers. Full outswinger and he leans back and check-punches this. Sundar lets it through despite a slide to his right
0.2,"Yadav to Rahul, 1 run",good length and shaped away from middle. Closes the face and nudges it to mid-on
0.1,"Yadav to Rahul, no run",good length and a nice curve away in the corridor. Defended off the back foot
19.6,"Chahar to Shivam Mavi, OUT","and he ends up with a wicket last ball. Mavi wants to hit a six, Chahar shortens his length and beats him to leave him stranded halfway down the wicket"
19.5,"Chahar to Shivam Mavi, 2 runs","tossed up wide, driven to deep cover for two"
19.4,"Chahar to Kuldeep, 1 run","full and straight, pushed down the ground for one"
19.3,"Chahar to Kuldeep, no run","Yadav tries the reverse sweep, and is beaten outside off"
19.2,"Chahar to Shivam Mavi, 1 run","short, but no power behind the pull. Gets a single to deep midwicket"
19.1,"Chahar to Shivam Mavi, no run",cut away to point
18.6,"Pattinson to Shivam Mavi, 1 run","slower ball, right in the slot, but he doesn't hit him in the air. Takes a single to long-on"
18.5,"Pattinson to Shivam Mavi, no run","wide length ball, hit hard but straight to point"
18.4,"Pattinson to Shivam Mavi, no run",bottom edge as he makes room to try to cut
18.3,"Pattinson to Shivam Mavi, no run","slower ball, Mavi well early into the shot. Beaten"
18.2,"Pattinson to Cummins, OUT","oh he has hit better balls than this for sixes. This is right in the slot, it is on-pace, and he is thinking six as he swings hard, but gets the toe end of the bat for an easy catch to midwicket"
18.2,"Pattinson to Cummins, 1 wide","Cummins backs away, Pattinson looks to go wide, but bowls too wide"
18.1,"Pattinson to Shivam Mavi, 1 run","short of a length, slower, pushed to point for one"
17.6,"Bumrah to Cummins, SIX runs",wow. Bumrah goes for 27 in one over. All too late of course but still. Bumrah bowls another low full toss. He is looking for a wicket instead of closing it out. Cummins backs away and hits him back over his head
17.6,"Bumrah to Cummins, 1 wide",tries to follow him a slower ball but bowls a wide down the leg side
17.5,"Bumrah to Cummins, SIX runs","six number three off a Bumrah over. He gets the yorker wrong, and Cummins slogs this over midwicket. Just clears him"
17.4,"Bumrah to Cummins, 2 runs","goes for the yorker, driven in front of sweeper cover for two"
17.3,"Bumrah to Cummins, SIX runs","six more for Cummins. He is getting some of his own back here. He is not in control of this one for sure. Bumrah bounces him, and follows him, and he gets a top edge on the hook that sails over long leg"
17.2,"Bumrah to Cummins, no run","dug in shorter, Cummins backs away again, looks to pull, beaten"
17.1,"Bumrah to Cummins, SIX runs","lovely shot. Short of a length, into the body, and he backs away to help this along, using his pace to send it over long leg for a six"
16.6,"Boult to Shivam Mavi, FOUR runs","Mavi, who bowled well earlier, stands tall to help this short ball along to deep square leg for four"
16.5,"Boult to Cummins, 1 run","full,nearly a yorker, dug out to mid-off for one"
16.4,"Boult to Cummins, FOUR runs",Cummins gets four back. Backs away to a shortish ball and slaps it over mid-off
16.3,"Boult to Naik, OUT","short ball, over his shoulder, top-edges the hook, easy catch for deep midwicket. Mumbai looking to end this early now"
16.2,"Boult to Naik, no run","slower ball, around off, fullish, driven to cover"
16.1,"Boult to Cummins, 1 run","follows him with a full ball, concedes just the single off the inside edge"
15.6,"Bumrah to Cummins, 1 run","full, outside off, driven with an open face, gets a single to deep cover"
15.5,"Bumrah to Cummins, no run","full and straight, defended to midwicket"
15.4,"Bumrah to Morgan, OUT","and Bumrah has one more. Morgan backs away to try to hit over mid-off, but he is too good for him with the slower offcutter and takes the outside edge through to the keeper"
15.3,"Bumrah to Morgan, no run","wide on the crease, angled across hi, short of a length, hits the bottom edge"
15.2,"Bumrah to Naik, 1 run","on a length, outside off, dropped into the covers for one"
15.1,"Bumrah to Russell, OUT","he knocks back his leg stump and stands there still, no emotion. It is in the slot, but Russell is done by the pace. His bat comes down late, and this should seal Mumbai's first win in six attempts in UAE"
14.6,"Boult to Morgan, no run","slower short ball again, and Morgan is beaten. Excellent bowling from Mumbai this evening. They have their plans in place, and have executed them perfectly"
14.5,"Boult to Russell, 1 run","slower ball, not full enough for his slog, and he ends up drilling it to long-on for one"
14.4,"Boult to Russell, FOUR runs","big wind-up, big swing, to a length ball outside off, and he gets a thick outside edge over the short third man for four"
14.3,"Boult to Russell, no run","slower short ball, loopily passes by his shoulder, and he decides to not have a go at it"
14.2,"Boult to Russell, FOUR runs","full toss outside off, Russell's first boundary as he drives this past the diving extra cover"
14.1,"Boult to Morgan, 1 run","full and straight, hit to long-on for one"
13.6,"Pattinson to Russell, no run","good sharp bouncer, and Russell wants nothing of it. Ducks under it"
13.5,"Pattinson to Morgan, 1 run",goes back to bowling wide outside off. Would have been wide had he not hit this to deep cover for one
13.4,"Pattinson to Morgan, SIX runs","Morgan's first six. This time he stands his ground, and gets under a length ball to loft him over midwicket. More height than distance but still gets enough of it"
13.3,"Pattinson to Morgan, no run","sees him back away, and slips in a wide delivery outside off. Beaten"
13.2,"Pattinson to Russell, 1 run","short, no room, Russell backs away, doesn't get power behind it. Just the single to long-off"
13.1,"Pattinson to Russell, no run","in the slot, outside off, but he fails to make a perfect connection. Mid-off fields"
12.6,"Bumrah to Morgan, no run","another sharp short ball, this time beats his top edge on the pull"
12.5,"Bumrah to Morgan, no run","it has hit the stumps but the bail has not fallen off. A quick short ball, has got him in the ribs, and then it rolls into the base of the leg stump. Not hard enough to remove the bail"
12.4,"Bumrah to Russell, 1 run","big wind-up as he backs away, Russell follows him, cramps him up, gives away only a single"
12.3,"Bumrah to Russell, 2 leg byes","slower ball, follows him, hits the pads, and goes for two leg-byes"
12.2,"Bumrah to Russell, no run","no sighters here. He backs away to hit a length ball back, and Bumrah fields in his follow-through and threatens to throw it back too. All action"
12.1,"Bumrah to Morgan, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length, steered to third man for one"
11.6,"Pollard to Morgan, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to long-off for one"
11.5,"Pollard to Morgan, no run","slower ball outside off, squeezes under Morgan's drive"
11.4,"Pollard to Rana, OUT","lovely catch by H Pandya. Pollard's slowness means Rana has to create all the power on this lofted cover drive. Pandya is off the fence and he has to run back to hold on and he has to keep the fence in mind too. He does all that, and makes it look easy. Pollard's first IPL wicket since 2015"
11.3,"Pollard to Morgan, 1 run","moves wide to cover the line, Pollard gives him no pace to work with. Hit to long-on for one"
11.2,"Pollard to Morgan, no run","slower ball, right in the slot for Morgan, but he misses out on the straight hit. Just the front leg taking him away from the line of the ball there"
11.1,"Pollard to Morgan, FOUR runs","short, wide, legcutter, cut away for four, past the man at point"
10.6,"Chahar to Morgan, 1 run","full, outside off, driven to long-off. Breaks the maiden. What an over"
10.5,"Chahar to Morgan, no run",tentative push at one pushed through outside off. Beaten
10.4,"Chahar to Morgan, no run",tries the reverse sweep but is beaten
10.3,"Chahar to Morgan, no run","lovely bowling. For a moment I thought he had bowled him. Slow, drifting away, crates the gap between bat and pad, and then turns back to hit him on the pad. Just outside the line"
10.2,"Chahar to Morgan, no run","on a length, outside off, legbreak, he goes back to cut it, but straight to point"
10.1,"Chahar to Karthik, OUT","plumb. Karthik is feeling the pressure, and as soon as he sees one flighted up, he gets down for a slog sweep. It dips nicely to beat him, and goes straight on to hit him dead in front"
9.6,"Pollard to Karthik, 1 run","wide on the crease, short, but Karthik has no pace to work with. So his pull shot fetches them only a single. Great over: six singles and a wide"
9.5,"Pollard to Rana, 1 run","slower ball again, and Rana has to abort the big shot. Gets a single to deep cover"
9.4,"Pollard to Karthik, 1 run",slower ball again. Not giving him any room. Worked to leg for one
9.3,"Pollard to Rana, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, punched to deep cover"
9.2,"Pollard to Karthik, 1 run","full, outside off, driven down to long-off for one"
9.1,"Pollard to Rana, 1 run","short of a length, wide, cut away for a single"
9.1,"Pollard to Rana, 1 wide","short of a length, outside leg, called a wide"
8.6,"Krunal to Karthik, no run","well bowled, dipping, on a length, no room. Pushed back to him"
8.5,"Krunal to Rana, 1 run","closer to the stumps, but flat to deny him the slog. Hit down to long-on for one"
8.4,"Krunal to Rana, FOUR runs","oh he bowls wide outside off to avoid that slog weep, but Rana is not that one-dimensional. He plays the cover drive to take four on the off side. Effortless batting"
8.3,"Krunal to Karthik, 1 run","pushed through, on a length, punched down to long-off for one"
8.2,"Krunal to Karthik, FOUR runs","full and wide, and he opens the face with the drive to beat the man at deep cover. Lovely awareness of the field, and execution to go with it"
8.1,"Krunal to Karthik, no run","back of a length, slow, Karthik hits this hard to extra cover"
7.6,"Chahar to Karthik, 1 run","bowls this short, and Karthik pulls it for a single to deep square leg"
7.5,"Chahar to Rana, 1 run",another reverse sweep but this time he finds the short third man
7.4,"Chahar to Rana, FOUR runs","reverse sweep now. Switches early, takes this from outside what would have been his leg stump, and beats who would have been short third man"
7.3,"Chahar to Rana, 2 runs","flat, on a length, punched wide of deep cover for a couple"
7.2,"Chahar to Karthik, 1 run","quicker, flatter bunts this into the leg side"
7.1,"Chahar to Karthik, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Karthik plays spin well. Gets to the pitch of this flighted delivery, and lofts him inside out over extra cover for four"
6.6,"Pollard to Karthik, 1 run","slower ball again, cut away for a single"
6.5,"Pollard to Rana, 1 run","on the pads, and worked away for a single"
6.4,"Pollard to Rana, no run","short, wide, Rana looks for the cut, gets a bottom edge"
6.3,"Pollard to Karthik, 1 run","slow again, on a length, on the pads, worked to leg"
6.2,"Pollard to Karthik, FOUR runs","lucky there. Slower ball, short outside off, Karthik cuts hard, gets a top edge, but it somehow goes wide of short third man"
6.1,"Pollard to Rana, 1 run","on the pads, worked away into the leg side for one"
5.6,"Chahar to Rana, 1 run","quicker, flatter, pulled away to deep square for one"
5.5,"Chahar to Rana, no run","swept away nicely but finds the man at short fine. A couple of metres either side, and it is four"
5.4,"Chahar to Rana, no run","quicker, flatter, gets an inside edge, but it misses the stumps"
5.3,"Chahar to Rana, SIX runs","Rana into the act. He has picked the googly, gone down on a knee, and smashed this over long-off for a six. Lovely shot"
5.2,"Chahar to Rana, no run","on a length, middle and leg, defended to leg"
5.1,"Chahar to Karthik, 1 run","on a length, on the pads, nudged to short fine for one"
4.6,"Pattinson to Rana, no run","full, straight, defended back to him"
4.5,"Pattinson to Narine, OUT","nice one-handed grab by de Kock. Narine's poor record against Mumbai continues. He makes room to try to pull. Pattinson sticks with the plan: short, at his body. The top edge is flying over de Kock's head, but he leaps with perfect timing and grabs this with the right mitt"
4.4,"Pattinson to Karthik, 1 run","short of a length, straight, dropped into the leg side for one"
4.3,"Pattinson to Karthik, no run","looks for the pull but this one skids through and stays a touch low, beating hi and hitting him on the box"
4.2,"Pattinson to Karthik, FOUR runs","short of a length, wide, and he smashes this with an open face. In front of point it goes for four"
4.1,"Pattinson to Narine, 1 run","and it nearly gets him Narine's wicket. Short, outside leg, cramping him, hitting the sticker on the bat, but there is no man at short square leg to accept this lob"
3.6,"Bumrah to Karthik, no run","short of a length, outside off, defended off the back foot"
3.5,"Bumrah to Karthik, no run",good carry from just short of a length outside off. Left alone by Karthik
3.4,"Bumrah to Karthik, no run","Narine survives another run-out. Karthik hits this to midwicket, and Narine strolls up the wicket despite calls of NO. Pollard, though, misses with the throw from midwicket"
3.3,"Bumrah to Narine, 1 run","misses the run-out. The short ball to follow him, draws a top edge into the body. Karthik calls him through for a single. Narine is late to start is out by streets if Bumrah hits. Bumrah misses"
3.2,"Bumrah to Narine, no run","short of a length, cramping him up, but he manages to punch it powerfully. But straight to cover-point"
3.1,"Bumrah to Narine, no run","Bumrah starts off with a quick length ball angling across. Narine's feet don't move, and he is beaten on the drive"
2.6,"Boult to Karthik, FOUR runs","sweetly timed. Slightly too full, and he drives on the walk, between mid-off and extra cover. All intent"
2.5,"Boult to Karthik, no run","on a length, outside off, push-driven on the up, but can't beat the man at point. Looks in good touch"
2.4,"Boult to Gill, OUT","Boult goes short now, and Gill has pulled this straight to midwicket. He is deep in the crease to pull this but the mistake he makes is to try to pull it down. From that height it is a long way down. Had he looked for a six, who knows he might have got away with it"
2.3,"Boult to Gill, FOUR runs","Narine breaks free. Doesn't bother about finding the gap. He just hits it so hard, on top of its bounce, into the ground that it bounces over the infield on the off side. Boult makes the mistake of giving him room"
2.2,"Boult to Gill, no run","fuller, closer to off, respectfully played back to Boult"
2.1,"Boult to Gill, 2 runs","on a length, outside off. Looks for the big hit down the ground, get an inside edge fine of fine leg for a couple"
1.6,"Pattinson to Narine, no run","short, quick, Narine looks to make room and hit it down the ground. Mis-hits it back to Pattinson"
1.5,"Pattinson to Narine, SIX runs","slower ball, too full, on the pads, and even though they have a man deep on the leg side, he can only watch this sail over for a six"
1.4,"Pattinson to Gill, 1 run","full, into the pads, pushed wide of mid-on for one"
1.3,"Pattinson to Narine, 1 run","short again, Narine makes room to hit this back down the ground. Pattinson gets a hand to it, which allows them to take a single off the deflection"
1.2,"Pattinson to Narine, no run",nice punch from Narine but can't beat H Pandya at point. Pattinson staying short
1.1,"Pattinson to Narine, no run",weird shot from Narine. He looks to duck a short ball but sees it has not come off the surface and lets it hit him softly
0.6,"Boult to Gill, no run","lovely end to the over. Not short, just short of a length, and it pitches on leg and seams away to beat his edge"
0.5,"Boult to Gill, no run","full, outside off, timed sweetly, but hit straight to mid-off"
0.4,"Boult to Gill, no run","on a length, outside off, skiddy, hits his bottom edge as he opens the face"
0.3,"Boult to Gill, no run","on a length, around off, slight seam away, crunched square on the off side, but can't beat point"
0.2,"Boult to Gill, no run","length ball, just outside off, left alone"
0.1,"Boult to Gill, no run","full, really full, dug out just outside off"
19.6,"Shivam Mavi to Pollard, 2 runs",Mavi bluffs him. Bowls the short ball. Pollard pulls it down towards deep midwicket where a misfield lets them come back for two. Still a good last over
19.5,"Shivam Mavi to Pollard, 2 runs","diving save at extra cover by Morgan, but the deflection to long-off allows them time to come back for two. Not the perfect yorker, but wide enough to deny Pollard a free swing"
19.4,"Shivam Mavi to Pollard, 2 runs","wide on the crease, short slower ball, mis-hit into the leg side, Pollard calls for two immediately and makes it. Karthik is not happy with the effort in the deep"
19.3,"Shivam Mavi to Pollard, FOUR runs","this full toss has gone wrong. Not low, not wide. High and straight with a straight field, allowing him a free hit square on the leg side"
19.3,"Shivam Mavi to Pollard, 1 wide","and he does that, and Mavi beats Pollard, and Karthik appeals only to see it has been called a wide. He reviews it immediately. The replay shows no edge, but the ball is only just wide of that guide line, and Pollard is standing outside his off stump. so slightly harsh on that wide call"
19.2,"Shivam Mavi to Krunal, 1 leg bye","slower ball to Pandya, beats him as he slogs, concedes just the leg-bye"
19.1,"Shivam Mavi to Pollard, 1 run",low full toss with the long-off and long-on very straight. Good plan. Just the single to long-off
18.6,"Russell to Krunal, no run","another sharp quick bouncer, beats his attempt to pull. Russell has bowled an excellent over here. Could be the difference between a win and a loss"
18.5,"Russell to Pollard, 1 run","doesn't get power in this, just the single to deep cover"
18.4,"Russell to Krunal, 1 run","on his backside at the striker's end, and lying prone at the non-striker's. What a delivery for Krunal. Sharp bouncer from Russell, hits his glove, and the force of it knocks Pandya down. Only to realise Pollard is pushing him for the quick single. And he has to dive at the non-striker's end to make it"
18.3,"Russell to Pandya, OUT","he is hit wicket. Goes deep to counter the yorker and shuffles to the off stump, but loses the whereabouts of his stumps. Russell delivers the yorker, which Pandya wants to steer, but as the bat comes down, it knocks off the off bail"
18.2,"Russell to Pollard, 1 run","Russell stays wide, Pollard looks to go over wide long-off, but is hit on the inside half of the bat. Single to long-off"
18.1,"Russell to Pandya, 1 run","full and wide, drilled down to long-off for one"
17.6,"Shivam Mavi to Pandya, 1 run","low full toss again, drilled down to long-on for one"
17.5,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, OUT","Sharma has looked exhausted for a while now. Usually you would see such a full toss outside off disappear into the grand stand, but he ends up slogging this to long-on for an easy catch. Not the worst thing to happen for Mumbai"
17.4,"Shivam Mavi to Pandya, 1 run","slower short ball, slapped down to long-off for one"
17.3,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","full, wide again, hit in front of cover, and they still take just the single. This time Pandya has said no to the second"
17.3,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","This has been called a wide. Sharma has shuffled across, which is why he goes wider, and while it looks really wide, it has gone under Sharma's bat. KKR not happy with the call"
17.2,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","short ball, mis-hits the pull, but he has managed to place this square of deep midwicket for four. He is early into the shot here"
17.1,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","wide full toss, mis-hit down the ground, but places it wide of long-off for a couple"
17.1,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","tries the slower ball, and it lands off the cut strip. The umpires are wondering if this should be a wide or a no-ball. If it lands off the pitch, it is a no-ball, but this is called a wide after discussion between the two umpires"
16.6,"Cummins to Pandya, SIX runs","the best of the three pulls. Pandya is showing his worth here. He knows Cummins is going to bowl back of a length and cramp him up so he goes deep in his crease and shuffles to get inside the line of it, and short-arms it over deep midwicket for six this time. Amazing hitting"
16.5,"Cummins to Pandya, no run","quicker, sharper short ball, following him too, and Pandya has to get out of its way"
16.4,"Cummins to Pandya, FOUR runs","and he keeps beating those two men on the leg side. Another short-arm pull off a ball that is not short enough. Again bisects those two men on the leg side, and hits the rope on the half-volley"
16.3,"Cummins to Pandya, FOUR runs","short of a length, Pandya goes deep into the crease to manufacture the length to pull, and bisects deep backward square and deep midwicket"
16.3,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, 2 wide","Sharma backs away far, Cummins tries to follow him but overdoes it for a leg-side wide. Karthik allows a bye too as this bounces in front of him"
16.2,"Cummins to Pandya, 1 run","outside edge as he looks to work a wide length ball to leg, the throw from short third man hits Sharma's right foot. It is a strong throw as well. And he was a goner had Rana's throw hit the wicket"
16.1,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","that is how hard lengths work. Sharma tries to play the pull, gets a massive top edge, but it lands safe around the 30-yard circle around square leg"
16.1,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","slower ball, down the leg side, wide"
15.6,"Narine to Pandya, no run","another carrom ball, short of a length, outside off, pushed to cover, who is tight on the single. Narine ends beautifully"
15.5,"Narine to Pandya, no run","quicker delivery, 95ks, turns back in sharply, hits him on the pad again"
15.4,"Narine to Pandya, no run","lovely delivery, dipping and turning back in, hitting the pad but headed down leg"
15.3,"Narine to Pandya, no run","carrom ball, full on off, Pandya gets a sighter and defends"
15.2,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short ball, pulled between deep square and deep midwicket, but they don't come back for two. Is Rohit gassed?"
15.1,"Narine to Tiwary, OUT","carrom ball from Narine, Tiwary is looking to go over long-off, and is early into the shot too, getting a lot of height but no distance on it. Perfect time for Pollard or Pandya to walk in. Tiwary has done his job"
14.6,"Cummins to Tiwary, 1 run","again slower, hard length, pitched outside leg, cutting towards middle, worked to leg for one"
14.5,"Cummins to Tiwary, 2 runs","slower ball again, on a length, on the pads, nudged past short fine for a couple"
14.4,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","Sharma sets up for the ramp, Cummins bowls the slower one, which means he can't send it over fine leg. The ball goes much squarer, and gets him just the single"
14.3,"Cummins to Tiwary, 1 run","looks to make room, Cummins bowls a slower one short of a length, and he has to adjust and get just the single to point"
14.2,"Cummins to Tiwary, SIX runs","Tiwary is taking Cummins to the cleaners. The plan is to bowl hard lengths again, and Tiwary is equal to it. Stays back, opens the front leg, and lofts this over mid-on"
14.1,"Cummins to Tiwary, FOUR runs","looks for the hard length with mid-on and mid-off up. Tiwary still manages to drive it back down the ground, and between the two. Not the best timing but enough on it"
13.6,"Kuldeep to Tiwary, 1 run","tossed up outside off, Tiwary sets up for a slog-sweep, gets a bottom edge to leg for one"
13.6,"Kuldeep to Tiwary, 1 wide","angled too far across, called wide"
13.5,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","quicker, nearly seam-up, 106ks, Sharma winds up again, but is late into it, and gets just the single off the inside edge"
13.4,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","lovely shot. Sharma has picked his bowler. Skips down the track, right to the pitch of this, and lofts it over long-on for his 200th IPL six"
13.3,"Kuldeep to Tiwary, 1 run","angling across him, turning further away, punched to deep cover"
13.2,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","tossed up, full, Sharma winds uo for a big one, but he gets this too full. Sharma can't get under this. Gets just the single to long-on"
13.1,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","starts off with a loose ball. Defensive. Short here, looking to dart one in. Sharma pulls this up and over midwicket. These are not short boundaries so it takes a clean hit"
12.6,"Sandeep to Tiwary, 2 runs","tries a straight yorker, Tiwary opens up the front leg and squeezes this past square leg for a couple"
12.5,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",tries a big shot but only manages a toe end for a single. The wide line means Sharma has to reach for it. Warrier stays with his plan to bowl away from Sharma's reach
12.4,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","Sharma moves around in the crease, but Warrier sticks with his area and hits the inside edge of his bat"
12.4,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","tries a wide slower ball this, and has been called for it"
12.3,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","slower ball? It does move away from him after angling in. So might have been a slower legcutter. Beats Rohit's loft outside off, and falls in short of Karthik"
12.2,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","stays wide again, and this time Sharma has a go at it, and lofts him in front of deep cover for four"
12.2,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide",short and wide outside off. Sharma doesn't have to play at it
12.1,"Sandeep to Tiwary, 1 run","quick length ball, driven on the up, wide of mid-off, gets a single"
11.6,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","another sweep, and again not in control. Kuldeep keeps the length just short of what is ideal for sweeping, and draws a top edge. A fifty nonetheless for Rohit"
11.5,"Kuldeep to Tiwary, 1 run","angles this across him, wide, punched to deep cover for one"
11.4,"Kuldeep to Tiwary, no run","on a length, looks to run this behind square, can only send it to point"
11.3,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","nice length, not in the arc, not short, can only work it to leg for one"
11.2,"Kuldeep to Tiwary, 1 run","regulation legbreak, short of a length, punched down to long-off for one"
11.1,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 leg bye","acrobatic work from Katthik behind the wicket. Deflection off Sharma's pad as he tries the sweep, and Karthik has covered it well with his body but can't prevent one leg-bye"
10.6,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","Narine continues with his comeback. Just the single.Three overs without a boundary now. This is a carrom ball, short of a length, and is punched down to long-on for one"
10.5,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, 1 run, OUT","skips down the track, Narine drags the length back, beats him in flight, and he drops this into the leg side. Lovely chase from Narine and a lovely take from Morgan. Narine chases towards deep midwicket, they decide to take him on, the throw comes in quick to the bowler's end, but on a half-volley. Morgan gathers it beautifully, and flicks the bails off behind him. A wicketkeeper would be proud of that work"
10.4,"Narine to Yadav, 1 run","another carrom ball, hit down the ground for a single"
10.3,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",swept away to long leg
10.2,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, no run","fired into the pads, 92ks, draws a dot. Carrom ball that beats him with the drift more than the turn and hits the pads"
10.1,"Narine to Yadav, 1 run","nice dip on this, not in the swinging arc, so he pushes it down to long-on"
9.6,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","nice legbreak, around off, turning back in, on a length, defended back to him"
9.5,"Kuldeep to Yadav, 1 run",drilled down to long-off for one
9.4,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",premeditates a sweep and wastes a juicy foll toss on the pads. Gets a single to long leg
9.3,"Kuldeep to Yadav, 1 run","mis-hits the free hit, getting a top edge on the slog to a low full toss. Gets just the single"
9.3,"Kuldeep to Yadav, (no ball)","that's really quick, 106ks, and he has beaten him on the late cut. Almost a seam-up delivery. But it is a no-ball"
9.2,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","sweeps this from just outside off, along the ground to deep square"
9.1,"Kuldeep to Yadav, 1 run","Surya leaves the crease again, Kuldeep cramps him up, and the mis-hit falls well short of long-on"
8.6,"Narine to Yadav, 1 run","stays short, away from the swinging arc, punched down to long-on for one. Good comeback from Narine"
8.5,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, 1 run",offbreak. Short of a length. Turns in appreciably. Worked to leg for one

7.6,"Kuldeep to Yadav, 1 run","on a length, outside off, goes back to punch this to deep midwicket for one"
7.5,"Kuldeep to Yadav, SIX runs","lovely shot. He has picked the wrong'un. Steps down, gets to its pitch, and has gone inside-out over cover for a six. Nothing more alpha than picking a googly and going with the turn and hitting a six"
7.4,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","nice turn back in, slightly quicker too, it runs off the inside half of Sharma's bat for one"
7.3,"Kuldeep to Yadav, 1 run",drags the length back. Gets some dip. Punched to midwicket for one
7.2,"Kuldeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","flighted high again, driven to long-off again"
7.1,"Kuldeep to Yadav, 1 run","slow and loopy first up, driven to long-off for one"
6.6,"Russell to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","full and wide, driven in front of sweeper-cover for two"
6.5,"Russell to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","there is no mistiming this. A gentle short ball at the stumps, and Sharma has smoked this out of the stadium. Sweet sound of the bat. Th sixes stats of Abu Dhabi already getting a working over"
6.4,"Russell to Rohit Sharma, no run","short of a length, wide, looks to punch it away, gets a bottom edge"
6.3,"Russell to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs",that is the first pull he has mis-hit this evening as Russell follows him and hurries him up a little. And still he has managed to place it in front of long leg for four
6.2,"Russell to Rohit Sharma, no run","on a length, on off, pushed back to Russell"
6.1,"Russell to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, opens the face late to get a single to third man"

5.5,"Narine to Yadav, 1 run","short again, punched to deep midwicket"
5.4,"Narine to Yadav, FOUR runs","drags the length back, and Yadav loves it just as much. Stands tall and pulls him over midwicket"
5.3,"Narine to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","slow through the air again, offbreak on middle and leg, pushed to long-on for one"
5.2,"Narine to Yadav, 1 run","slows this down, gets some dip on it, Yadav can't hit this so he nudges it to leg for one"
5.1,"Narine to Yadav, FOUR runs","a nothing offbreak loosener to start off with but Yadav is in no mood for sighters. Plays the pick-up shot over midwicket, thank you very much"
4.6,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run","full ball, some shape, hits the outside half of the bat as he looks to work this to leg"
4.5,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs",that is a small six but still worth 6. Quick to see a short ball but doesn't bother rocking back and pulls it from the crease over midwicket. It lands just beyond the rope
4.4,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, no run","Sharma looks to make room, but Cummins follows him, drawing a defensive shot back"
4.3,"Cummins to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length, on off, manages to work this to leg"
4.2,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","short of a length, no room, worked to leg for one"
4.1,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","well he doesn't miss out this time. Short ball on an easy-paced pitch, and he is waiting for it. Pulls this 138ks ball over midwicket for six"
4.1,"Cummins to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide",and he starts off with a wide down the leg side. Sharma won't be happy he has missed out. This could have been pulled for a six
3.6,"Shivam Mavi to Yadav, 2 runs","lovely shot. Wrists and forearms. Short of a length, no room to swing his arms, but he punches it nicely past midwicket. Another West Indian, Narine, gives it a slow chase but this time they stay with two"
3.5,"Shivam Mavi to Yadav, no run","on a length, angling in, pushed to midwicket"
3.4,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, 3 runs","fuller this time, he eases himself into another push-drive past mid-off and Russell gives it a ginger chase. Then pulls out te old back heel to keep this in. Has conceded one extra run"

3.2,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, no run","on a length, just outside off, defended to leg"
3.1,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, 2 runs","full, outside off, just a push wide of mid-off for a couple. Elegantly played"
2.6,"Sandeep to Yadav, FOUR runs","slips through the hands of midwicket. He shuffles across to pick this perfectly decent off-side delivery into the leg side. Narine goes up for it, but doesn't seem to have times his jump perfectly"
2.5,"Sandeep to Yadav, FOUR runs","lovely drive to thread the heavily populated cover field. Between cover and cover-point, along the ground. And he has played it on the up too. Top notch"
2.4,"Sandeep to Yadav, FOUR runs","wide on the crease, angling it into the pads, and Yadav loves it there. Plays a clip square on the leg side to beat long leg"
2.3,"Sandeep to Yadav, no run","square drive to a wide length ball, but again straight to the man at point"
2.2,"Sandeep to Yadav, no run",he has missed a plum full toss Just some late swing to do him in. Just outside off so he is okay
2.1,"Sandeep to Yadav, FOUR runs","nearly played on. He looks to cut one outside off, but it is perhaps not short enough. He gets a bottom edge for four to fine leg"
1.6,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, no run",looks for an open-face push-drive but can't get it past the man at point. A wicket-maiden for Mavi. Great start
1.5,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, no run",beaten on the inside edge this time as this wide length ball seams back in and moves dramatically after passing the stumps
1.4,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, no run",left alone outside off as he stays away from his driving arc
1.3,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit Sharma, no run","on a length, angling in, clipped away straight to midwicket"
1.2,"Shivam Mavi to de Kock, OUT",De Kock goes. He tries the big pull shot but the ball is not that short. He has had a big go at this as is evident from high the ball has gone. Nikhil Naik at midwicket has to wait for an eternity for it to come down but catches it comfortably
1.1,"Shivam Mavi to de Kock, no run","short of a length, pitches leg, angles to off, played back to him"
0.6,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs","that extra ball has hurt Warrier. He bowls short and wide, and Sharma loves it, upper-cutting it over cover-point for a six. Warrier screams into his hand towel for having ruined what had been such a good first over"
0.6,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide","goes wide on the crease to vary things a bit, and ends up bowling a wide down the leg side"
0.5,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","gets the width to play the cut, but can't beat the man at point"
0.4,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run","short of a length, tight on off again, played with an open face to point"
0.3,"Sandeep to Rohit Sharma, no run",another defensive shot from Rohit as he stays tight around off

19.6,"Tom Curran to Dhoni, 1 run","slower short ball, cut away to deep cover for one"
19.5,"Tom Curran to Dhoni, SIX runs","quick bouncer, and Dhoni has a hat-trick of sixes. Pulls this over deep square leg. Equal-highest sixes for an IPL match"
19.4,"Tom Curran to Dhoni, SIX runs","somebody return the ball please. Slower legcutter, Dhoni on a knee, sweet connection, new balls please somebody"
19.3,"Tom Curran to Dhoni, SIX runs","and Dhoni finally shows intent. Plays the pick-up to an on-pace length ball, and sends it sailing over midwicket for another six"
19.2,"Tom Curran to Jadeja, 1 run","quick, on a length, outside off, gets a single"
19.1,"Tom Curran to Dhoni, 1 run",pulled to deep midwicket for another single
18.6,"Archer to Jadeja, no run",and he shows he has learnt from his master. A leave to end the 19th over. Dropping his wrists out of the way like proper Test match cricket
18.5,"Archer to du Plessis, OUT","du Plessis woke the sleeping giant up. Archer bowls the quick bouncer this time, and it is too quick for him. Top edge onto his body, and lobs up for a simple catch for Samson. One thing du Plessis has done through this innings: announce that he can hit clean when he wants to"
18.4,"Archer to du Plessis, SIX runs","du Plessis is waiting for a fourth slower ball in the over, and Archer serves it up. He opens up the front leg and pulls this over deep midwicket for another six"
18.3,"Archer to Dhoni, 1 run","slower short ball again, pulled to deep square for one"
18.2,"Archer to du Plessis, 1 run","slower legcutter again, hit inside-out to deep cover for one. Archer bowling to his field"

17.6,"Tom Curran to du Plessis, 1 run","slower short ball again, and there is deep midwicket in place to keep this pull down to one"
17.5,"Tom Curran to Dhoni, 1 run","slower short ball, Dhoni pulls, gets just the single"
17.4,"Tom Curran to du Plessis, 1 run","short of a length, off-pace, he goes inside out, but gets just the single to wide long-off"
17.3,"Tom Curran to du Plessis, no run","yorker, dug out straight to short fine leg. Good comeback from Curran, following him with the yorker"
17.2,"Tom Curran to du Plessis, SIX runs","du Plessis is in some kind of zone. This is as good as Samson's hitting. Curran bowls on-pace, and he clears his front leg to send this length ball over long-off for his fifth straight scoring shot that is a six"
17.1,"Tom Curran to Dhoni, 1 run",punched to deep cover for one
16.6,"Unadkat to du Plessis, SIX runs","and there it is. With a lovely straight six, he goes to 55 off 29, but even that strike rate is not good enough after his slow start pushed CSK into a corner"
16.5,"Unadkat to du Plessis, SIX runs","sets himself up for the short slower ball this time, and pulls this sweetly over midwicket for a six"
16.4,"Unadkat to Dhoni, 1 run","on a length angling in, pushed away for a single"
16.3,"Unadkat to du Plessis, 1 run","Unadkat stays slow, but shortens the length this time. Du Plessis can manage just a single off the pull"
16.2,"Unadkat to du Plessis, SIX runs","down the wicket, banking on a slower one, Unadkat serves one up, and he lofts it over wide long-on for a six"
16.1,"Unadkat to Dhoni, 1 run",hits this on the up but straight to long-off
15.6,"Archer to Dhoni, 1 run","wide length ball, squeezed out for a single"
15.5,"Archer to Dhoni, no run","loopy bouncer, Dhoni leaves it alone, and it is not called a wide. Seemed a wide to me. Well above his head"
15.4,"Archer to Dhoni, no run","bottom edge on the pull, and Samson collects it on the bounce"
15.3,"Archer to du Plessis, 1 run","cramps him up with a short ball, a limp pulls manages to just clear midwicket. Miller thinks about diving, but decides it is too far out of his reach"
15.2,"Archer to du Plessis, FOUR runs","lovely shot. Short of a length, slow, on off, and he backs away to crunch this between cover and extra cover. Finds that gap perfectly"
15.1,"Archer to du Plessis, no run","slower ball, outside off, and du Plessis finds the man at point. Six feet either side, and it might have been four"
15.1,"Archer to du Plessis, 1 wide","looks to follow him, and Archer goes too far down leg"
14.6,"Tewatia to du Plessis, 1 run",front-of-the-hand quick low full toss. Hit to deep cover for one. Tewatia ends with 3 for 37
14.5,"Tewatia to du Plessis, SIX runs","finally du Plessis gets the timing. Tewatia hasn't done much wrong, but du Plessis goes deep and makes room to loft a length ball over long-on. Perhaps needs to be a touch shorter?"
14.4,"Tewatia to Dhoni, 1 run",punched down to long-on for one
14.3,"Tewatia to du Plessis, 1 run","short of a length, no room, punched down to long-on"
14.2,"Tewatia to du Plessis, SIX runs","dropped by Riyan Parag at long-on. Du Plessis still struggling for timing on this small ground. Parag sets himself under it at long-on, and the ball swerves away at the last moment. Du Plessis's first boundary"
14.1,"Tewatia to Dhoni, 1 run","slider into the pads, worked to leg for one"
13.6,"Tom Curran to Dhoni, 1 run","short of a length, slower ball, punched to midwicket, where a misfield gets CSK a single"
13.5,"Tom Curran to Dhoni, no run","slower ball to start off with, Dhoni crunches this hard but straight to extra cover"
13.4,"Tom Curran to Jadhav, OUT","when it is your evening, it is your night. Now Samson takes an amazing one-handed catch to send Jadhav back. Slower short ball, offcutter, Jadhav throws his bat at it, gets a top edge, and Samson leaps to his right to pluck a one-hander"
13.3,"Tom Curran to du Plessis, 1 run",and du Plessis is not getting any power into his hits. Really struggling. Gets a free hit right in the slot but sends it only as far as long-on
13.3,"Tom Curran to Jadhav, (no ball) 1 run","down the wicket, but this slower full toss is so high that it is still called a no-ball"

12.1,"Unadkat to Jadhav, 1 run","full and wide, nearly a yorker, dug out for one"
11.6,"Gopal to Jadhav, 1 run","drilled down to long-off for one. CSK have had their best over in a while, but it has only stayed abreast with the asking rate. Gopal is done for the night"
11.5,"Gopal to du Plessis, 1 run",moves across to pull this length ball to deep square leg for one
11.4,"Gopal to Jadhav, 1 run","Gopal continues to slow it down. Now he has the extra cover back, and Jadhav takes a single"
11.3,"Gopal to Jadhav, FOUR runs",lovely shot. Jadhav gets under a length ball and goes inside-out over cover for four
11.2,"Gopal to Jadhav, FOUR runs","Gopal slows it down, Jadhav looks to go over cover, ends up slicing it over the infield, but the placement is good as the sweeper is too straight"

10.1,"Tewatia to du Plessis, 1 run","full, straight, du Plessis not looking to take risk. So the hat-trick ball is avoided easily. They get a single to long-on"

9.5,"Gopal to du Plessis, 1 run",down the wicket to drive this to long-off for one

8.6,"Tewatia to Gaikwad, OUT","and Tewatia is on a hat-trick. Another stumping for Samson. Gaikwad skips out first ball, Tewatia bowls wide outside off to beat him easily. Tewatia is elated. Celebrates with fingers in his ear. Not sure if he had been given some lip when he was batting"
8.5,"Tewatia to Sam Curran, OUT","and Tewatia has done for Curran. Too many risks he is taking, and has jumped of the crease again. Tewatia slows it down further, and goes wider to beat him. Easy stumping for Samson. Curran goes for a six-ball 17, a very Curran score"
8.4,"Tewatia to Sam Curran, no run","shorter quicker slider, hit back to Tewatia off the back foot"
8.3,"Tewatia to Sam Curran, SIX runs","twice as nice. Tewatia does better than the last time by taking this slightly out of Curran's reach, but he still gets enough on this straight loft to add six more"
8.2,"Tewatia to Sam Curran, SIX runs","lovely shot. Sweet timing. Down the wicket, right to its pitch, and lofts it clean back over his head. over the roof again. New balls please"

7.5,"Gopal to Sam Curran, 1 run","no turn again, Curran goes back to punch this to leg for one"
7.4,"Gopal to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","and he smacks a cool boundary first up. Gopal bowls short again, and he goes back to pull this over midwicket"
7.3,"Gopal to Vijay, OUT","a sleepy little knock from Vijay comes to an end. He has hit in the air for a second time without the conviction of hitting a six. He looks to pull this slightly short ball, but goes only as far as deep square leg"
7.2,"Gopal to du Plessis, 1 run","Gopal gets a hand on this drive back at him, but the deflection goes past the stumps for a single"
7.1,"Gopal to du Plessis, no run","a better start to this over. he tosses it up outside off, and Faf plays it back to him. Surprised by no turn perhaps"

6.5,"Tewatia to du Plessis, 1 run","full, straight, driven to long-on for one"
6.4,"Tewatia to Watson, OUT","timber. Tewatia gets the wicket to ease off some pressure. Watson knows they can't have three singles in a row. He goes back to pull another slider, and this is perhaps not short enough. It squeezes under the bat, hits the pad, and cannons into the leg stump"

6.2,"Tewatia to Watson, 1 run","full, just outside off, driven to long-off for one"
6.1,"Tewatia to Vijay, 1 run","and he nearly has a wicket first ball. Vijay has played a switched-off shot first ball, chipping this towards long-off without any power. It is good he hasn't hit it well: it doesn't carry to the fielder"
5.6,"Tom Curran to Watson, no run","slower ball to end the over, and another dot as it is driven straight to cover"
5.5,"Tom Curran to Watson, FOUR runs","lovely batting. Short of a length, just the amount of width he needs, and he steers this wide of short third man"
5.4,"Tom Curran to Watson, SIX runs","Watson repeats the dose. Curran stays short again, this time on off, and Watson likes this short boundaries. Smoked clean over square leg"
5.3,"Tom Curran to Watson, SIX runs","Watson helps this over the fence. Curran looks to tuck him up, but goes too fa down leg with this shortish ball, and Watson pulls this over long leg"
5.2,"Tom Curran to Vijay, 1 leg bye","short of a length, quick, beats his attempt to play to leg. Goes for a leg-bye"
5.1,"Tom Curran to Vijay, no run",lovely slower ball first up. Vijay totally flummoxed and beaten outside off
4.6,"Gopal to Watson, SIX runs","too short, and Watson sends it over the grandstand. Gopal has found no turn on the ball,and the length has been generally shot. Watson i waiting for this one, and pulls it in the air over square leg"

4.2,"Gopal to Vijay, FOUR runs","short again, no turn, and this time Vijay beats the man at square for four"
4.1,"Gopal to Vijay, no run","not sure this is the wrong'un, but this does come back in. Can't beat square leg"
3.6,"Archer to Watson, no run",quick short ball. Too good for Watson. No room. He has to defend this back to Archer. Just the six runs off the over despite conceding a six off the first ball. The asking rate nearing two a ball already
3.5,"Archer to Watson, no run","slower ball now, and pretty accurate. Watson plays it out watchfully"
3.4,"Archer to Watson, no run","hurried on the pull this time, straight to midwicket"
3.3,"Archer to Watson, no run","looks to run this down, and sends it straight to the keeper. On the bouncer"
3.2,"Archer to Watson, no run","pace on this one, and it draws an lbw shout. Not given, sounds like bat, but the two noises are two pads. Watson simply late on this high pace of Archer. Probably headed down leg. Umpire's call says the replay"
3.1,"Archer to Watson, SIX runs","and he bowls a gentle length ball into the pads. Watson picks the slower ball, and goes over midwicket for a six. They will need many more of these"
2.6,"Unadkat to Vijay, no run","short of a length, on pace, pushed to cover-point. Good comeback by Unadkat after conceding two fours off the first two balls"
2.5,"Unadkat to Watson, 1 run",Watson slogs this slower ball to deep forward square leg for one
2.5,"Unadkat to Watson, 1 wide","slower bouncer, but too high, and it is called a wide"
2.4,"Unadkat to Watson, no run",slower ball again. It is not easy to bowl these with the new ball. Watson pushes this to cover-point
2.3,"Unadkat to Vijay, 1 run","slower ball now, and Vijay has to drop and run. He is not the quick Vijay we knew. He is nearly run out but Tewatia misses with the throw"
2.2,"Unadkat to Vijay, FOUR runs","lovely strike. Clears the front leg, stands tall, and smashes this length ball over mid-off. Has the pace to work with"
2.1,"Unadkat to Vijay, FOUR runs","loose ball. Pitches well outside leg, on a length, and Vijay helps it on its way to fine leg for four"
1.6,"Archer to Vijay, 1 run","short of a length, into the ribs, played with the bottom hand off the bat, gets a single to long leg"
1.5,"Archer to Watson, 1 run","short of a length, just outside off, dropped square of point for a single"
1.4,"Archer to Watson, no run","slower ball? Yes it is. At 123ks. On a length, on off, Watson has to defend"
1.3,"Archer to Vijay, 1 run","short of a length, outside off, steered down to third man for one"
1.2,"Archer to Vijay, no run","wide and full, slower than the last one, driven square, but can't beat Miller at cover-point"
1.1,"Archer to Vijay, no run",that's quick. He has visibly beaten Vijay for pace and hit his pad. Headed down leg
0.6,"Unadkat to Vijay, 1 run","slower ball, on off, he pushes it to point and takes off for a suicidal run. Sent back, and he gets an overthrow for his efforts"

0.1,"Unadkat to Vijay, 1 run","full and straight, dug out for a single to leg"
19.6,"Ngidi to Archer, 1 run","slow and short and wide again, Archer toe-ends this to long-off for another single. Ngidi comes back well to end with just 30 off this over"
19.5,"Ngidi to Tom Curran, 1 run","slower short ball again, outside off, Curran slaps this down to long-off to give Archer another hit before this innings ends"
19.4,"Ngidi to Archer, 1 run","slow and short, into the ribs, cramps him up, just a single to long leg"
19.3,"Ngidi to Archer, no run","slower short ball wide outside off, Archer goes across, is right behind its line, but is early into his swing. Finally a clean dot for Ngidi"
19.3,"Ngidi to Archer, 1 wide",make it 27 off two legal deliveries. He beats Archer with a slower ball but it is called wide. So the free hit remains
19.3,"Ngidi to Archer, (no ball) SIX runs","Make it four. Range hitting at its best. Archer goes deep into the crease, sets up a strong base, and murders another length ball. This one is straight back over his head. Twenty-five off three legal deliveries. Make it 26 off two legal deliveries as this is another no-ball. Man this game is cruel. Another free hit coming up"
19.3,"Ngidi to Archer, (no ball) SIX runs","That is three in a row. Holly Molly. Short of a length, and he makes room again to send this flat over cow corner for another six. Plus this is a no-ball. A big no-ball. CSK losing the plot here"
19.2,"Ngidi to Archer, SIX runs","bang. Over the roof behind midwicket. Ngidi bowls on-pace short ball. Archer clears the front leg, and smacks this over midwicket, and onto the road somewhere"
19.1,"Ngidi to Archer, SIX runs","or as easy as Archer is making it look with this effortless six. Cool as. Ngidi misses his yorker, and he makes room and lofts him back over his head"
18.6,"Sam Curran to Archer, 1 run","full, middle and leg, hit to long-on for one"
18.5,"Sam Curran to Tom Curran, 1 run","walks down at him, Sam shortens the length, pulled away to square leg for a single"
18.4,"Sam Curran to Tom Curran, 2 runs","low full toss, drilled back at him. Sam gets a hand on it. They take Jadeja on for a second and he rips the stumps out with a flat throw from long-on. The replays, though, show Archer has made it in"
18.3,"Sam Curran to Tom Curran, FOUR runs","oh Tom has this one over Sam. Lovely yorker from Tom, but he gets an outside edge past the diving short third man for four"
18.2,"Sam Curran to Smith, OUT",S Curran has another wicket. Smith has looked out of gas for a wee while now. He looks to whip a length ball to leg but gets no power behind the shot. Caught at deep midwicket. CSK back into this if there is dew later tonight
18.1,"Sam Curran to Tom Curran, 1 run","on a length, on the pads, worked away to long leg for one"
17.6,"Chahar to Tom Curran, 1 run","short of a length, just outside off, pushed for a single. An excellent 18th over. No boundary off it"
17.5,"Chahar to Tom Curran, no run","and they don't have the review so Curran has to walk back but the umpires get together for a chat before sending Curran on his way. This is shambolic umpiring. I am loathe to criticise umpires, but this is really poor. This is a short ball that Curran looks to pull and is beaten. The ball hits the thigh pad of Curran and goes to Dhoni on the half-volley, and he has been given out caught at the wicket. Hang on. The umpires have seen the replay, and are now going to the third umpire. Dhoni doesn;t seem happy with them changing their minds after seeing the replay. Not sure what Dhoni has against it: the umpires are within their rights to change their decision as long as they are consistent and arriving at the right decision. The replays show Curran can go back to bat"
17.4,"Chahar to Tom Curran, no run","short of a length, angling in, giving him no room. Hit back to Chahar. Good over so far"
17.3,"Chahar to Smith, 1 run","this is a slower ball for sure, and he gets a single to deep point with the punch"
17.2,"Chahar to Tom Curran, 1 bye","slower legcutter, short of a length, outside off, beats him, falls in front of Dhoni, and they take a bye off the midfield. Oh replays show this is not a slower ball. It is seam up but just dies upon pitching"
17.1,"Chahar to Smith, 1 run",shuffle across to work a length ball to long leg for one
16.6,"Sam Curran to Parag, OUT","another wicket for Curran as Parag looks to run this down to the other side of short third man. This is short of a length, he has run his fingers on it. Parag opens the face and gets only an edge that is falling in front of Dhoni. The ball nearly pops out of his hands but he does well to hold on"
16.5,"Sam Curran to Parag, FOUR runs","low wide full toss, and it runs off the outer half of his bat for a four between short third man and point"
16.4,"Sam Curran to Parag, 2 runs","wide length ball, driven in front of deep cover, comes back for two. That is crisp connection"
16.3,"Sam Curran to Parag, no run","round the wicket goes Curran, bowls an offcutter, allows him no room. Pushed back to him"
16.2,"Sam Curran to Tewatia, OUT","that is out. Tewatia has been swiping across the line too often here. Given out lbw but he has reviewed it. He has missed a plum full toss, and is hit on the toe. The only question is, if it is angling down. it isn't. He has burnt the review"
16.1,"Sam Curran to Smith, 1 run","slower ball, on a length, around, cutting away, gets a single to deep cover"
15.6,"Ngidi to Tewatia, no run","slower ball, on a length, and he swipes across it. Beaten"

15.4,"Ngidi to Tewatia, FOUR runs","lovely clean strike, Ngidi bowls regulation pace and length. Tewatia stands tall and goes over wide mid-off for four"
15.3,"Ngidi to Smith, 1 run",worked into the leg side for one
15.2,"Ngidi to Smith, FOUR runs","Smith is on the floor, and the ball is at the fine-leg fence. Smith premeditates to counter Ngidi's wide bowling, and ramps his over short fine. In the process he is on his back on the flor"

14.6,"Chawla to Tewatia, 1 run","wrong'un, takes the outside edge, and goes for a single to short third man. Chawla ends a good comeback, but he has still conceded 55 off his four overs"
14.5,"Chawla to Smith, 1 run","wide on the crease, slider, Smith happy with a single"
14.4,"Chawla to Tewatia, 1 run","on a length, Tewatia can't get under it, punched down to long-off"

14.1,"Chawla to Uthappa, OUT","Uthappa tries to hit him for another six, chips down the track, but gets too close to the ball and hence can't get the elevation he needs. This is timed well, but straight and low to du Plessis at long-off. Disappointing effort from Uthappa"

13.5,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run","short of a length, punched away for one"
13.4,"Jadeja to Smith, SIX runs","dropped by Curran at wide long-off. Jadeja continues to bowl wide. This is round-arm too. Smith reaches for it, and mis-hits towards Curran, but he is so close to the boundary that he is worried about the rope behind it, and the ball pops out of his hand and for a six"
13.4,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 wide","wide outside off, past that guide line, and it is called"
13.3,"Jadeja to Uthappa, 1 run","Uthappa looks to hit down the ground, is hit on the inside edge and takes a single to deep midwicket"

13.1,"Jadeja to Uthappa, 1 run","wide length ball, quick, pushed to deep cover"
12.6,"Chawla to Uthappa, 1 run","nice length here, and some turn. Amazing what happens once your tormentor is gone. Only a single to cover"
12.5,"Chawla to Uthappa, no run",appeal for stumping as he is beaten by a wrong'un but he is safe
12.4,"Chawla to Uthappa, no run",looks to go to long-off but can't go past Chawla
12.3,"Chawla to Smith, 1 run",
12.2,"Chawla to Uthappa, 1 run",pushed down the ground
12.1,"Chawla to Uthappa, no run",pushed back to him as Chawla is quick
11.6,"Ngidi to Smith, 1 run, OUT","slower ball again, worked into a hole on the leg side, and has Miller lost his bat while diving to make it to the non-striker's end? Oh he has lost his bat while diving but has Jadhav broken the wicket with his hand before colelcting the ball? Miller is definitely short of the ground, and the third umpire doesn't seem to be considering the possibility of Jadhav having messed up this run-out. He rules it out. Miller gone without facing a ball on RR debut. Good thinking by the fielder in the deep to go to the far end because Miller was surprised by the call for two. And Jadhav's collection was clean as. The earlier replays created an illusion it might not have been"
11.5,"Ngidi to Smith, no run","short of a length, cramps him up, punches this back to Ngidi"
11.5,"Ngidi to Smith, 1 wide","another slower ball, wide down the leg side"
11.4,"Ngidi to Samson, OUT","and they finally get rid of Samson. Ngidi keeps hiding the ball from Samson. No pace on, and wide outside off. Samson still thinks of hitting this over cover for six, but he doesn't get the timing. Off the toe end it goes for a catch to deep cover. What a lovely innings from Samson"

10.3,"Jadeja to Samson, SIX runs","oh man this is some hitting. Jadeja got away once, but Samson is waiting for the next one. his is slightly fuller, slightly closer to off, and Samson lofts it over long-off. It is like a range-hitting season"

10.1,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run",Jadeja good at bowling that length that is not in his arc but also not short. Concedes only a single
9.6,"Chawla to Smith, 1 run","this one has no room on it, and he gets away with a single. If he doesn't bowl another over, Chawla could avoid a fifty tonight. But who will bowl his overs?"
9.5,"Chawla to Smith, FOUR runs","and now he is too short, and Smith plays a late cut to beat a slow-motion dive from Watson at short third man"
9.4,"Chawla to Samson, 1 run","this time he avoids that full length, and Samson punches this to deep cover"
9.3,"Chawla to Samson, SIX runs","Chawla has to be a sucker for punishment. He is not looking to shorten his length, Just keeps up rolling these into his arc, and Boutros Boutros Ghali, Samson loves it in the slot. Another straight six"
9.2,"Chawla to Smith, 1 run",driven to deep cover
9.1,"Chawla to Smith, SIX runs","Chawla is continuing to pitch it up, and when you don't get any dip on the ball, you are asking for punishment on smaller grounds. And he has drilled this back over his head for another six"
8.6,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run",worked into the leg side for a other single
8.5,"Jadeja to Samson, 1 run","winds up for a big hit, but the lack of turn on this one means it takes the inside edge"
8.4,"Jadeja to Samson, no run",well bowled. Full but not full enough for his lofted shots. Gets the inside edge on the drive

8.2,"Jadeja to Smith, no run","huge shout for lbw against Smith, not given, and they won't review it. Plays right across the line of this, but doesn't seem to have straightened enough. Hello, the replay shows it did straighten enough and would have hit the leg stump. Missed out there"
8.1,"Jadeja to Samson, 1 run","darted into the pads, not letting him get under it. He takes a single to leg"
7.6,"Chawla to Smith, SIX runs","Lovely Jubbly. Smith into the act now. Chalwa remains short, wide, flat, and Smith goes over extra cover. This is an exhibition. Twenty-eight off this over. He went for 21 in the whole last match"
7.6,"Chawla to Samson, (no ball) 1 run","Chawla drags this short. Whatever you do, don't let him drive. Samson punches this to deep cover for a single. And this is a no-ball too so Smith gets a free hit now"
7.5,"Chawla to Samson, SIX runs","Yo Yo Ma. This is sweet hitting. Chawla is in his slot again, and he clears from front leg to send it sailing back over his head. This is lovely batting"

7.1,"Chawla to Samson, SIX runs","Samson is some mood tonight. Chawla starts off full too, and he clears his front leg to send it over long-on. Smooth easy hitting"
6.6,"Jadeja to Smith, no run","looks to drive to long-off, but gets hit on the inside half of the bat. A much-needed dot for Jadeja"

6.4,"Jadeja to Samson, no run","flatter, quicker, shorter, played to cover"
6.3,"Jadeja to Samson, SIX runs","Jadeja shows some heart but not sure it is wise here. He flights it up again, and Samson nonchalantly lofts this over long-off, and it is huge. Hits the top of the grandstand"
6.2,"Jadeja to Samson, SIX runs",Samson loves this small boundaries. Keeps his head down and swings through the line of a full ball on the pads. Over wide long-on it goes
6.1,"Jadeja to Smith, 1 run","low full toss, driven to deep midwicket for one"
5.6,"Chahar to Smith, 1 run","slower short ball, Smith shapes up for the pull, and then decides to go ahead with it. Except that this is pulled to mid-off (crazy, right?) for one"
5.5,"Chahar to Smith, FOUR runs","wide on the crease, and ends up angling this too far down the leg side. Glanced away fine of short fine leg. Not good bowling"
5.4,"Chahar to Samson, 1 run","backs away as Chahar runs in, then gets back to his original position when Chahar bowls. Chahar bowls length and straight. Pushed wide of mid-on for one"

4.4,"Sam Curran to Samson, SIX runs","another short ball, straight at him, and he nonchalantly pulls it over square leg for six. With short square boundaries here, not sure you want to go short at Curran's pace"
4.3,"Sam Curran to Samson, FOUR runs","cheeky. Short ball, no room, extra bouncer, and Samson steers it between the keeper and short third man. Doesn't bother with keeping it down"
4.2,"Sam Curran to Samson, no run","and Samson moves the other way, backing away to create room. Curran goes wide outside off, and beats his attempt to cut"
4.1,"Sam Curran to Smith, 1 run","the shuffle across continues, Curran sticks to his guns, bowling short of the driving length and outside off. Smith takes a single to mid-off"
3.6,"Ngidi to Samson, 2 runs","digs this one in short, Samson is ready for the hook, but mis-times it. He is looking square leg, but ends up hitting this over wide mid-on. Has enough behind it to clear the circle, though"

3.4,"Ngidi to Samson, no run","on a length, around off, in the slot but Samson is looking to get himself in.Pushes this to leg"

3.2,"Ngidi to Smith, no run","shaping up for another big hit, but this length ball doesn't quite come on to the bat and he ends up adjusting the shot for a push to leg"
3.1,"Ngidi to Smith, SIX runs",what a welcome to Ngidi. Smith shuffles across and whips a gentle length ball over long leg for a six. Easy as
2.6,"Chahar to Smith, 1 run","slower bouncer, around off, dabbed down towards point for a single"
2.5,"Chahar to Smith, FOUR runs","tries the bouncer, but there is no bounce in the pitch. Easily pulled away over midwicket for four"

2.3,"Chahar to Samson, 1 run","goes full looking for swing, but angles it down leg for a single to long leg"
2.2,"Chahar to Jaiswal, OUT","smart bowling. Jaiswal sees this is shortish again, and thinks he has another boundary for the taking, but this is slightly wider and bounces a touch extra. Takes the top endge for an easy catch towards Dhoni, but Chahar is so committed to it that Dhoni lets him take it"
2.1,"Chahar to Jaiswal, FOUR runs","the first boundary of the innings. This is only slightly short of a length, and despite being a tall man, Jaiswal manages to go back enough to create his length and pulls it over midwicket"
1.6,"Sam Curran to Smith, no run","shuffling across again, and Curran is winning this battle by keeping the ball away from Smith. This short ball has tennis-ball bounce, and sails over his attempted cut. Excellent start for CSK"
1.5,"Sam Curran to Smith, no run",Curran slips in the short ball as Smith walks down at him this time. Hits the bottom half of the bat as Smith tries to pull
1.4,"Sam Curran to Jaiswal, 1 run","angling in, on a length, tucked away to long leg"
1.3,"Sam Curran to Smith, 1 run","and this is good bowling. Even though Smith shuffles enough to make connection with a wide length ball, the deep cover-point is in place to prevent a boundary"

1.2,"Sam Curran to Smith, 1 wide","Smith shuffles wide, Curran goes wider, and is called for it"
1.1,"Sam Curran to Smith, no run",starts off with a slow delivery on a length outside off. Pushed to cover-point
0.6,"Chahar to Smith, 1 run",misses out on a juicy short wide delivery again as he can't find the gap between point and cover-point. Gaekwad's misfield gives them a single. It could have easily been 12 off this over
0.5,"Chahar to Smith, no run",missed out on a leg-side half-volley as he finds the man by the side of the square-leg umpire
0.4,"Chahar to Smith, 2 runs","shuffles across, takes a length ball from off to work it past square leg for a couple"
0.3,"Chahar to Jaiswal, 1 run","short of a length, outside ff, he goes back to steer it to third man"

0.1,"Chahar to Jaiswal, no run","after a two-minute delay, we finally have a ball bowled. It starts outside off, and swings further away. Left alone by Jaiswal. Close to being called a wide"
19.4,"Steyn to Sandeep, OUT","taken at long-on! That's the win for RCB. Sandeep with a sweet connection, but Kohli tracks backwards and leaps to grab on to that. Short ball, good pull, but Sunrisers will lose by 10 runs"

18.2,"Dubey to Marsh, OUT","holes out to long-on. Smart bowling from Dube. Making him fetch that from outside off, because foot movement is out of the question. Slower ball, looping outside off. Comes off the toe-end and that's that for Marsh. Can barely stay on his feet and off he goes with the physio for support"
18.1,"Dubey to Sandeep, 1 run","short of a length at off stump, mistimed pull out to long-on. Marsh hobbles through to the other end. There's a misfield at long-on, but he can barely jog at the moment"
17.6,"Saini to Rashid Khan, OUT","tonks off stump! Full and honing in at off stump. Nothing adventurous about this shot either, just an attempted drive. But Saini is  rapid. Just too good. He has done his job to perfection"
17.5,"Saini to Sandeep, 1 run","yorker at middle stump, watchfully pushed down to long-on"
17.4,"Saini to Bhuvneshwar, OUT","knocks the middle stump out! Full, straight, too fast for Bhuvi. Top class. Looking to drive that to long-on with a straight bat, not a lot wrong with the attempt. It's just too fast for him"

17.2,"Saini to Rashid Khan, 1 run","short outside off, whippy cut, straight to third man"
17.2,"Saini to Rashid Khan, 5 wide","another bouncer but this goes all wrong for Saini. Chases him down leg side with another bouncer. It's above the head, it's way down leg side, it's past Philippe's left hand"
17.1,"Saini to Rashid Khan, no run",bouncer first up. Heading for his helmet. Rashid is quick to duck under that
16.6,"Dubey to Abhishek, 1 run, OUT","collision and run out! Rashid Khan is on the floor. It was a cutter, flicked into the leg side. To deep midwicket. They wanted two, they were both ball watching. Sharma had run to the side that would be around the wicket for the right handed bowler to him. Rashid was on the same path at the other end. They were, essentially, headed for each other and in the moment, with the ball-watching, had no idea where the other person was. Sharma was on his feet, and he ran through, so he's the one dismissed."
16.5,"Dubey to Rashid Khan, 1 run","length on off stump, waits on that and jabs into the covers off the front foot"
16.4,"Dubey to Rashid Khan, FOUR runs","four first up. Easy does it for the main man now for SRH. Slower ball, short and wide outside off. Waits on it, old fashioned square cut between backward point and third man"
16.3,"Dubey to Garg, OUT","bat, onto helmet, onto stumps! Length ball outside off, walks into the off side and looks for the ramp. It's off the leading edge, onto his grille, and then it lobs onto off stump. This chase is coming completely apart now"
16.2,"Dubey to Abhishek, 1 run","offcutter, short of a length at middle stump. Looks to whip into the leg side, deflected towards short fine off the thigh"
16.1,"Dubey to Garg, 1 run","length at off stump, tapped down to long-on off the back foot"
15.6,"Chahal to Abhishek, FOUR runs","oh hello! Hello Abhishek Sharma. Jumps down, meets this full ball at the pitch and drills it straight over the bowler. Confident stuff that, superbly executed"
15.5,"Chahal to Garg, 1 run","full on leg stump, tucked to deep midwicket off the front foot"
15.4,"Chahal to Abhishek, 1 run","tossed up at off stump, driven along the floor to long-off"
15.3,"Chahal to Shankar, OUT","bowled him with an absolute beauty! Wow! Sensational! Googly lobbed right up, just outside off. Shankar looked completely out of sorts, playing for the turn and looking to drive on the off side. Huge, huge gap between bat and pad and middle stump takes a tonk. What a delivery. And what a player he is for RCB, keeping them in it again and again and again"
15.2,"Chahal to Bairstow, OUT","bowled him! Oh boy oh boy oh boy, what was Bairstow thinking there? Look for your Fazeer Mohammed clips because this is fully deserving of an animated ""why did he dooo thaaat?"" Full floaty ball at leg stump, gets the front leg into the leg side and unleashes the most ungainly heave and misses entirely. Leg stump takes a knock and RCB will suddenly feel energised with the inexperience coming for SRH. Top knock from YJB until that ball"
15.1,"Chahal to Bairstow, no run","length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
14.6,"Steyn to Garg, no run","past the outside edge. Length ball wide outside off, opens the face and has a swish"
14.5,"Steyn to Garg, 2 runs","third umpire checking for run out at striker's end. He's well in. A full ball flicked to Padikkal's right at deep midwicket, they take his arm on and do it successfully"
14.4,"Steyn to Garg, FOUR runs","scythed off the thick inside edge and it trickles to deep square's left and beats him to the boundary. A short ball again, throws his bat at it with a pull and gets no real timing on that. But midwicket is in and there is a gap out there"
14.3,"Steyn to Bairstow, 1 run","dropped at deep midwicket. A difficult one though, diving forward at a dipping ball to his left. Padikkal there. Short ball outside off and he laced this with the pull, flat and dipping rapidly at the fielder"
14.3,"Steyn to Bairstow, 1 wide","yorker length down leg side, can't get the flick away"
14.2,"Steyn to Bairstow, FOUR runs","expertly carved past short third. Yorker length outside off, just hangs deep, slight arch back, and the perfect opening of the face to get it to that fielder's left"
14.1,"Steyn to Garg, 1 run",full and just outside off. A stylish chip to long-on's left
13.6,"Yadav to Bairstow, FOUR runs","pristine! Length ball sitting up outside off at the perfect pace, and he gets his weight into it even without a big forward stride. Races to extra cover's left"
13.5,"Yadav to Garg, 1 run",short ad up at the front shoulder. Inside edge lands pitch side after his attempted hook
13.4,"Yadav to Bairstow, 1 bye","beaten and the keeper fumbles too. Short and just outside off, looks to chop but that dips in and is past the inside edge. Keeps on moving to Philippe's left and it looks like it's hit him awkwardly on the fingers. He's getting some help from the physio"
13.3,"Yadav to Bairstow, FOUR runs","brings up a half century with some brute force. Dropped short at an off stump line with square leg in the circle. Poor from Umesh, but majestic short-arm pull from Bairstow. Drops to deep midwicket's right and skids into the ad boards"
13.2,"Yadav to Bairstow, 2 runs","length on leg stump, tucked into the midwicket region with soft hands"
13.1,"Yadav to Bairstow, 2 runs","Steyn drops it! Oh boy, that looks utterly ordinary with the catch, but has he managed a run out? Short ball at middle stump, through the pull shot too early. Top edge hands up at fine leg. Steyn has completely lost it running back and to his left. Has the reverse cup ready, and has to follow it awkwardly down with reverse cup. In the end, he can't even get a hand to it. Completely lost that in the sky. Managed to keep it from touching the boundary. Bairstow well in on the run out chance"
12.6,"Dubey to Garg, no run","slower ball, short of a good length outside off. Looks to work it leg side but it's back to the bowler"
12.5,"Dubey to Garg, no run","slower ball, short of a length and wide outside off. Backs away and looks to flat-bat through the off side. Beaten"
12.4,"Dubey to Garg, 2 leg byes","length at middle stump, steps out and looks to flick. Looks like an inside edge onto pad that deflects to the keeper's right. Or not, according to the umpire. It's gone far enough for him to come back for the second"
12.3,"Dubey to Garg, no run","length outside off, defended to backward point"
12.2,"Dubey to Garg, 2 runs","length at middle stump, walks across his stumps and flicks to fine leg's left. Kohli wanted more urgency from that fielder. Garg gets off the mark with a double"
12.1,"Dubey to Bairstow, 1 run","full on middle stump, jammed down to long-on"
11.6,"Chahal to Pandey, OUT","oh but he gifts one next ball! Full and loopy outside off, looks to loft him over long-off. Gets nowhere near enough connection. Saini takes it some 10-15 yards inside. A tired, lazy shot at best, that one"
11.5,"Chahal to Pandey, no run","there's a noise here and an appeal for catch behind. Kohli reviews. Full ball tossed right outside off, spinning towards the wide marker. Pandey looked to slug that over extra cover and it spun past the bat, thinks the umpire. UltraEdge shows a flat line. That's the review lost."
11.4,"Chahal to Bairstow, 1 run","full outside off, reverse sweep straight to short third"
11.3,"Chahal to Bairstow, no run","full and wide outside off, driven to extra cover"
11.2,"Chahal to Bairstow, 4 byes","is that a missed stumping? Looks like it. Full and down leg side. Down the track, big swing and nowhere near it. Philippe is rooted in his squat, can't even move to his left as this slides between batsman and leg stump"
11.1,"Chahal to Pandey, 1 run","full on leg stump, thumped down to long-on"
10.6,"Saini to Bairstow, no run","just past off stump. Expects this short of a length ball to rise, but it's low and past his pull shot. This exact thing has happened to many batsmen this evening"
10.5,"Saini to Bairstow, no run","length outside off, jammed to mid-off's left"
10.4,"Saini to Bairstow, 2 runs","dropped at extra cover! Finch with the reverse cup. It's drilled at him. Very very hard. Just bursts through his hands. He was in position and all, hands behind it, but it is just too quick for him. An overpitched ball slaughtered by Bairstow at head height, just to his right"
10.3,"Saini to Pandey, 1 run",short and into the body. Shapes to pull but is done for pace. Adjusts and guides it to third man instead
10.2,"Saini to Bairstow, 1 run","full and into the pads. Looks to flick it away, only deflected to midwicket's right off the pad"
10.1,"Saini to Pandey, 1 run","yorker length at middle stump, jammed down to long-on"
9.6,"Chahal to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length and spinning away, backs away to punch to sweeper cover"
9.5,"Chahal to Bairstow, 1 run","full on leg stump, driven down to long-on"
9.4,"Chahal to Bairstow, no run","good length, slow and turning at off stump. Steps out and is forced to dead-bat that because he's nowhere near the pitch"
9.3,"Chahal to Bairstow, 2 runs","short and just outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
9.2,"Chahal to Pandey, 1 run","length at middle stump. Looks to work that for the turn, into the covers, but it skids on and pings to midwicket off the inside edge"
9.1,"Chahal to Bairstow, 1 run",length and skidding on at middle stump. Tapped into the leg side off the back foot
8.6,"Yadav to Bairstow, 1 run","full slower ball at middle stump, drilled down to long-on off the front foot"
8.5,"Yadav to Bairstow, FOUR runs",similar areas from both batsman and bowler. But it's an inside edge on the attemped cover drive that gives Jonny the runs at fine leg this time
8.4,"Yadav to Bairstow, SIX runs","expertly done. Such a good batsman. Anticipated the line and length and just jumped into the off side and got under it. From there, he nails the ramp and it's quickly over the fine boundary"
8.3,"Yadav to Bairstow, no run","beaten on the pull. Short of a length in the corridor, swipes above that one"
8.2,"Yadav to Pandey, 1 run","length on middle stump, driven firmly to long-on's left"
8.1,"Yadav to Bairstow, 1 run","length and just outside off, opens the face and taps to point's left"
7.6,"Chahal to Bairstow, 1 run","length on middle, punched to long-on's right"
7.5,"Chahal to Bairstow, 2 runs","length outside off, good skill this time in maneuvering that fine. Got down on a knee and ramped it. Long leg cleans up"
7.4,"Chahal to Bairstow, no run",past the edge again. Dangles it slow and wide outside off. Bairstow forward and half-hearted in that poke
7.3,"Chahal to Pandey, 1 run","length and slow at leg stump, leans in and chips to long-on"
7.2,"Chahal to Pandey, no run","rips it past the edge! Whew, that was gorgeous viewing. Dip, drift, grip and then past Pandey's forward defence"
7.1,"Chahal to Pandey, no run","length on off stump, driven with the turn to extra cover"
6.6,"Sundar to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length at middle, clipped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
6.5,"Sundar to Pandey, no run","full and just outside off, there for the drive and he nails it but straight to extra cover"
6.4,"Sundar to Pandey, no run","length at off, defended off the back foot"
6.3,"Sundar to Pandey, no run","short of a length, pulled to midwicket"
6.2,"Sundar to Pandey, SIX runs","ohhh yessss! That echoed in Dubai! Floated up into the slot and he wasted no time, plants the front leg out and into the leg side before swinging it 91 metres in the midwicket direction"
6.1,"Sundar to Pandey, no run","length and sliding on outside off, slapped on the bounce to extra cover"
5.6,"Saini to Pandey, 1 run","low full toss outside off, chopped to mid-off's left"
5.5,"Saini to Bairstow, 1 run","length at off stump, dropped pitch side off the back foot"
5.4,"Saini to Bairstow, FOUR runs","another pick-up into the leg side. Short and climbing in the corridor. Similar to most of the last few deliveries, but a different strategy this time. Hoicks without fuss to the midwicket boundary"
5.3,"Saini to Pandey, 1 run","length outside off, looks to force that on the up. It trickles to mid-on off the inside half"
5.2,"Saini to Pandey, no run",short of a length and skidding on outside off. Mistimed punch on the up
5.1,"Saini to Bairstow, 1 run","length on off stump, tapped to mid-off's left on the rise"
4.6,"Yadav to Pandey, no run","length outside off, driven on the rise to extra cover"
4.5,"Yadav to Bairstow, 1 run","length on off stump, punched to mid-on off the inside of the bat"
4.4,"Yadav to Pandey, 1 run","length on off stump, flicks it onto his own pad off the inside edge. A run sneaked pitch side"
4.3,"Yadav to Pandey, no run","length and just outside off, punched back to the bowler on the up"
4.2,"Yadav to Pandey, FOUR runs","on the pads again! Umesh really struggling for line. This one is yorker length, Pandey is shimmying quickly to meet it on the full and he gets it past short fine"
4.1,"Yadav to Pandey, FOUR runs",sweetly put away. Throwdown right onto his pads and he uses the pace and offers the full face of the bat to clip this to mid-on's right
3.6,"Saini to Bairstow, 2 runs","short and just outside off, slashes at that. Point gets a hand to it diving to his left"
3.5,"Saini to Bairstow, no run","good length and just outside off, looks to force that on the up and against the angle. It's hit the inside of his bat"
3.4,"Saini to Pandey, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, jumps inside the line and deflects it to third man's left"
3.3,"Saini to Bairstow, 1 run","short of good length outside off, mistimed drive on the up to mid-off"
3.2,"Saini to Bairstow, no run","whistles past the inside edge. Slammed in at a good length, just outside off. Bairstow swishes for the original line but the angle beats him"
3.1,"Saini to Pandey, 1 run","one bounce to third man. He wanted to cut and withdrew, and somehow the outside edge still nearly carried out to that fielder"
2.6,"Steyn to Pandey, 1 run","length on middle, clipped to midwicket's left. Chahal seems to have jarred his knee into the turf. He's walking off but he looks in good spirits, maybe a temporary break"
2.5,"Steyn to Pandey, FOUR runs","evades mid-on and has enough on it to find the boundary. Full ball at middle, drives uppishly, almost shoveled with the bottom hand because he's not to the pitch. It's between non-striker and mid-on"
2.4,"Steyn to Pandey, no run",short and in the corridor. Too late on the pull and it's no work for midwicket
2.3,"Steyn to Pandey, 2 runs",full and into the pads. Whips it off the toes to fine leg's left
2.2,"Steyn to Pandey, no run","length at off stump, defended towards midwicket off the inside half of the bat"
2.1,"Steyn to Pandey, no run",lbw appeal turned down. Half an appeal. Short of a length and climbing into his thigh as he looks to glance that
1.6,"Yadav to Bairstow, no run",length and at the stumps. Solidly defended on the front foot
1.5,"Yadav to Bairstow, no run","length and just outside off, blocked on the front foot"
1.4,"Yadav to Bairstow, OUT","he has Warner out backing up! Oh boy, this is huge. Ain't gonne be no spirit of cricket talk tonight for sure. Length ball just outside off, Bairstow absolutley cannons this drive on the up, back at Umesh. Technically, it is a dropped catch. He sticks one hand out and can't hold on, because well, he's only human. But, the hand is important because Warner is meandering and he is caught well out off the deflections"
1.3,"Yadav to Bairstow, SIX runs","helped over the fine leg boundary! If there ever was a shot to sum up a batsman, it's this half-pull, half-ramp from Bairstow. Quick, short and at his hips. Barely does more than bring his bat from underneath that and lift it with the angle"
1.2,"Yadav to Bairstow, FOUR runs",overpitched and on the toes. This time Bairstow does manage to get bat and he does it with good effect. Flicked to fine leg's left and Steyn's dive is not good enough
1.2,"Yadav to Bairstow, 1 wide","length and down leg side again. Looking to get the outswinger going, no luck so far"
1.2,"Yadav to Bairstow, 1 wide",short of a length and down leg side. Flying take from Philippe down leg side
1.1,"Yadav to Bairstow, no run",appeal for lbw turned down. Length ball skids on past his poke from the crease. Past the inside edge but hitting him outside leg stump
0.6,"Steyn to Warner, no run","length and in the corridor, defended to point from the crease"
0.5,"Steyn to Warner, no run","beaten. Length ball skids on, very very low. Looks to just feel for that as it skids between inside edge and off stump"
0.4,"Steyn to Warner, no run","full outside off, scythes at it from inside the line, on the bounce to backward point"
0.3,"Steyn to Warner, 2 runs","full and wide outside off again, throws his hands at this again, down one knee. Not quite timed. Beats extra cover to the left"
0.2,"Steyn to Warner, FOUR runs",crunched. Overpitched and a lot of room outside off. He has nailed that drive to mid-off's right
0.1,"Steyn to Warner, no run","short of a length and climbing, outside off. Left alone"
19.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Dubey, OUT","Bairstow runs at the stumps and finishes the run-out. Beaten on the hook, is Dube. Just wanders half-heartedly for the run. Philippe not interested. Bairstow completes the job"
19.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Philippe, 1 run","slower ball at a length, wide outside off again. He's outfoxed once more, just manages a flap at that. It rolls out to long-off"
19.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Philippe, no run","beaten. Knuckle ball, it appears. Good length and loopy wide outside off. Lines up for the slog sweep but can't get the timing right"
19.3,"Bhuvneshwar to AB, 1 run, OUT","sensational work from Pandey at long-off! What a throw. Slower ball just outside off, mistimed punch to his left at long-off. Pandey swoops down on it, winds up his throwing arm and sends it one bounce to the keeper's end, mere inches from the stumps. Bairstow only has to complete a simple movement. Super, super stuff from Pandey. Beats AB's dive"
19.2,"Bhuvneshwar to AB, 2 runs","half century. Every season, it is this man at the end for RCB. Full ball outside off, swatted to long-off's left  on the front foot"
19.1,"Bhuvneshwar to AB, FOUR runs","pumped straight over the bowler. Full at middle stump, deep in the crease waiting for it and a clean loft to get it over the boundary, one bounce"
18.6,"Sandeep to AB, 1 run","yorker at the stumps, jammed to deep midwicket"
18.5,"Sandeep to AB, no run","beaten by the yorker. Full and honing in at the corridor, can't get close to connecting on that"
18.4,"Sandeep to AB, SIX runs","whipped over extra this time! And off the back foot. Welcome back, AB. Ridiculous shots. Doing precisely what the bowler wants him to do and still managing sixes. This was short and rising up in the corridor. He leaped up at it and flat-batted it well in front of square"
18.3,"Sandeep to AB, SIX runs","clubbed over extra cover! Sandeep was looking to take away the slog and the scoop with that last ball. Goes with the same ball again, length, slow and wide. This time he waits for it and hits it on the up, way way back. Stunning hit on a slow pitch"
18.2,"Sandeep to AB, no run","beaten. Expertly done. Slower ball, good length and wide outside off. Looks to slog that and is beaten"
18.1,"Sandeep to Dubey, 1 run","slower ball smashed into the pitch, short of a length and at the body. Backs away and hammers it only to fine long-off"
17.6,"Natarajan to Dubey, 1 run",another yorker and he can only turn it to deep square with a flick
17.5,"Natarajan to Dubey, 2 runs","yorker at leg stump, clipped between deep square and fine leg"
17.4,"Natarajan to Dubey, no run","nicely bowled. Jams that into the surface and rolls the fingers at it. It grips and gets big to cramp Dube, who was backing away. He can only tap it back at the bowler"
17.3,"Natarajan to AB, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked to short fine's left"
17.2,"Natarajan to AB, FOUR runs","lofts it straight and firmly. Overpitched this time, narrowly missing the yorker. Enough for AB to swing from underneath it, flat and to the straight boundary"
17.1,"Natarajan to Dubey, 1 run",nails the yorker. At middle stump and turned out to deep square with a flick
16.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Dubey, 1 run","length at off stump, allows that on and opens the face to get it down to third man"
16.5,"Bhuvneshwar to AB, 1 run","full outside off, looks to crunch it through the covers, thick inside edge down to long-on"
16.4,"Bhuvneshwar to AB, FOUR runs","chipped to the midwicket boundary. Slower ball at a good length, on middle. Looks like midwicket was in and he just looks to get it there. Would have been caught with a fielder in the deep, but this is one bounce over the line and very deliberate"
16.3,"Bhuvneshwar to AB, no run",nearly chops on! Short ball slants inwards as AB looks to cut this behind square on the off side. Bounces through to the keeper
16.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Dubey, 1 run","short at middle stump, hurriedly tucks it to midwicket's left"
16.1,"Bhuvneshwar to AB, 1 run",full slower ball outside off. Driven off the low part of the bat to long-off
15.6,"Natarajan to AB, 1 run","slower ball, full and just outside off. Driven to long-off"
15.5,"Natarajan to Kohli, OUT","taken at deep midwicket. Length ball at middle stump, hangs back and looks to slog that over the midwicket boundary. It's come off the inside half and Rashid settles comfortably underneath that to take the catch. His first real attempt at clearing the boundary today and it doesn't come off. A nice little comeback has happened from Natarajan this evening after his first over"
15.4,"Natarajan to AB, 1 run","yorker at middle stump, jammed down to long-on"
15.3,"Natarajan to AB, FOUR runs","carved wide of sweeper cover. Full and wide outside off, down on one knee, and a gorgeous looking free-flowing aerial drive to that fielder's right"
15.2,"Natarajan to Kohli, 1 run","dropped short and at his chest. Pulled firmly, straight to deep midwicket"
15.1,"Natarajan to AB, 1 run","short of a length at leg stump, flicked out to deep midwicket"
14.6,"Rashid Khan to AB, 1 run","length on off stump, nudged into the covers"
14.5,"Rashid Khan to AB, 2 runs","length at middle stump, whipped to deep midwicket's left off the back foot and another second run stolen"

14.3,"Rashid Khan to AB, 1 run","length outside off, driven to sweeper's right"

13.6,"Sandeep to Kohli, 1 run","slower ball at middle stump, gets forward and pushes to deep square"
13.5,"Sandeep to Kohli, no run","length at middle stump, steps out and can't get the flick away. Nudges it back down the pitch"
13.4,"Sandeep to Kohli, 2 runs",another full slower one on leg stump. Shuffles and flicks to fine leg's right
13.3,"Sandeep to AB, 1 run","slower ball, full and just outside off. Driven to point's right off the outside half"

11.3,"Abhishek to AB, 1 run","full at off stump, driven with the turn to long-off"
11.2,"Abhishek to AB, no run","length and slow at off stump, tapped to extra cover on the front foot"
11.1,"Abhishek to Finch, OUT",that is plumb. Or looks plumb anyway. Two in two for SRH. Full and in at middle stump. Finch plants the front leg well across and looks to sweep him. Caught in front of middle stump. Didn't come off at all for Finch tonight. That looked like a carrom ball from Sharma. Certianly the knuckles involved anyway. Seam pointed towards first slip.
10.6,"Shankar to Padikkal, OUT","bowled him! And a big celebration from Shankar. He has his man. Full and slanted into leg stump. He gets the front leg out of the way and looks to clobber that into the leg side stands. Misses and loses his stumps. No one will fault him for that shot. He's more than done the work tonight. His last few balls were a struggle, but the pace has been set"
10.5,"Shankar to Finch, 1 run","length on off stump, driven to extra cover on the front foot"
10.4,"Shankar to Finch, no run","short and just outside off, cut straight to point"
10.3,"Shankar to Padikkal, 1 run","length at the stumps, clipped to short fine"
10.2,"Shankar to Padikkal, no run",beaten. Short and cramping him at an off stump line. Backs away for the cut and misses
10.1,"Shankar to Padikkal, 2 runs","a full mix up and another drop! Oh SRH are falling apart. Nearly a collision too. Length ball at middle, looks to slog that and ends up hitting it high between deep square and deep midwicket. Looks like Fabian Allen and Abhishek converging. Neither calling. In the end it pops out of Fabian's hand"
9.6,"Abhishek to Padikkal, 1 run","length at the stumps, on the back foot to punch to sweeper's left"
9.5,"Abhishek to Finch, 1 run","length at off stump, driven to long-off"
9.4,"Abhishek to Padikkal, 1 run","length on middle, punched to long-on off the back foot"
9.3,"Abhishek to Padikkal, FOUR runs","Rashid misjudges at deep square and Padikkal has fifty! Oh the Sharma experiment nearly works. He's been asked to slow it down, he does, he draws a laboured sweep shot from outside off. It's in the air. Rashid runs in and overdoes it, has to lunge with his left hand in the end and can't even get a finger on it"
9.2,"Abhishek to Padikkal, 2 runs","length at middle stump, steps out and gently dabs this in front of deep midwicket to open up the second"
9.1,"Abhishek to Padikkal, 2 runs","length at off stump, onto the back foot to tap to long-on's left"
8.6,"Rashid Khan to Finch, no run","googly, spinning into middle stump. Blocked on the front foot"
8.5,"Rashid Khan to Finch, SIX runs","clears deep square! Full and into the pads. Gets low and sweeps with purpose. Not with great timing, but enough to lift that over the fielder"
8.4,"Rashid Khan to Finch, FOUR runs",clears midwicket. Dropped short but a bit more room this time and he latches onto that and turns it over the infielder. First boundary in nearly four overs
8.3,"Rashid Khan to Finch, no run","googly ripping in at leg stump. Finch exposing the stumps to try and cut, but it's rolled back down the pitch"
8.2,"Rashid Khan to Finch, no run","full and just outside off, backs away and looks to slug it through the off side. Thick inside edge onto pad"
8.1,"Rashid Khan to Padikkal, 1 leg bye","beaten on the reverse sweep. Full ball outside off, he's struck outside off and the lbw appeal is turned down"
7.6,"Natarajan to Padikkal, 1 run","low full toss on the pads, whipped out to deep midwicket"
7.5,"Natarajan to Finch, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
7.4,"Natarajan to Padikkal, 1 run","carved out to sweeper cover. Full and just outside off, exposes the stumps and opens the wrists"
7.3,"Natarajan to Finch, 1 run","full and just outside off, looks to force that through the covers. Off the inside half to mid-on"
7.2,"Natarajan to Finch, no run","beaten. Slower short ball in the corridor, going across him. Pulls from over it"
7.1,"Natarajan to Padikkal, 1 run","length at leg stump, clipped to deep square"
6.6,"Rashid Khan to Padikkal, 1 run","full and at the stumps. Clears the front foot and has a swing at it. Mistimed and off the inside half, down to long-on"
6.5,"Rashid Khan to Finch, 1 run","length on middle stump, nudged down to long-on"
6.4,"Rashid Khan to Padikkal, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
6.3,"Rashid Khan to Finch, 1 run","just short of long-off. Length ball outside off, got to the pitch and creamed that. Flat and straight at the fielder though"
6.2,"Rashid Khan to Padikkal, 1 run","short and wide outside off, backs away and cuts to sweeper cover"
6.1,"Rashid Khan to Finch, 1 run","full on middle stump, driven to long-on"
5.6,"Sandeep to Finch, 1 run","legcutter, short of a length outside off. Dabbed into the covers with soft hands"
5.5,"Sandeep to Padikkal, 1 run",one more yorker. Gets the front leg out of the way and whips firmly to mid-off
5.4,"Sandeep to Padikkal, no run",another perfect yorker. Nice over from Sandeep so far. Follows him down leg side and makes him slice another one off the inside edge to short fine. There's a direct hit too from there but Padikkal is back in the crease
5.3,"Sandeep to Padikkal, no run","yorker at leg stump, looks to jam that out, inside edge to short fine"
5.2,"Sandeep to Padikkal, 2 runs",slower short ball at middle stump. Through the pull shot too early. Thick inside edge to deep square's left
5.1,"Sandeep to Finch, 1 run","slower ball, full and sliding down leg side. Cops it on the pad as he looks to flick"
4.6,"Shankar to Padikkal, no run","full at middle stump, flicked to backward square leg"
4.6,"Shankar to Padikkal, 1 wide","good length but poor line, down leg side and past the attempted glance"
4.5,"Shankar to Finch, 1 run","taken at extra cover. Short outside off, on the back foot again to try and flat-bat that. Scooped feebly into the off side"
4.5,"Shankar to Finch, (no ball) SIX runs",and pumped way over midwicket! And it is another no ball! Dropped short and he pulls this viciously
4.5,"Shankar to Finch, (no ball)",beaten. Good length and outside off. Swishes at that and it doesn't quite sit up. The signal's gone off thought! Third umpire has spotted a foot fault no-ball
4.4,"Marsh to Padikkal, 1 run",length and into the pads. Tucked to mid-on's left off the back foot
4.3,"Marsh to Padikkal, FOUR runs","pummeled over his head. Friendly, floated full ball on off stump. Front leg clear, full face offered, and a brutal batswing"
4.2,"Marsh to Finch, 1 run","length on middle stump, punched past the bowler off the back foot"
4.1,"Marsh to Finch, no run",length and swung away from middle stump. Squares him up as he defends down the track
3.6,"Natarajan to Padikkal, no run","yorker length at off stump, gets the front leg out and jams it straight to extra cover"
3.5,"Natarajan to Padikkal, FOUR runs","clubbed over midwicket. Length ball at middle stump, half a stride again and a good old fashioned leg-side heave, timed to perfection"
3.4,"Natarajan to Padikkal, no run","length at middle stump, defended off the back foot"
3.3,"Natarajan to Padikkal, FOUR runs","over extra cover. Sweet, sweet stuff, this. Overpitched ball outside off, half a stride out and just gets his hands through this so smoothly from underneath"
3.2,"Natarajan to Padikkal, FOUR runs","whipped to deep square's left! Short and up at his hips. Swivels and just turns it, long hands reaching out, and nails the connection. Fielder in the deep is diving desperately but cannot stop"
3.1,"Natarajan to Padikkal, no run",steps out too soon. Was already down the track and down leg side; and this short ball was shaped away from him. Could barely get a shot away
2.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run","length at middle stump, blocked on the front foot"
2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 2 runs","good work down at third man from Natarajan. Short and just outside off, gives it a vicious slash and gets a thick edge to the fielder's right. It's quick and low to his right but he pushes it in when he's about to lose balance"
2.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Padikkal, 1 run","length on leg stump, flicked to deep square from the crease"
2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Padikkal, FOUR runs","squeezes it past cover. Realllyyyyy had to stretch for that. Slower ball, short and very wide. That took a long time coming and wasn't off the middle, but it had enough to trickle away tantalizingly"
2.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Padikkal, no run",beaten. Instinctive shot. This is short of a good length and going across him. Shapes for the pull but no such bounce on this pitch. It skids underneath the bat
2.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Padikkal, no run","slower ball foxes him. It's just outside off, tempting him for the drive on the up. Gets an inside edge that rolls back to the bowler"
1.6,"Sandeep to Finch, no run","massive lbw appeal. He was a few yards down the pitch. An inswinger at length, walked at it, across into the off side trying to flick. Might have been struck just outside off no, it was in line with middle and leg. Probably going down"
1.5,"Sandeep to Padikkal, 1 run","length and wide outside off, reaches out and slashes on the up. Extra cover parries it to mid-off"
1.4,"Sandeep to Padikkal, 2 runs","through the slip region. Slip has gone out after two balls. Sandeep is known to swing it and get the edges, but this is the the game. Full and just outside off. Looks to drive and it's a thick edge. Third man does superbly to his right with the slide"
1.3,"Sandeep to Padikkal, FOUR runs",clipped past short fine. Length and staying low - about shin height - on a leg stump line. Waits on it and turns the wrists late
1.2,"Sandeep to Padikkal, no run","overpitched and swung away from the corridor, a sumptuous, crisp off drive but can't beat mid-off to the right"
1.1,"Sandeep to Padikkal, FOUR runs","carts it over midwicket. Right, he's done his homework and decided whom to target, clearly. Down the track first ball, short of a length at middle and angled away from him. But it doesn't matter, he just goes through the line"
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run","big inswinger from outside off. Really hoops back in sharply as Finch gets on the front foot. To his credit, doesn't plant it across the stumps. Big inside edge onto pad"
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run",full and into the pads. A bat-pad situation as he looks to flick. There's half an appeal
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Padikkal, 1 run","full and swinging away from the corridor. Closes the face on that and taps it to mid-on's left for his first run. Not much of a stride, but he is a tall man"
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Padikkal, no run","short and pushed across his corridor. Very wide, in fact. Has a slash and is well beaten"
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Padikkal, 1 wide",full and swung way down leg side. Can't get bat on it
0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Padikkal, no run","length at off stump, some shape away again. Defended into the covers"
0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Padikkal, no run","good length, swung away and going through to the keeper on the bounce. Just outside the off stump and he let that go"
19.6,"Stoinis to Jordan, OUT","he's hit a full toss straight to square leg! Low full toss at leg stump, flicked firmly and Rabada with the magix reflexes to force a super over"
19.5,"Stoinis to Agarwal, OUT","he's found sweeper cover! Can you believe it! All fielders in the circle, only the sweeper back. It's a full toss wide outside off. He swishes at it, just trying to guide it, but he's found Hetmyer! Oh he'll kick himself for this. What an innings it has been, falls just short of taking them over"
19.4,"Stoinis to Agarwal, no run","beaten. Short and wide outside off, looks to play the hook and it's well beaten. But they can afford that now. It's also the bouncer out of the equation for the next two balls"
19.3,"Stoinis to Agarwal, FOUR runs","he's tied it! Incredible! Full ball at the stumps, backs away once more and slices it to long-off's left. Mohit with the big dive to get a hand on that, but it gets tangled up in his body as he makes connection with the boundary padding"
19.2,"Stoinis to Agarwal, 2 runs","yorker at middles stump, squeezed down to long-on's right and once again Jordan is back for the second Mayank has to dive as the throw comes in at his end"
19.1,"Stoinis to Agarwal, SIX runs","long long way over the bowler! Full and floated up at the stumps, Mayank lines it up with his leg well into the leg side and crunches it"
18.6,"Rabada to Agarwal, 1 run","low full toss outside off, gets down and taps it to extra cover to keep strike for the final over"
18.5,"Rabada to Agarwal, 2 runs","just clears extra cover. Low full toss at off stump, backs away and looks to open the face. Barely gets it over looks like it's a run short though even though they're back for the second. Addendum: The short run was given for 18.3, but was registered by the commentator after this ball"
18.4,"Rabada to Agarwal, FOUR runs","Iyer drops it at deep midwicket! Short ball into the body, a tired aerial pull. Floated to Iyer's left and he has the reverse cups up and almost no balance as this digs into the turf and lifts over the line"
18.3,"Rabada to Agarwal, 1 run","another perfect yorker and he jams it down to long-on. Jordan quickly back for the second. Mayank on the fringes of his fitness right now, huffing and puffing."
18.2,"Rabada to Agarwal, FOUR runs",over Rabada and into the boundary. Full at middle. Mayank waiting in the leg side again with his front leg. Just misses fractionally and he gets the perfect connection to get this over the bowler. His highest IPL score
18.1,"Rabada to Agarwal, no run","perfect yorker. Follows him down leg side, pins his toes as he looks to flick this. Rabada is so so good at this"
17.6,"Sharma to Jordan, no run","swing he does, but can't connect. Disappointed too, because this was there in the slot. Good length and just outside off"
17.5,"Sharma to Agarwal, 1 run","length at middle stump, punched firmly down to long-on"
17.4,"Sharma to Agarwal, 2 runs","length at middle, soft-handed poke into the vacant midwicket region. Big boundary there and once again, Jordan is already back for the second before Mayank can call"
17.3,"Sharma to Agarwal, SIX runs","clears long-off! The rhythm is back for Mayank! Full slower ball, back of the hand, at off stump. He had already shaped to hit that off the front foot, but he had to adjust. Waited and waited and then drilled it flat and straight"
17.2,"Sharma to Agarwal, 2 runs","short ball just outside off, pulled firmly off the front foot to deep midwicket's left. Loud call for two and Jordan does his part brilliantly"
17.1,"Sharma to Agarwal, SIX runs",slices it over the backward point boundary to bring up fifty. Good length ball flung wide outside off. On his back knee and deliberately slashes this. To sweeper's left. He's keeping them interested
16.6,"Nortje to Agarwal, 1 run","low full toss at leg stump, driven firmly to long-on"
16.5,"Nortje to Jordan, 1 run","length at middle stump, mistimed slog trickles down to long-on"
16.4,"Nortje to Agarwal, 1 run","length outside off, driven on the rise to extra cover"
16.3,"Nortje to Agarwal, FOUR runs","sweetly timed again. Length ball at the stumps, backs into the leg side and carves it to sweeper's right"
16.2,"Nortje to Agarwal, no run","bouncer, just outside off. Almost waited on the back foot before attempting the hook, but he's beaten"
16.1,"Nortje to Agarwal, FOUR runs","handsome. Short of a length ball at off. He backs into the leg side and chips it on the rise, just over mid-off who is in the circle"
15.6,"Rabada to Jordan, 2 runs","short and just outside off, sliced to third man's right"
15.5,"Rabada to Jordan, no run","legcutter at a length, just outside off. Left alone"
15.4,"Rabada to Jordan, 2 runs","short of a good length at middle, tucks it behind square whee it is a comedy show. Pant slides, fine leg retreats, square leg meanders and it's through all of them"
15.3,"Rabada to Gowtham, OUT","woody sound and that is out. Cross-seam, short and in the corridor. Backs into the leg side and wants to slash this through point. Not a bad idea in principle, but not many can actually pull that off against Rabada at 142kph. Thin edge and off he goes"
15.2,"Rabada to Agarwal, 1 run","short in the corridor, gets on top of it and guides to third man"
15.1,"Rabada to Agarwal, 2 runs","dropped. Midwicket running backwards can't hang on. It's Shaw, with a late lunge towards his right. Miscued pull at a steep short ball at his chest. Floats just behind the 30-yard circle and he can't hang on"
14.6,"Sharma to Agarwal, 1 run","good length at the stumps, punched to long-on"
14.5,"Sharma to Gowtham, 1 run","length ball just outside off, shuffles and looks to clip through midwicket. Gets a leading edge to extra cover's right"
14.4,"Sharma to Agarwal, 1 run","length ball just outside off, looks to drive, gets a thick inside edge to short fine's left"
14.3,"Sharma to Gowtham, 1 run","length at off stump, drops it pitch side on the off side and they pinch a risky single from right under Mohit's nose"
14.2,"Sharma to Gowtham, FOUR runs","carted over extra cover! Short ball outside off, leaps up as it gets big on him, then swishes from inside out - like an off-forehand. From his chest, out to the cover boundary"
14.1,"Sharma to Gowtham, SIX runs","clears long-on! Right, they were always going to target Mohit. This one is a knuckle ball but he picks it. Good length ball sitting up at middle stump and he finally middles on the leg-side swing. Just over the fielder"
13.6,"Axar Patel to Agarwal, no run","short and wide outside off, cut straight to backward point"
13.5,"Axar Patel to Gowtham, 1 run","full outside off, mistimed slog again. To deep midwicket's left this time"
13.4,"Axar Patel to Agarwal, 1 run","length at off stump, pushed into the covers from the crease"
13.3,"Axar Patel to Agarwal, no run","length at off stump, looks to flick into the leg side, gets an inside edge onto the pads"
13.2,"Axar Patel to Gowtham, 1 run","lobbed up slow and full at middle stump, attempted slog is off the inside half, down to long-on"
13.1,"Axar Patel to Agarwal, 1 run","length at off stump, whippy hands for this inside-out loft to long-off's left. Rabada nearly over-runs it but adjusts to keep that in, to his right"
12.6,"Nortje to Agarwal, 1 run","slower ball at a length on leg stump, clipped down to fine leg"
12.5,"Nortje to Agarwal, FOUR runs",and again. Short of a length and width outside off. Waits leg side of that and opens the face late to send it blazing to the third man boundary
12.4,"Nortje to Agarwal, no run","length outside off, driven to extra cover"
12.3,"Nortje to Agarwal, FOUR runs","sweet. Short of a length just outside off, slight arch back, half a forward stride and rapid hands chopping through for the perfectly timed square drive past point"
12.2,"Nortje to Agarwal, no run","length at the stumps, backs away and looks to punch through the off side. Inside edge onto the body"
12.1,"Nortje to Gowtham, 3 runs","overthrows at deep midwicket after an easy run in the covers. Length outside off, pushed into the covers. Hetmyer backing up just trundles across and doesn't put in the dive. Long-on is forced to clean up to his right. Iyer and Pant both give him a scolding"
11.6,"Axar Patel to Gowtham, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punched to long-off"
11.5,"Axar Patel to Gowtham, 2 runs","short of a length outside off, punched firmly to long-off's right off the back foot"
11.4,"Axar Patel to Gowtham, no run","length on off stump, hurriedly pushed back to the bowler"
11.3,"Axar Patel to Gowtham, no run","good length outside off, punched to extra cover"
11.2,"Axar Patel to Gowtham, no run",length and sliding in at the stumps. Locks the front leg across and tickles it to midwicket
11.1,"Axar Patel to Agarwal, 1 run","length at off stump, punched to long-on with the angle, off the back foot"
10.6,"Stoinis to Agarwal, 1 run","length at middle, mistimed punch to long-on"
10.5,"Stoinis to Agarwal, SIX runs","nails that one! Hasn't nailed many so far, but this pull shot pings off sweetly. Short and up at the hips, quickly in position to send that flat and over the midwicket boundary. He's worked hard on developing that shot off the half-stride. Animated discussion with Gowtham after that - he still believes"
10.4,"Stoinis to Gowtham, 1 leg bye","length at leg stump, shuffles across and tickles it behind square"
10.3,"Stoinis to Agarwal, 1 run","length at middle stump, clipped to midwicket's right from the crease"
10.2,"Stoinis to Agarwal, no run","length at off stump, tapped to extra cover"
10.1,"Stoinis to Agarwal, no run","length on leg stump, looks to flick and gets that off the thigh to the keeper"
9.6,"Axar Patel to Khan, OUT","holes out to long-on. Flat length ball outside off, steps out and doesn't make the pitch of that. So he's forced to hit that on the rise. It comes off the inside half of the bat and finds Shaw  about five yards in from the line"
9.5,"Axar Patel to Khan, no run",short and in at off stump. Cut straight to backward point
9.4,"Axar Patel to Agarwal, 1 run",full and in at the stumps. Gets low and across and paddles this. Long leg is quick to his right
9.3,"Axar Patel to Khan, 1 run","full outside off, driven with the turn to long-off"
9.2,"Axar Patel to Agarwal, 1 run","short and just outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
9.1,"Axar Patel to Agarwal, no run","short of a length just outside off, chopped to short third"
8.6,"Stoinis to Khan, FOUR runs","drilled. Good shot that. Overpitched on off stump, half a stride and full of intent to get that exactly where he wants - to mid-off's left with the full face offered till the last moment"
8.5,"Stoinis to Agarwal, 1 run",full and driven to long-on
8.4,"Stoinis to Khan, 1 run","full on leg stump, waits on that and flicks to fine leg"

8.1,"Stoinis to Agarwal, 1 run","full at leg stump, flicked to deep square"
7.6,"Axar Patel to Agarwal, 1 run","length and sliding in at the stumps. Looks to force that through the covers, gets a thick inside edge to square leg"

6.6,"Rabada to Khan, no run","length at off stump, defended on the back foot"
6.5,"Rabada to Khan, FOUR runs","edged between slip and keeper! Slip is wide. Full and just outside off, apprehensive push out at it and a thick edge evades the diving Pant comfortably"
6.4,"Rabada to Agarwal, 1 run","length outside off, chopped to third man"
6.3,"Rabada to Maxwell, OUT","taken at mid-off! The collapse continues. Look, they left left the wristspinners out with a mind that Rabada would bowl to Maxwell. He comes on right away too and gets him, but Maxwell has played a really poor shot here. It's a length ball wide outside off, he wants to crash that through the off side, but his front leg is not far enough down and his weight is no transferred into it at all. Weak chip to the fielder. Through the shot too soon"
6.2,"Rabada to Maxwell, no run","leading edge falls short of mid-off. Looked to turn that into the leg side from off stump, closed the face too early"
6.1,"Rabada to Maxwell, no run","length at off stump, defended to point from the crease"
5.6,"Ashwin to Maxwell, 1 run","length at middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot. Ashwin looks to dive to his right to stop that and he looks like he's in pain"
5.5,"Ashwin to Pooran, OUT","through him! Ashwin is off and jumping, he is loving this! Looks like the Ashwin floater, that comes in with the angle. Classic offspin bowling. Softened him up with two danglers outside, put the doubt with a similar length and line outside off, only this time it comes back in and cleans him up. Slightly held back in his delivery stride too"
5.4,"Ashwin to Pooran, no run","length outside off, draws him well forward and makes pat it into the covers"
5.3,"Ashwin to Pooran, no run","full on middle stump, driven back to the bowler"
5.2,"Ashwin to Agarwal, 1 run","length and in at middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
5.1,"Ashwin to Nair, OUT","taken at short fine! Full ball at middle stump, looks for the sweep first up, gets a top edge that is easily taken by Shaw. Ashwin has a wicket in his first ball for DC - against his former team. Some scripts write themselves"
4.6,"Sharma to Agarwal, 2 runs","good length and just outside off, waits on that stabs to third man's right off the front foot"
4.5,"Sharma to Nair, 1 run","length outside off, mistimed punch into the covers and a fumble allows them a run"
4.4,"Sharma to Nair, no run","short of a length just outside off, angled bat on the attempted punch through the covers. Falls weakly into the covers"
4.3,"Sharma to Rahul, OUT","bowled him! Lovely seam bowling exhibition from Mohit tonight! After taking it away from Rahul all of last over, he jags this one back in. Rahul on the front foot at an off stump line, but brings down an angled bat. It's off the inside edge and crashes into leg. Top stuff from Mohit"
4.2,"Sharma to Agarwal, 1 run","short of a length outside off, chopped to third man"
4.1,"Sharma to Rahul, 1 run","length and just outside off, sliced down to third man"
3.6,"Nortje to Agarwal, no run","length at middle stump, punched straight to mid-on"
3.5,"Nortje to Rahul, 1 run","short of a good length, in at middle stump. Delicately pushed into vacant midwicket"
3.4,"Nortje to Rahul, FOUR runs","misfield at third man. Length ball seaming away again, casual drive out at that and thick edge. Rabada slides to his left but has over done it. Hits his trailing leg before rolling into the boundary"
3.3,"Nortje to Rahul, no run","oh what a ball! Unplayable. Angled in with the length, landing on the seam and moving away at 146kph as Rahul looks to tuck that into the leg side. Climbs past off stump"
3.2,"Nortje to Rahul, FOUR runs","sliced to the point boundary. Short of a length and honing in at him, but he has quick hands on this occasion and chops from inside the line. With that pace, it is into the padding rapidly"
3.1,"Nortje to Rahul, no run",beaten as he looks for the ramp to third man. Slip has gone out this over. That's rapid and getting big at him in the corridor. He arches backwards to try and steer this
2.6,"Rabada to Agarwal, no run",short and just outside off. Swivels and checks his pull after shaping too early for it. Rolls out to square leg
2.5,"Rabada to Rahul, 1 run","short of a length at off, dropped into the off side with soft hands and a loud call for the single"
2.4,"Rabada to Agarwal, 1 run",short and up in the corridor. Aerially deflected towards third man with an angled bat
2.3,"Rabada to Agarwal, no run","length at the stumps, nudged back down the pitch from the crease"
2.2,"Rabada to Rahul, 1 run",short and rising in the corridor. Nicely on top to turn it towards third man
2.1,"Rabada to Agarwal, 1 leg bye","short of a length at leg stump, hops and turns this down to fine leg"
2.1,"Rabada to Agarwal, 1 wide","short of a length and down leg side, past the attempted glance"
1.6,"Sharma to Rahul, no run","length and just outside off, watchfully tapped into the covers"
1.5,"Sharma to Rahul, no run","short of a length in the corridor, defended off the back foot"
1.4,"Sharma to Rahul, no run",leading edge as he closes the face too soon. Good length ball seaming away again from off stump
1.3,"Sharma to Rahul, SIX runs",clobbered! A throwdown type overpitched ball at middle stump. Don't do that to Rahul in this format. Front leg out of the way and no nuance about this - a big slog over midwicket
1.3,"Sharma to Rahul, (no ball)",beaten. Slides away off the pitch as he looks to punch this through the covers. Good length ball and enough to beat him but hang on! The siren's gone. Which means the TV umpire's spotted Mohit overstep
1.2,"Sharma to Rahul, 2 runs","a check-drive through the covers. Length ball with shape away. Waits on that and plays late, tapped between cover and extra"
1.1,"Sharma to Rahul, no run",good length and some shape way in the corridor. Defended off the back foot
0.6,"Nortje to Agarwal, no run","length at off stump, defended from the crease into the covers"
0.5,"Nortje to Agarwal, no run","length at middle and leg, hurries onto him. Defended to square leg off the back foot"
0.4,"Nortje to Agarwal, 4 leg byes","length and at the hips, waits on that and nudges it fine. Nice way to resume cricket or not, it's off the pads says the umpire"
0.3,"Nortje to Rahul, 1 run","length at off stump, punched on the up to extra cover's right for a quick single"
0.2,"Nortje to Rahul, no run","short of a length at off, tapped to point with an open face"
0.1,"Nortje to Rahul, no run","short and wide, a bit too quick for his attempted cut. Beaten"
19.6,"Jordan to Nortje, 3 runs","full and wide outside off, scythes from underneath and clears extra cover"
19.6,"Jordan to Stoinis, (no ball) OUT","run out coming back for a sacrificial second. Thought it was the last ball, but it seems Jordan has overstepped. Short ball outside off, cut to sweeper's left. Comes back and is caught well short. But what an innings it has been. A projected score of 127 at 17 overs when Delhi were 100 for 6 has turned into a 150-plus score"
19.5,"Jordan to Stoinis, SIX runs","fifty of 20 balls! What. An. Innings. He has deflated this bowler. It's a full toss at off stump, where he's camping. Merely flicks his wrists and sends it over the square leg boundary"
19.4,"Jordan to Stoinis, FOUR runs","crunched over extra cover! What an innings this is turning out to be. Jordan has completely fallen apart in the face of this attack and you can't fault him really. This is imperious. Full and wide outside off, yet again he's walked across. On one knee this time and drilled with purpose"
19.3,"Jordan to Stoinis, FOUR runs","whipped past short fine. Another ball in the slot, regular speed from Jordan. Stoinis in the off side once more, uses the angle and swishes it to the fine leg boundary"
19.2,"Jordan to Stoinis, FOUR runs","edge flies past the keeper. Short outside off, he's shuffles and is cramped on the cut. Just chucks the hands at it in the end and has his reward. Three balls and three different lengths from Jordan so far, none of them have been yorkers"
19.2,"Jordan to Stoinis, 1 wide","wide, but harsh? He's walking across again as he misses the flick. It's marginally past leg stump"
19.1,"Jordan to Stoinis, SIX runs","oh lovely! He has sized these KXP slog overs bowlers up. It was going to be their big question mark, and it will remain so even after this innings. Walks across the stumps and handsomely picks this length ball over the squre leg boundary. All smiles after that, he knows what an incredibly shot he's just pulled off"
18.6,"Cottrell to Ashwin, OUT","taken at third man and Cottrell finishes his spell with the salute. Slower short ball outside off, backs away and looks to ramp it. Not enough pace and third man takes it running in"
18.5,"Cottrell to Stoinis, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length at off, cut to sweeper"
18.4,"Cottrell to Stoinis, no run","slower ball, short of a length outside off. Goes back to try and carve it through point again but this rolls through low"
18.3,"Cottrell to Stoinis, FOUR runs","between backward point and short third man! Cottrell had him struggling with his last over but Stoinis has completely turned the tables now. Seems to have lost his strategy. This one is a full toss, just outside off. He's deep in the crease to slice it"
18.3,"Cottrell to Stoinis, 1 wide","full and very wide outside off, left alone"
18.2,"Cottrell to Stoinis, FOUR runs","chopped over short fine. Slower ball again, short of a length. He's backing into the off side, shaping to pull but has to wait and adjust before using his wrists to chop from underneath and clear the infield"
18.1,"Cottrell to Stoinis, FOUR runs","drilled between mid-off and extra cover. A bit predictable now this slower ball stuff, and Stoinis has sized up his options. One step to get deep in the crease for a strong base, then the front leg out of the way to create room. From thee, he crunches from inside the line"
17.6,"Jordan to Ashwin, 2 runs",legcutter attempt this time it appears. Just dies after pitching short of a length and Ashwin gets on the back foot and forces it over Jordan. A chip to clear mid-off by the end of it all.
17.5,"Jordan to Ashwin, no run","bouncer, wide outside off. Hopeful swing from under that but he can't get bat on it"
17.4,"Jordan to Ashwin, no run","slower ball at a length, skidding low outside off. Looks to chop at that and is beaten"
17.3,"Jordan to Stoinis, 1 run","attempted yorker again, punched firmly on the full to long-on's left"
17.2,"Jordan to Stoinis, FOUR runs","inside edge this time. Nutmegs himself and it whistles past short fine. He went for the yorker, it turned into a full toss. Stoinis had shuffles once more and was whipping towards the leg side"
17.1,"Jordan to Stoinis, SIX runs","oh that is skillful. Stunning execution from Stoinis. Premeditated the offcutter it appears, because he was quickly into the off side as Jordan released this. It was full and from that base, he simply went with the turn. Picked up cleanly over the midwicket boundary"
16.6,"Cottrell to Stoinis, 1 run","full outside off, chopped to sweeper cover"
16.5,"Cottrell to Stoinis, no run","beats him with the cutter. Fifth one in a row. This is fuller, inviting the cover drive before spinning away"
16.4,"Cottrell to Ashwin, 1 run","rolls his fingers over another one in the corridor. Stays on the back foot, deflects it to third man"
16.3,"Cottrell to Stoinis, 1 run","full slower ball, wide outside off stump. Driven out to sweeper cover"
16.2,"Cottrell to Ashwin, 1 run","slower ball, short of a length in the corridor. Waits on it and nudges it down to third man"
16.1,"Cottrell to Axar Patel, OUT","noise on that, and he might be out down leg side. He's walking off as the umpires convene to check if that carried to Rahul. It's a cutter, dropped short and headed for the hips. He looks to tickle it down and it dies on Rahul who gets forward and under that to lap it up. As replays confirm. It came off the glove of Patel inside edge"
15.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Stoinis, no run","googly, short of a length and cramping him on the back foot punch which rolls back down the pitch feebly"
15.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Axar Patel, 1 run","short outside off, chopped out to sweeper cover"
15.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Stoinis, 1 run","googly again, length and at leg stump. Shuffles and whips to deep square"
15.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Stoinis, no run","doesn't pick the googly at all. Tossed right up, looks for the big drive with a massive gap between bat and leg. Inside edge ends up at short fine"
15.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Axar Patel, 1 run","length, wide outside off and slowed down. Reaches out and chips to sweeper cover"
15.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Axar Patel, no run",beaten. Continues with his line across the corridor. Skidding from a length. Axar looks to feel for that and it's past him rapidly
14.6,"Shami to Axar Patel, 1 run","slower ball at a good length, hangs deep and tucks it to deep midwicket off the back foot"
14.5,"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run","length on off, punched to extra cover from the crease"
14.4,"Shami to Axar Patel, 1 run","slower ball, coming in with the angle on a good length. Inside edge onto the front pad as he shapes to poke that into the covers"
14.3,"Shami to Axar Patel, 2 runs","slower ball, short of a length outside off. Through the slog early, can only drag it over midwicket"
14.3,"Shami to Axar Patel, (no ball)",has him hopping away but at the cost of a free-hit. Second bouncer from Shami. Axar was hurrying to get out of the way as this was headed for his helmet
14.2,"Shami to Axar Patel, no run","length on middle stump, defended on the front foot"
14.1,"Shami to Iyer, OUT","taken at mid-off! One time too many from Iyer. But the bigger question - why this time? Shami brought in particularly to get another wicket immediately. It is his last over. Iyer wants to loft this slower length ball over mid-off, but this time the timing isn't there. Simple catch"
14.1,"Shami to Iyer, 1 wide","bouncer, dug in too short outside off. Left alone"
13.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, OUT","got him next ball! A first IPL wicket to remember for Bishnoi. This has been superb from the youngster. He's not only neutralised Rishabh Pant today, he's managed to dismiss him as well. Goes back to his tested line outside off, taking it away from Pant. He attempts a slog sweep and can only edge it onto the stumps. That's the end of that partnership"
13.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, FOUR runs",finally gets him away. He's struggled against him so far. This time Bishnoi just a bit too close to the stumps with the length ball. Enough margin for Pant to get on one knee and sweep him over his head to find the long-on boundary
13.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, no run","short of a length outside off, can't beat extra cover with the punch"
13.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Iyer, 1 run","on the bounce to long-on. Length ball, holds in the pitch and turns a touch. He hits on the up anyway, across the line"
13.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, 1 run","length at middle, steps out and hurriedly squeezes this to deep square"
13.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Iyer, 1 run","length at middle stump, tapped off the toe-end to long-on"
12.6,"Gowtham to Iyer, 1 run","short of a length across him, opens the face and finds short third man"
12.5,"Gowtham to Iyer, SIX runs","pumped straight again! Thrown Gowtham's plans right off! He goes fuller this time, and it's right in the arc. Gets the front leg out of the way and nails the connection"
12.4,"Gowtham to Iyer, SIX runs","clubs it over long-off this time! This is a nice little no-look six thing Iyer has developed here. Second time against Gowtham tonight. Length ball, skidding on nicely. He keeps the head down once again and goes through the line, barely looking up once he's nailed the connection"
12.3,"Gowtham to Pant, 1 run",length and slowed down at middle stump. Gently tucked through midwicket
12.2,"Gowtham to Pant, no run","beaten. Length, gripping and turning away outside off as he gets forward and looks to push through the covers"
12.1,"Gowtham to Iyer, 1 run","dug in short of a good length again. He slams them in, such that they lose pace coming at the batsman. Iyer can only tap that to long-on off the back foot"
11.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Iyer, 1 run",length and drawing him well forward outside off. Driven to long-off
11.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, 1 run","short and just outside off, finds sweeper cover with the cut"
11.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Iyer, 1 run",length and slid onto the stumps. Clipped to deep midwicket on the front foot
11.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, 1 run","length outside off, whipped to long-on off the back foot"
11.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, no run",length outside off. This one does turn back in and encumbers his attempted reverse sweep. Cops that on the pad
11.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, FOUR runs","outside edge dribbles past short third man and into the boundary. Bishnoi continues to angle it across the corridor. Pant though swings for the the turn, looking to go midwicket. Not in control of that at all"
10.6,"Gowtham to Pant, 1 run","dropped short and slow. Big heave at that, but only a single at sweeper"
10.5,"Gowtham to Iyer, 1 run",dropped short and cramps him at off stump. Punched aerially to sweeper's right
10.4,"Gowtham to Iyer, no run",beaten. Draws him forward this time. And then glides it past the bat. He's looking to drive through the covers
10.3,"Gowtham to Iyer, 2 runs","dropped short outside off, cut aerially past backward point. Agarwal cleans up to his left at sweeper cover"
10.2,"Gowtham to Iyer, 2 runs","short at leg stump, tickled to short fine's left off the back foot"
10.1,"Gowtham to Pant, 1 run","short and wide outside off, chopped to sweeper"
9.6,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punched to sweeper cover along the floor"
9.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Iyer, 1 run",length and skiddy in the corridor outside off. Poked to extra cover's left on the front foot
9.4,"Ravi Bishnoi to Iyer, no run","90kph, length at off stump, watchfully defended into the covers. That one straigthened, the first that he's turned so far"
9.3,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, 1 run","short of a length, skidding across from off stump. Hurriedly cut to sweeper cover"
9.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, no run",short and skidded across him once again. Goes away and away as he shapes to cut and he's beaten again
9.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, no run",beaten on the reverse sweep. Length and angling away from off stump again. Big swing and miss
9.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, 1 wide","slider, dropped short and pushed wide outside off. Left alone"
8.6,"Gowtham to Pant, 1 run","short at middle, pulled to deep square"
8.5,"Gowtham to Iyer, 1 run","short outside off, deflected off the outside edge to short third's left"
8.4,"Gowtham to Iyer, SIX runs","second tier! This is full-blooded, wow. Length ball pushed through quick at off stump. Keeps the head down like it's golf. And swings cleanly through the line. Not an easy shot on this kind of a pitch, because he wasn't to the pitch of that. Sends it far far over wide long-on"
8.3,"Gowtham to Iyer, no run","length outside off, knocked to point's right"
8.2,"Gowtham to Pant, 1 run",length and tossed up slower this time. Gets forward and pokes into the vacant leg side. Gowtham chases it down himself and puts in another awkward tumble. It's enough to keep them from coming back for the second
8.1,"Gowtham to Pant, FOUR runs","classic Pant! Length at middle and leg. He falls over into the off side as he gets low, opens up  some room and scoops this to the long leg boundary"
7.6,"Jordan to Pant, 1 run","good length at middle stump, nudged to midwicket from the crease"
7.5,"Jordan to Iyer, 1 run","slower ball at a good length again, waits on it and taps it down to long-on"
7.4,"Jordan to Iyer, no run",short and rising up at the chest. Chops at that and Karun Nair leaps to his left at backward point to stop the single
7.3,"Jordan to Pant, 1 run","length at middle stump, flicked to mid-on's left"
7.2,"Jordan to Pant, no run",beaten. Rolls his fingers on this short of a length ball. Pant unleashes a vicious cut at that and is well beaten
7.2,"Jordan to Pant, 1 wide","good length and down leg side, can't connect on the flick"
7.1,"Jordan to Iyer, 1 run","full on middle stump, gets the front leg across and nails the drive. Sarfaraz lunges low at midwicket to keep that to one"
6.6,"Gowtham to Iyer, 1 run","length outside off, driven firmly to Maxwell's right at extra cover. He can only get a touch on that. It ends up at long-off"
6.5,"Gowtham to Pant, 1 run",dug in short of a good length and turning away marginally outside off. Just waits on that and shovels it to deep midwicket
6.4,"Gowtham to Iyer, 1 run","length outside off, good stride forward to drive to sweeper cover"
6.3,"Gowtham to Iyer, no run","short of a length just outside off, hurried on the cut, it's off the under-edge to point"
6.2,"Gowtham to Iyer, no run","length on off stump, punched to extra cover"
6.1,"Gowtham to Pant, 1 run","short of a length at middle, punched to mid-on off the back foot"
5.6,"Shami to Iyer, no run",length and at the stumps. No room for a stroke. He hangs back and taps it down the pitch
5.5,"Shami to Iyer, no run","length on off stump, defended to backward point"
5.4,"Shami to Pant, 1 run","length at middle again, gets the front leg across and tucks this to mid-on's left"
5.3,"Shami to Pant, no run","length at middle stump, keeps a touch low. Defended down the pitch"
5.2,"Shami to Iyer, 1 run","outside edge down to third man. short of a length just outside off, swishes away from the body at this"
5.1,"Shami to Iyer, no run","length at off stump, defended into the covers off the back foot"
4.6,"Jordan to Pant, no run","length at the stumps, watchfully pushed back to the bowler"
4.5,"Jordan to Pant, no run","length and drifted into the pads. Looks for the flick, cops it on the pad"
4.4,"Jordan to Pant, FOUR runs","slapped through point! That whippy bat speed from Pant. Short and going across him, nails the connection, hits it into the turf and bisects cover point and backward point"
4.4,"Jordan to Pant, 1 wide","length and swung down leg side, beaten on the attempted flick"
4.3,"Jordan to Iyer, 3 runs","length and just outside off, stands tall and punches through the covers. Gowtham gives chase and looks to put in a slide. But his knee gets planted in the turf and he goes over. Manages to chase it down after recovering and pulls it back in"
4.2,"Jordan to Iyer, no run","short of a length at middle stump, defended to midwicket off the back foot"
4.1,"Jordan to Iyer, no run","length and in at off stump, defended from the crease"
3.6,"Shami to Hetmyer, OUT","taken at short extra cover! Oh boy, the shot selection is just not showing up today. Short of a length and across, once again. Too far away from him for him to be attempting a flick. Does it anyway, closes the face too early. It pings right off the edge and is taken by Agarwal"
3.5,"Shami to Hetmyer, no run","short of a length across him, swishes at it and is beaten on the outside edge"
3.4,"Shami to Hetmyer, FOUR runs","connects on the pull this time. This is short and up at the hips. Enough swinging room, not too much climb. He's under that and gets it over square leg"
3.3,"Shami to Shaw, OUT",taken at mid-on! More reckless cricket from Delhi against good bowling. Dropped short and rising in the corridor. He looks to pull him. Not quite the pitch to do that yet. It's off the toe and spooned to the fielder's right there
3.2,"Shami to Hetmyer, 1 run","short of a length across the corridor, has a stab at it, off the under-edge to third man"
3.1,"Shami to Hetmyer, no run",slashes and misses. Length ball angled across him and he goes horizontal bat at this
2.6,"Cottrell to Hetmyer, 1 run","length at off stump, punched to mid-off on the rise"
2.5,"Cottrell to Hetmyer, no run","length and swung away in the corridor again, defended away from the body, into the point region"
2.4,"Cottrell to Hetmyer, no run",beats the outside edge. Lovely curving outswinger from the corridor. Draws him forward and makes him push with hard hands
2.3,"Cottrell to Hetmyer, no run","length and swung away from off stump, watchfully defended into the covers"
2.2,"Cottrell to Hetmyer, no run",beaten. Short of a length and swinging away in the corridor. Plants the front leg down and has a big slog at this. Not near it
2.1,"Cottrell to Hetmyer, no run","low full toss at leg stump, tapped to mid-on"
1.6,"Shami to Hetmyer, 1 run","dropped! K Gowtham at square leg. Short ball going across him again. This time he plays the pull. It's off the toe-end. Gowtham running backwards and to his right has to put in a lunge in the end and he can't hang on. It was Maxwell at midwicket who was also close to that one, but not close enough"
1.5,"Shami to Hetmyer, no run","there's a sound! Catch behind. Rahul won't review, he signals that it might have been Hetmyer's chain.  He might be right. It's nowhere near the bat as he pokes awkwardly at this short ball rising across him"
1.4,"Shami to S Dhawan, OUT","has he dropped him? Doesn't matter, coz he runs him out anyway! KL Rahul makes amends immeidately, but Dhawan is caught napping here. It's a bouncer at his front shoulder. Looks like he gets a glove on that as he looks to hook. Rahul can't gather it high to his right. But it hasn't gone far from him. Dhawan has taken off down the pitch through it all though, with seemingly no call from Shaw at the other end. Rahul picks up, throws it in on the bounce as midwicket gathers at the striker's end and takes the bails off"
1.3,"Shami to Shaw, 1 bye","beaten on the under-edge this time. Length ball swung away, he expects that to bounce a little more than it did. Slams into the sand in front of Rahul and he can't gather cleanly"
1.2,"Shami to Shaw, no run",past the outside edge. Short of a length ball into the pitch at a middle stump line. He looks to play the flick as this shapes away and squares him up completely
1.1,"Shami to Shaw, no run","short of a length, some shape out. Punched on the rise to point"
0.6,"Cottrell to S Dhawan, no run","jumps down at this short of a good length ball and cops it on the body. No movement on this, but also no room"
0.5,"Cottrell to Shaw, 1 run",length and in at off. Punched to mid-off's left and they pinch the single
0.4,"Cottrell to Shaw, FOUR runs","full outside off, has a slash at that and gets a thick outside edge. Third man does well to cover the ground and put in a slide, but he can only parry it towards the fine leg boundary. Sarfaraz with the good attempt there"
0.3,"Cottrell to Shaw, no run","full inswinger again, driven firmly back at the bowler"
0.2,"Cottrell to Shaw, no run",overpitched and swung in at off stump. Sweetly driven along the floor to mid-off
0.1,"Cottrell to Shaw, no run",big full toss first up. Swinging in and about thigh height. Shaw wakes up at that alright! Defended down the pitch
19.2,"Boult to du Plessis, FOUR runs","swiped through midwicket to end CSK's drought against Mumbai. Short of a length slower ball sitting up at middle stump, pulled firmly off the front foot"
19.1,"Boult to du Plessis, FOUR runs","sliced over point for the tie. Slower ball, length ball, wide ball. Slashes from underneath that"
18.6,"Bumrah to Dhoni, no run","length and into the body, nudged to midwicket"
18.5,"Bumrah to Dhoni, no run","a first ball duck for Dhoni if this catch behind is upheld. Short ball past his front shoulder, he was looking to hook. Taken down leg side and given out straight away. Was there glove? Definitely no bat. No there wasn't. UltraEdge has a flat line. Decision will be overturned. There was a sound, and Dhoni reckons it was a creak in his bat - seems to be saying that to Hardik Pandya"
18.4,"Bumrah to du Plessis, 1 run","slower short ball outside off, mistimed punch to extra cover's right and Faf du Plessis has a fifty too"
18.3,"Bumrah to du Plessis, FOUR runs","clears extra cover with ease. That is a poor ball. Slower ball, short and very wide. No concealing that, there was so so much time. He waits on that and cuts it aerially"
18.2,"Bumrah to Sam Curran, OUT","oh well taken Pattinson. More backpeddling stuff from Mumbai. Curran brings out the ramp, connects on it too, but Pattinson has kept his eyes on it running backwards before smashing the ball into his chest. The perfect T20 cameo from Curran - 18 off 6 is total value - ends with CSK in sight of a win"
18.1,"Bumrah to Sam Curran, SIX runs","just clears deep midwicket! Who was running backwards for some reason. Was he in from the line to start with? Yes he was. Ten yards in from the line, so it wasn't misjudgement. This is a slower ball, short of a good length and he swung at it, cleanly. Stuck with and managed to drag it. Would have been taken if the fielder was on the line"
17.6,"Krunal to Sam Curran, 1 run","low full toss at middle again, slugged out to deep midwicket"
17.5,"Krunal to Sam Curran, FOUR runs","slapped over extra cover! Dropped short of a good length outside off. Reaches out, waits on it as it sits up and flat-bats it to the extra cover boundary"
17.4,"Krunal to Sam Curran, SIX runs","smokes it over deep midwicket! Another attempted yorker, but this is a full toss. Front leg out of the way, pummels it"
17.3,"Krunal to du Plessis, 1 run","yorker at leg stump, backs into the leg side, can only squeeze it with the angle to deep square"
17.2,"Krunal to Sam Curran, 1 run","yorker length outside off, steps out and carves hurriedly down to long-off"
17.1,"Krunal to Jadeja, OUT","doesn't go well for Jadeja! This is plumb in front. Full and fast, no nuance from Krunal. It's fired in at middle stump like he's giving him throwdowns. Jadeja tries to flick that though and is caught right in front of middle"
16.6,"Pattinson to Jadeja, 1 run","length and into the body, flicked through square leg"
16.5,"Pattinson to Jadeja, FOUR runs",feeds him outside off! A knee high full toss and he merely has to open the face at that. Sprints to the point boundary
16.4,"Pattinson to du Plessis, 1 run","lands between extra cover and sweeper. Short ball rising up in the corridor. Backs away and looks to paddle that over the covers. Slices it and three fielders converge, without one getting close"
16.3,"Pattinson to du Plessis, 2 runs","slower short ball at middle stump, check-pull off the front foot. Between deep square and deep midwicket"
16.2,"Pattinson to Jadeja, 1 run","short of a length at leg stump, off his feet to whip to fine leg"
16.1,"Pattinson to Jadeja, FOUR runs","poor start from Pattinson. Full and on the pads, Jadeja just waits on that and turns it fine"
15.6,"Chahar to Rayudu, OUT","holds onto it himself after sprinting backwards! Superbly done from Chahar. It was coming all over. They were stepping down, swinging hard at Chahar who they clearly wanted to cash in on in his last over. This one lands at a good length, outside off. Rayudu ends up slicing it after not making the pitch. It hangs in the mid-off area and he keeps his eyes on it coming from over his shoulder and holds onto it. Confidently done as he ends his spell with Rayudu's wicket. A sensational knock from him"
15.5,"Chahar to du Plessis, 1 run","well short of long-on. Length ball, steps out and makes the pitch of it but it comes off the toe-end of the bat."
15.4,"Chahar to Rayudu, 1 run","dropped short, steps out and under-edges the pull to short fine"
15.3,"Chahar to du Plessis, 1 run","length at middle, swept on the bounce to deep square"
15.2,"Chahar to Rayudu, 1 run","dropped at backward point! Tough one to the right for Krunal. He dives and can't hold on. It's a good length ball on off stump, he brings out the reverse sweep and wants to clear the infield behind square on the off side. Doesn't get the elevation. Krunal got there but can't complete"
15.1,"Chahar to du Plessis, 1 run","dropped short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
14.6,"Bumrah to Rayudu, 2 runs","yorker at the toes, following him down leg side. Manages to tickle it fine - not yet sure if it's off bat or pad. PAttinson sprints and slides to keep it in to his right"
14.6,"Bumrah to Rayudu, 1 wide","attempted slow bouncer, too short and well down leg side"
14.5,"Bumrah to Rayudu, 2 runs","run out call at the striker's end! Sent upstairs. He's run off a misfield, that thing they tell you not to do as a child but he's safe. Full ball flicked to midwicket's left, he doesn't collect leans and they take him on"
14.4,"Bumrah to du Plessis, 1 run","yorker at the stumps, squeezed pitch side"
14.3,"Bumrah to du Plessis, FOUR runs",sweet skills! Backs into the leg side and opens up the gap to mid-off's left. It's a length ball that slides on and he punches firmly for the boundary
14.2,"Bumrah to Rayudu, 1 run","yorker at the stumps, jammed down to long-on"
14.1,"Bumrah to Rayudu, no run","jumps down at a short ball, catches it on the grille off the bat as he's late on the hook"
13.6,"Pattinson to Rayudu, 1 run",audacious! Doing whatever he wants right now. This is a full ball speared in at off. Casually walks across and whips this to deep square
13.5,"Pattinson to du Plessis, 1 run","slower short ball at middle, shoveled down to fine leg"
13.4,"Pattinson to Rayudu, 1 run","good length and into the body. Looks to swivel and turn that fine, but it comes off the cue end and ends up at deep square"
13.3,"Pattinson to Rayudu, 2 runs","slapped through extra cover. Whew. Slower ball, good length and outside off. Camps on the back foot and hits through the line. Boult sprints, slides, and gets his body behind it this time to keep it in"
13.2,"Pattinson to Rayudu, no run","beaten. Charges him and is beaten on the under-edge. This was banged in short of a good length, sailing over leg stump"
13.1,"Pattinson to du Plessis, 1 run","short outside off, pulled firmly to long-on's right"
12.6,"Chahar to du Plessis, 1 run","length at middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"

12.3,"Chahar to Rayudu, 1 run","length at the stumps, chipped into the midwicket area"
12.2,"Chahar to Rayudu, SIX runs","glorious! This is batsman in full control. Steps out, gets to the pitch of this good length ball outside off and then opens his body to send this over wide long-off. Imperious"
12.1,"Chahar to du Plessis, 1 run","length at middle stump, steps out and punches to long-on"
11.6,"Bumrah to Rayudu, no run","length outside off, punched to extra cover off the back foot"
11.5,"Bumrah to Rayudu, FOUR runs","a fingertip on that from Bumrah and he's lucky because that might have caused damage if he'd gotten more. Rayudu has fifty. Holds this top order together regularly, and he's doing it again. Down the pitch to a short ball as he flat-bats this to the straight boundary"
11.4,"Bumrah to Rayudu, no run",beaten as that gets big on him. Short of a length and straightens as he shuffles and pushes for the angle coming into him
11.3,"Bumrah to du Plessis, 1 run","slower ball outside off, sitting up from a good length. Punched to sweeper's left"
11.2,"Bumrah to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length outside off, chopped to third man off the back foot"

10.4,"Krunal to du Plessis, 1 run","full on leg stump, angles in, flicks to deep square"
10.3,"Krunal to Rayudu, 1 run","full on leg stump, flicked to short fine's left"
10.2,"Krunal to Rayudu, SIX runs","that is incredibly done. Far and away the best batsman of the match so far. Rayudu has jumped down the track and Krunals drags it short. Still, from that position, he's managed to make room and have enough swinging power to pull it over wide long-on"
10.1,"Krunal to du Plessis, 1 run",quicker one as Faf jumps down the pitch. Nearly yorks himself. Has just managed to squeeze it down to long-off
9.6,"Chahar to du Plessis, 1 run","full on middle, swept straight to deep square leg"
9.5,"Chahar to Rayudu, 1 run","length at middle, clipped through midwicket"
9.4,"Chahar to Rayudu, FOUR runs","oh dear another misfield, and this is unpardonable from Boult. One of the best outfielders in the world. Full ball carved to deep extra's right. Boult sprints across and it bounces up for him at a comfortable height. Ends up completely missing it. Expect a bit of this in the opening stages of the tournament"
9.3,"Chahar to Rayudu, FOUR runs",misfield at short fine from Bumrah. This is dragged short and down leg. He pulls off the inside edge and Bumrah's just gone over it
9.2,"Chahar to du Plessis, 1 run","length and turning away from middle, gets deep in the crease and flicks to deep midwicket"
9.1,"Chahar to Rayudu, 1 run",full and drifted into the pads. Leans in and flicks to deep square
8.6,"Krunal to Rayudu, 1 run","length and angled into the pads, flicked with the angle to deep square"
8.5,"Krunal to du Plessis, 1 run","short of a length, low and at the stumps. Sluggish pull down to long-on"
8.4,"Krunal to Rayudu, 1 run","length on off, punched down to long-off"
8.3,"Krunal to du Plessis, 1 run","short of a length at off, punched to sweeper cover"
8.3,"Krunal to du Plessis, 1 wide","length and down leg side, left alone"
8.2,"Krunal to Rayudu, 1 run","dropped? That almost carried to Chahar at midwicket. A tough one low to his right, but he didn't even get a hand on that. Got forward and flicked hurriedly. Straight through him"
8.1,"Krunal to du Plessis, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
7.6,"Chahar to du Plessis, 1 run","length outside off, steps out and drives to long-off with the turn"
7.5,"Chahar to du Plessis, FOUR runs","expertly done. Jumps down the track and doesn't make the pitch of this, but goes from down to up and then inside to out. Opens the face at the perfect time, it's not easy on this pitch, and beats long-off to the left"
7.4,"Chahar to du Plessis, no run","length on off stump, defended to extra cover on the front foot"
7.3,"Chahar to Rayudu, 1 run","legbreak from a good length at off, gets back and flicks to deep midwicket"
7.2,"Chahar to du Plessis, 1 run","length at off stump and sticking in the pitch as Faf goes half-stride and well in front of the body, flicks into vacant midwicket"
7.1,"Chahar to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length at off stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
6.6,"Krunal to Rayudu, 1 run",length and slanted in at middle. Gets forward and flicks to deep midwicket
6.5,"Krunal to Rayudu, 2 runs","short outside off, punched to sweeper's left off the back foot"
6.4,"Krunal to Rayudu, no run","length at the stumps, tapped back with the angle, can't beat the bowler to his right"
6.3,"Krunal to du Plessis, 1 run","length and skidding low at the stumps. Looks to whip to deep midwicket, gets an inside edge into the short fine region"
6.2,"Krunal to Rayudu, 1 run","length and into the stumps, punched to deep midwicket"
6.1,"Krunal to du Plessis, 1 run","lobbed up gently, good length and wide outside off. Reaches out and chops to sweeper cover"
5.6,"Bumrah to Rayudu, SIX runs","looooong way back! Bumrah's no-ball costs him big. Short ball in the corridor, stays back and connects cleanly on the pull shot - way in front of square, over the wide long-on region"
5.6,"Bumrah to Rayudu, (no ball) FOUR runs","whistles over backward point! Effective Powerplay batting. Stays leg side and low at this length ball that is wide outside off. And then slices firmly with no intent to keep it down. It is also a no-ball, as picked up by the TV umpire."
5.5,"Bumrah to du Plessis, 3 runs","short of a length outside off, walks into the off side and forces that between cover and extra cover. Bit of relay work at the boundary between Chahar and Pollard"
5.4,"Bumrah to du Plessis, no run",bursts through him. Good length and jagging back in strongly. He's trapped in the crease trying to react as that narrowly misses off stump
5.3,"Bumrah to du Plessis, no run",short of a length and into his mid-riff. Looks to turn that with the angle but can only get it pitch side via his thigh guard
5.2,"Bumrah to du Plessis, no run","short of a length just outside off, punched off the back foot, straight to backward point"
5.1,"Bumrah to du Plessis, no run","short of a length just outside off, punched into the covers"
4.6,"Boult to Rayudu, no run",past the outside edge. Playing on his mind with the movement in and away. This one goes on with the angle. Tentative poke from Rayudu on the front foot and he's too late on it
4.5,"Boult to Rayudu, no run",short of a length with some shape in from outside off. Left alone
4.4,"Boult to Rayudu, no run",short of a length and across off stump. Chopped straight to backward point
4.3,"Boult to Rayudu, no run",past the edge. With a cutter. Gets him forward in the corridor and past the bat
4.2,"Boult to Rayudu, no run","length on off stump, defended towards backward point"
4.1,"Boult to Rayudu, FOUR runs","wow, sweeeet. I think we have the most aesthetically pleasing shot of the match. Good length ball going across him, gets low, half a flex of the knee to get his weight into that and the perfect cover drive"
3.6,"Pattinson to du Plessis, 2 runs","overpitched on the toes, sweet connection on the flick to deep square's left"
3.5,"Pattinson to du Plessis, no run",trapped in the crease trying to flick with the angle. Half an appeal from the bowler who banged this in at a good length. Struck him on the thigh guard
3.4,"Pattinson to Rayudu, 1 run","offcutter at a good length, not disguised well enough to trouble Rayudu. Waits on that and guides to third man off the front foot"
3.3,"Pattinson to Rayudu, no run",length and in the corridor. That's skidded on rapidly as he gets forward and defends
3.2,"Pattinson to Rayudu, no run","length on middle stump, defended off the back foot"
3.1,"Pattinson to Rayudu, FOUR runs",slapped away! Reflexes look good there for Rayudu. Short and wide and he crunches it in front of square off the back foot
2.6,"Boult to du Plessis, FOUR runs",sweet timing. Length ball wide outside off. Reaches out and just caresses that to mid-off's left
2.5,"Boult to du Plessis, no run",big swing inwards. Has Faf cramped. He was shaping to chop that down to third man
2.4,"Boult to Rayudu, 1 run","short of a length outside off, uses the angle to stab that to third man"
2.3,"Boult to Rayudu, no run","good length, on the pads, and he's caught on the pads trying to flick that"
2.2,"Boult to du Plessis, 1 run",length and a bit of shape in. Gets on the front foot and gets it off the thick outside edge to third man
2.1,"Boult to du Plessis, no run","short of a length and wide outside off, left aloe"
1.6,"Pattinson to Vijay, OUT","has him this time! But is that going down? It could well be looks very good actually for a batsman's review. He doesn't take it. He's off and Faf has to actually catch him halfway back to try and talk to him about it. A full ball pitching middle, cutting in off the seam. He's beaten on the flick but there was a big deviation. Vijay was completely out of sorts - as he looked on the field too - and I wonder if that has affected his judgement. Replays suggest it was missing. He walked right off."
1.5,"Pattinson to Vijay, no run","length and in at the body, hurriedly poked into the leg side"
1.4,"Pattinson to Vijay, no run","big lbw apeal after he's foxed by the slower ball. They decide against the review. That was superbly done by Pattinson. Vijay trapped in the crease after the last three deliveries. This is a good length ball, tossed up. Vijay absolutely static, reaching well in front of the body to try and lift it over the leg side. It looked very good, but they decide against the review. So so close. Did they think it was lifting over the stumps?"
1.3,"Pattinson to Vijay, no run","length at off stump, punched firmly from the crease to mid-on"
1.2,"Pattinson to Vijay, no run","short outside off, another languid swish at that. It's off the inside edge to midwicket"
1.2,"Pattinson to Vijay, 1 wide","short of a length and down leg side, beaten on the flick"
1.1,"Pattinson to Vijay, no run","beats the inside edge. Banged short of a good length, jagging in off the seam. Vijay swishing away from the body for the one that goes straight on"
0.6,"Boult to Watson, OUT",massive appeal and he's given lbw. Won't review it. That is dead in front. Full and swinging in sharply from off stump. Watson looking to drive for the initial line. Front leg is in the leg side and this thuds into the back one. Long appeal and then a long wait before Virender Sharma lifts the finger
0.5,"Boult to Watson, FOUR runs","lifts it over the off-side infield. Classic Watson. Classy Watson. Full and wide outside off, down on his back knee like he does and from there, he just goes over. Sweetly executed"
0.4,"Boult to Watson, no run","short of a length and shape into the body. Late cut straight to wide slip, on the bounce"
0.3,"Boult to Watson, no run","length on off, defended into the covers off the back foot"
0.2,"Boult to Watson, no run",full and curving in from wide outside off. Looks for the booming cover drive but it's off the inside of the bat
0.1,"Boult to Vijay, 1 run","length at middle stump, slight wobble but not big movement. Keeps the front pad out of the way and taps to mid-on"
19.6,"Chahar to Bumrah, 2 runs","overpithced at middle stump, clears the front leg and slogs to long-on's right. Comes back for the second"
19.5,"Chahar to Bumrah, 2 runs","leading edge just clears extra cover. Full and wide outside off, looks to slog. Head's looking leg side, the runs are on the off"
19.4,"Chahar to Chahar, 1 run","another slower short ball. Hooks and connects this time, but straight to Jadeja at deep midwicket"
19.3,"Chahar to Chahar, no run",beaten. Slower short ball in the corridor. Looks for the hook and can't connect
19.2,"Chahar to Bumrah, 1 run","full outside off, gets forward and flicks to deep midwicket"
19.1,"Chahar to Boult, OUT",loses his leg stump. Short of good length. Walks into the leg side and swings at that. Completely misses it
18.6,"Ngidi to Chahar, no run","yorker outside off, watchfully kept out"
18.5,"Ngidi to Pattinson, OUT","holes out to long-on. It's that slam-in length again, just short of a good one. Going across the left hander. He's backing away and doesn't have a strong base for this pull. Just catching practice by the end of it, well within the playing area"
18.4,"Ngidi to Pattinson, no run","short of a length at leg stump, swishes across the line and is beaten. It clears leg stump"
18.3,"Ngidi to Pattinson, FOUR runs","dropped short at middle, pulled firmly to deep square's right and Deepak Chahar completely misses that. Covered the ground and got down at it, but was in a hurry to throw it back. Through his legs"
18.2,"Ngidi to Chahar, 1 run","length on middle stump, stays deep in the crease and clips into the leg side"
18.1,"Ngidi to Pollard, OUT","caught behind! They've come screaming back, have CSK. The rising awkward ball does it again for Ngidi. This is lifting in the corridor from a short length. Pollard has room, to be fair, and  he tries to hoick it behind square. But it's a bit too quick for him and the edge is a straightforward catch for Dhoni this time"
17.6,"Sam Curran to Pollard, 1 leg bye",big appeal for lbw. Turned down. He got across the stumps and looked to clip that from off stump. Struck in front of off. Or was it outside?
17.5,"Sam Curran to Pollard, no run","length outside off, driven back at the bowler who throws it back off balance. It's in the corridor, Pollard leaves it alone"
17.4,"Sam Curran to Pollard, FOUR runs",nudged past short fine. Attempted yorker is a full toss on Pollard's pads. Barely has to do anything with that
17.3,"Sam Curran to Pattinson, 1 run","offcutter at a length on leg stump, forcefully whipped out to deep backward square"
17.2,"Sam Curran to Pattinson, FOUR runs","get outta the way, Sam! Gets it full and at middle stump. Pattinson into the leg side, two steps, and drills it past the bowler's head. Mid-off is in the circle"
17.1,"Sam Curran to Pollard, 1 run","offcutter at off stump, shuffles and uses the angle to flick to deep square"
16.6,"Ngidi to Pattinson, no run","short and across the corridor, beaten on a boisterous attempted pull shot"
16.5,"Ngidi to Pollard, 1 run","short outside off, dropped in front of Vijay at midwicket. Soft hands and pinches the run from CSK's sloppiest fielder this evening"
16.4,"Ngidi to Pattinson, 1 run","short and up at the hips, pulled away to deep midwicket"
16.3,"Ngidi to Pollard, 1 run","length and into middle stump, Shuffles and flicks to deep midwicket's right"
16.2,"Ngidi to Pattinson, 1 run","short of a length just outside off, sliced to third man"
16.1,"Ngidi to Krunal, OUT","taken down leg side! Short ball cramps him at the hips. An awkward glance, off the inside edge. Dhoni stretches to his right and holds on low"
15.6,"Chawla to Pollard, 2 runs","googly dropped short outside off, chopped to sweeper's left"
15.5,"Chawla to Pollard, no run","short of a length outside off, closes the face too early and gets a leading edge to extra cover"
15.4,"Chawla to Krunal, 1 run",full googly at middle and off. Driven through cover
15.3,"Chawla to Pollard, 1 run","googly at a length on off stump, hard-handed jab into the leg side"
15.2,"Chawla to Pollard, SIX runs","yeah, don't bother. Googly, tossed right up. There's gap between bat and pad, but it doesn't matter when you have Pollard's reach. Lofts it easily to clear the straight boundary"
15.1,"Chawla to Pollard, no run","googly outside off, watchfully defended on the front foot"
14.6,"Jadeja to Krunal, 2 runs","length at leg stump, clipped through midwicket with the turn"
14.5,"Jadeja to Pandya, OUT","Faf you stunner! Wow! What a fielder. This is flat and full, right in Pandya's arc. Which means he's absolutely smoked this, flat and to Faf's right at long-off. He takes strides across, jumps perfectly as it's in danger of whistling past him. Then the magic - the gentlest of landings after all the effort of sprinting and jumping. That landing gives him balance. and he hangs on, and is already in control as he comes down. Lobs it up as a formality anyway, but he had that down. Pure artistry from Faf, and he has changed the course of this game as of now."
14.4,"Jadeja to Pollard, 1 run","length on leg stump, nudged through midwicket off the back foot"
14.3,"Jadeja to Pandya, 1 run","length outside off, mistimed punch back down the pitch. Jadeja parries it to long-off"
14.2,"Jadeja to Pollard, 1 run",length and sliding onto the pads. Anxiously jabbed through square leg on the front foot
14.1,"Jadeja to Tiwary, OUT","taken at long-on. Faf with the lob back in to take it on the second attempt. You'd pick him to be the man in that situation, wouldn't you? Certainly among the best in the world at this skill. Slog sweep for a length ball outside off, decently connected. Faf leaps up, lands inside safely, lobs it up, takes a quick step out and back into play and hangs on. Impressive knock from Tiwary though, he's set it up nicely"
13.6,"Chawla to Pandya, no run","length outside off, punched back to the bowler"
13.5,"Chawla to Tiwary, 1 run","short of a length outside off, punched to sweeper cover"
13.4,"Chawla to Tiwary, no run","googly, full outside off. Down for the sweep, struck on the back thigh. They've appealed for lbw and it is turned down. They review. Looked to miss off stump for me, with the turn and ball tracker confirms that. CSK lose the review."
13.3,"Chawla to Tiwary, 2 runs","full at leg stump, swept firmly to deep square's left. Vijay covers the ground and then fumbles. They come back for the second"
13.2,"Chawla to Pandya, 1 run","full outside off, throws his hands at it and gets an inside edge past his boot"
13.1,"Chawla to Tiwary, 1 run","full on off stump, jumps down and jams it out to long-off"
12.6,"Ngidi to Pandya, no run","short of a length outside off, shuffles and cramps himself. Tapped to midwicket"
12.5,"Ngidi to Tiwary, 1 run","short of a length at leg stump, watchfully turned off his hips to deep square's left"
12.4,"Ngidi to Tiwary, FOUR runs","drilled past the non-striker! Length outside off, steps down the track and imposes himself on an apprehensive bowler. Beats mid-off to is left"
12.3,"Ngidi to Tiwary, FOUR runs","oh sweet. Short of a length at middle, sits up and he pulls flat off the front foot. One bounce and into the midwicket boundary"
12.2,"Ngidi to Tiwary, 2 runs",just past mid-off. He was backing away and reaching out at this length ball going across him. Toe-ended to Curran's right
12.1,"Ngidi to Tiwary, no run","full outside off, clears the front leg and drills it to mid-off"
11.6,"Jadeja to Pandya, SIX runs","this one is smoked! No chance for the fielder now. Short of a length, sitting up at middle stump. Gets deep in the crease and carts it off the back foot. Brutal hit"
11.5,"Jadeja to Pandya, SIX runs","completely misjudged at deep midwicket! A mistimed slog sweep. The fielder runs in, and then back, and it would have only just cleared him by the looks of it - if he was on the line, that is"
11.4,"Jadeja to Pandya, no run","length and in at leg, clipped straight to midwicket"
11.3,"Jadeja to Pandya, no run","length and slid into middle, punched to midwicket off the back foot"
11.2,"Jadeja to Pandya, no run","length on off stump, hurriedly punched back to the bowler"
11.1,"Jadeja to Tiwary, 1 run","short and wide outside off, cut firmly to sweeper cover"
10.6,"Chahar to Yadav, OUT","taken at long-on! Curran involved again. This looked a decent shot at first. Length ball at middle stump, full face offered as he lofted this. Nice sound and all. But it's taken well inside the line"
10.6,"Chahar to Yadav, 1 wide",slower ball dropped very short and down leg side. Beaten on the pull
10.5,"Chahar to Tiwary, 1 run","short and just outside off, pulled to square leg's right"
10.4,"Chahar to Tiwary, 2 runs","short outside off, looks for the pull as it angles away from him. But that really took a while coming to him. Swatted to long-on's right"
10.3,"Chahar to Yadav, 1 run","offcutter, back of a length and cramps him as he looks for the late cut. Chopped onto the body off the inside edge"
10.2,"Chahar to Yadav, no run","length and just outside off, punched to mid-off on the rise"
10.1,"Chahar to Tiwary, 1 run","knuckle ball it looks like. Length at off stump, punched on the up to long-off"
9.6,"Chawla to Yadav, no run","length ball wide outside off, gets down and swipes vigorously at that. Beaten by the legbreak"
9.5,"Chawla to Tiwary, 1 run","length at middle stump, punched to deep midwicket off the back foot"
9.4,"Chawla to Tiwary, no run","googly at a length on middle stump, watchfully defended on the front foot"
9.3,"Chawla to Tiwary, no run","googly at leg stump, can't turn that away off the pitch"
9.2,"Chawla to Yadav, 1 run","googly at a length outside off, looks to launch another one over extra cover but once again through it early. Down to long-on again"
9.1,"Chawla to Yadav, no run","googly tossed right up outside off, drilled straight to Jadeja at extra cover"
9.1,"Chawla to Yadav, 1 wide",length and skidding low down leg side. Left alone
8.6,"Jadeja to Yadav, 1 run","length and skidding in from outside off. Doesn't pick it. Wants to drive through the covers, but it's down to long-on off the thick inside half"
8.5,"Jadeja to Tiwary, 1 run","length ball wide outside off, laboured sweep, dragged out to long-on"
8.4,"Jadeja to Tiwary, FOUR runs","short and wide outside off, waits and waits and cuts gratefully to the backward point boundary"
8.3,"Jadeja to Tiwary, 2 runs","short of a length outside off, chopped to short third and a misfield from Lungi allows a second"
8.2,"Jadeja to Tiwary, SIX runs","just clears long-on! Looked a risky shot, but this guy has got big muscles. Length ball on middle, didn't get to the pitch and had to lift that on the up. High on the bat, but just clear"
8.1,"Jadeja to Yadav, 1 run","looks for the booming inside-out drive again, but he's through it too soon this time. It trickles down to long-off. A full ball on off"
7.6,"Sam Curran to Yadav, 1 run","offcutter at a length on leg stump, flicked to deep square off the back foot"
7.5,"Sam Curran to Yadav, FOUR runs","he's made that boundary for himself. Front leg into the leg side and he waited. The offcutter was at his body, but he managed to slice from inside it and beat Chawla's dive to the right at third man"
7.4,"Sam Curran to Tiwary, 1 run","short and at the body, mistimed pull out to deep square leg"
7.3,"Sam Curran to Tiwary, no run",beaten. Full and jagging away off the pitch as he looks to drive through the cover on the front foot. Was probably playing for the cutter into him
7.2,"Sam Curran to Yadav, 1 run","short of a length outside off, chopped to third man"
7.1,"Sam Curran to Tiwary, 1 run","offcutter at a length outside off, punched on the up to sweeper cover"

6.5,"Jadeja to Yadav, 1 run","full at off, jammed down to long-off"
6.4,"Jadeja to Tiwary, 1 run","short of a length outside off, chopped to short third"
6.3,"Jadeja to Yadav, 1 run","length and in at the stumps, gets forward and chips to long-on"
6.2,"Jadeja to Yadav, FOUR runs","brilliant. This is what SKY is known for. Slow pitch or not, this guy is a specialist against spin. And it's because of those wrists. Full on off, inside out and calmly lifted over extra cover with the turn"
6.1,"Jadeja to Tiwary, 1 run","full and wide outside off, gets forward and drives to long-off"
5.6,"Sam Curran to Yadav, no run","length and in the corridor, punched back at the bowler on the up"
5.5,"Sam Curran to Tiwary, 1 run","length outside off, gets well forward and jabs it into the covers with soft hands"
5.4,"Sam Curran to Tiwary, no run","offcutter at a length outside off, pushes with hard hands and it ends up at midwicket off the thick inside edge"
5.3,"Sam Curran to Tiwary, 2 runs","length at leg stump, allows that on, nudged to deep square's right"
5.2,"Sam Curran to Tiwary, no run","length at off stump, watchfully nudged into the covers"
5.1,"Sam Curran to de Kock, OUT","straight to midwicket! Slow does it! Spin at the other end, and an offcutter here from Curran. Welcome to the UAE. Short of a length at middle stump, clears the front leg and slugs this straight to the fielder. It's gone slowly too, perhaps an indication that this pitch won't give you too much pace. He really swung hard at that but it sort of loops on the fielder by the end"
4.6,"Chawla to de Kock, 1 run","googly, short of a length at off stump. Punched to long-on off the back foot"
4.5,"Chawla to Yadav, 1 run","googly at a length outside off, driven to extra cover's right"
4.4,"Chawla to Rohit Sharma, OUT","chipped straight to mid-off! Full on off stump, wants to loft that over the fielder. Might have come off too at Wankhede. This pitch a touch slower. And Rohit's bad relationship with legbreak bowling continues. Taken at the edge of the circle and CSK's gamble has paid off"
4.3,"Chawla to Rohit Sharma, no run","googly at a length outside off, blocked on the front foot"
4.2,"Chawla to de Kock, 1 run","googly, full at off stump. Driven to mid-off"
4.1,"Chawla to de Kock, no run",beaten on the reverse sweep. Googly in the corridor. Dhoni gathers that at knee height
3.6,"Ngidi to de Kock, 1 run","vicious swipe from underneath, short ball outside off. Sliced and ends up bobbling to deep point's right"
3.5,"Ngidi to de Kock, FOUR runs","oh and he's outwitted him after all! Actually steps across this time for the ramp. Lungi has tried to curb that the last few balls. Doesn't this time and he's lost the battle again. Coz this is short of a length, heading right into QDK's body and he gently nudges that to the fine leg boundary"
3.5,"Ngidi to de Kock, 1 wide","full and very very wide outside off, left alone"
3.4,"Ngidi to de Kock, FOUR runs","no-nonsense. Short of a length at middle stump, front leg in the leg side and an old fashioned slog across the line, one bounce over the long-on boundary"
3.4,"Ngidi to de Kock, 1 wide","slower ball, short and very wide as QDK does a small shimmy again. Lets this one go"
3.3,"Ngidi to de Kock, 2 runs","chopped to deep backward point's right. QDK was shaping for the ramp over short fine, Lungi pushed it wide outside off. He coped. To put it mildly"
3.2,"Ngidi to de Kock, FOUR runs","oh my, that is gorgeous. Just brilliant. Overpitched outside off, plants half a stride down and drills it over the non-striker with no fuss at all"
3.1,"Ngidi to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length and into the pads. Half a stride, neatly tucked to long leg's left. Chahar does well to sprint and cover his ground there"
2.6,"Chahar to de Kock, 2 runs","length at middle stump, clears the front leg and creams this on the up. Sam Curran flies to his left at mid-off and can only parry it for mid-on to clean up"
2.5,"Chahar to de Kock, FOUR runs","slower ball, dropped just a shade too short. QDK saps across the line to beat deep square. Sits up nicely for him, he makes room and it's not completely off the middle. But far enough in front of deep square"
2.4,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","overpitched and driven firmly to Faf at mid-off, who tumbles. That's stung his right hand, but he's saved three"
2.3,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, no run","full on leg stump, flicked straight to midwicket"
2.2,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, no run","length at the stumps, mistimed drive on the up to mid-on"
2.1,"Chahar to de Kock, 1 run","length at the stumps, makes room to try and chop but this cramps him. Under-edge into the point region"
1.6,"Sam Curran to de Kock, 1 run","length at the stumps, opens up his stance and jabs it with soft hands into the covers"
1.5,"Sam Curran to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length outside off, driven on the up to mid-off's left. And we have a second misfield already. Looks like Faf this time"
1.4,"Sam Curran to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs",swats it away. Length and wide outside off. No swing in. Rohit reaches out a long way and connects on that to beat backward point to the right
1.3,"Sam Curran to de Kock, 1 run","short and wide outside off, allows that to come on and chops to deep backward point. Third man was in the circle"
1.2,"Sam Curran to de Kock, no run","drilled straight to mid-off. Full at off, gets the front leg out of the way and creams it on the bounce"
1.1,"Sam Curran to de Kock, no run","floated full and into the pads, searching for some swing. Goes on straight but QDK can't get the flick away"
0.6,"Chahar to de Kock, 1 run","length and wide outside off, looks to slap that on the rise and mistimes towards mid-off"
0.5,"Chahar to de Kock, no run","short of a length outside off, chopped straight to point"
0.4,"Chahar to de Kock, FOUR runs",whipped! Overpitched on the legs and he stands tall and picks the midwicket boundary with no fuss
0.3,"Chahar to de Kock, 2 runs",full and curving into off stump. Driven off the thick inside edge towards mid-on where M Vijay dives over the ball. Cobwebs. QDK back for the second
0.2,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, 1 run","length at off stump, waits on that and turns it to mid-on's right"
0.1,"Chahar to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs","no delays from Rohit! Outswinger at a length, curving away, but way too slow onto the bat. He waits on it and taps it between cover and point on the rise"
